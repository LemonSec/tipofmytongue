1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,840
okay so good morning

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,680
uh good afternoon and even good evening

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,240
for some of you uh welcome back from

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,920
this session so yesterday we had this

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,920
session about the introduction of myth

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,400
and today we will talk mainly about uh

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,839
community buildings

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,560
deployment of mist and some additional

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,359
usage of

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,000
especially on synchronization feet

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,039
sharing groups and extension of me

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,160
and first of all um what i want to talk

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,880
today

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,238
and on russia too is about building

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,680
sharing communities and i think that's

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,320
something that

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,040
we did for the past years and we had a

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,239
lot of feedback

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,879
experiences to share with you um so at

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,480
the same time if you want to

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,600
ask questions don't hesitate we'll try

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,120
to answer them live

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,520
so don't hesitate to use the question

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,960
and answer applications in

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,480
zoom to directly give your questions

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,719
i will try to answer those directly

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,800
so the thing is and that the the plan

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,079
for for this

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,280
first part is about the information and

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,119
sharing aspects and how it's

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,320
clearly changed our daily life um radio

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,200
super tool for doing information sharing

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,159
we started to use it in 2012 as a kind

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:16,960
of

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,400
very specific case of sharing between uh

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,320
malware reversal but nowadays is really

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,840
a core element in uh in the css

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,240
community

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,560
and um today we will share about what we

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,920
do as a specific

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,799
aspect for information sharing and i

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,280
think it's

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,680
the case for a lot of first members um

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,200
you are either facing

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,560
operation center so i think

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,640
you might see a lot of familiar use

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,840
cases there

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,680
that may be something that you you you

49
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,240
are you are you can reuse actively

50
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,240
uh and maybe take some ideas there and

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,680
even share your idea with us that might

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,000
be

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,720
interesting and then later we will more

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,479
go into the generalizations

55
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,520
of the sharing communities especially on

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,240
the aspect

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,640
of a creative community or successful

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,000
ones

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and or you can at least bring people on

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,318
on a good level in the sharing community

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,560
and to share actively

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,480
in such kind of communities

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,239
so a little bit about uh

64
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,000
again what alex has mentioned what we do

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,920
as well for for us um

66
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,560
this is mainly the tool that we do our

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,080
day-to-day activities

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,599
this research so that means we have a

69
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,040
bunch of different activities that we're

70
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,760
going to see

71
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,000
to get a little brief introduction to

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,840
and again this is this harkens back to

73
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,040
what alex just said it's

74
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,879
it's very much what most of you will be

75
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,640
familiar with already

76
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,640
but besides uh being a user of it we're

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,239
also driving the development of it so

78
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,840
we're kind of sitting on both ends of

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,160
the

80
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,360
uh of defense in that regard so we

81
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,519
so at least the advantage for us is that

82
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,519
normally uh

83
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,280
going from complaint about something not

84
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,360
working to actually reaching

85
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,480
the person that is responsible for

86
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,360
fixing it

87
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,040
is as far as it's normally under

88
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,120
non-covet situations as far as a slap

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,680
can go

90
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,800
so it's it's pretty easy to get

91
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,239
the people involved in fixing those

92
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,680
things with that said

93
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,959
one of the things that we're going to be

94
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,360
talking about as well is also that

95
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,800
that we're also interacting with a bunch

96
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,640
of different organizations out there and

97
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
a bunch of different communities

98
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,080
and for whom the information sharing

99
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,040
aspect of the entire thing is very

100
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,319
different based on what sort of

101
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,000
requirements and restrictions they have

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,280
so we're going to see a little bit about

103
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,400
that in the second half of this

104
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,959
presentation

105
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,319
so just for your information and to see

106
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,360
a bit the

107
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,799
volume of of those sharing communities

108
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,640
we operate various communities and we

109
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
wanted to share with you some of those

110
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,159
but i guess you can see the figures and

111
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,040
how large they are and all they are used

112
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,080
for example one of the

113
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,120
first one that we operated and

114
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,959
it for the private sector community so

115
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,120
initially it was a way for us to

116
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,200
um to have a kind of automatic way to

117
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
share information with our constituents

118
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,159
and this community became a kind of

119
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,239
default community that we operate and

120
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,519
that's something that we will talk maybe

121
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,599
later on on the building of sharing

122
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,798
communities but

123
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,959
um it showed to us that if we have a

124
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,560
kind of welcoming environment and a

125
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,918
critical sharing community for the

126
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,520
travel sector it was quite successful

127
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,479
because there

128
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,240
um we have as you know there's more than

129
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,680
4 000 users

130
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,919
actively sharing you see that they are

131
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,360
sharing a lot of reports so

132
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,120
if some of you want to join for example

133
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,880
a lot of

134
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,320
trade intelligence and information

135
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,440
sharing that is coming from that

136
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
community is shared through the first

137
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,919
instance and it's really a mix of

138
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:42,479
different

139
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,639
cultures from researcher um educations

140
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,479
uh private companies and so on so it's

141
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,000
really interesting to see that

142
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,320
this community is very active and this

143
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,759
diversity is like

144
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,440
one of the most interesting aspects

145
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,199
there it's really bringing a lot of

146
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,639
different people in different field of

147
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,680
activities

148
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,000
starting to share very different reports

149
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,759
and so on that this one is interesting

150
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,280
for us because it's a kind of

151
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,320
i would say a experimental playground

152
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,960
we get a lot of uh different sector

153
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,520
there

154
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,840
and giving you a lot of idea for us for

155
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,840
improving earthquake reviews

156
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,000
then we operate a dedicated one for the

157
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,440
csf community this one is

158
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,759
for the national governmental center

159
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,360
it's really a tighter community so it's

160
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,000
more like

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,039
the hyper focus on new zealand response

162
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,919
and things like that and this one is

163
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:30,800
basically

164
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,479
connected to other communities like the

165
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,160
private sector community where

166
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,039
information is shared too this one is

167
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,800
more tight but it's very interesting

168
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,000
because uh

169
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
when people are really dedicated to some

170
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,199
specific activities and specific

171
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,479
analysis

172
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,639
they are producing very good reports uh

173
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,400
very good regions and so on and that's

174
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,600
another interesting interesting use case

175
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,360
so besides that there are a bunch of

176
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,000
different other organizations on

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
whose we have we're basically doing the

178
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,440
hosting and we're helping to operate

179
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,720
uh communities um

180
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
obviously we are quite involved with

181
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,639
anything related to financial sector

182
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,440
since uh luxembourg is kind of known for

183
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,199
that so we're kind of a hot spot for

184
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,800
financial sector organizations in

185
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,720
general uh so

186
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,039
we're helping uh with the operation of

187
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,880
several private sector communities out

188
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,600
there

189
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,639
including national ones international

190
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,120
ones

191
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,880
ones related to certain

192
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,840
pre-existing groupings that are sharing

193
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,360
information and so on

194
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,280
and the information sharing and what's

195
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,199
what makes these sort of organizations

196
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,560
and communities interesting

197
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,960
is not only on the level of the typical

198
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,840
uh

199
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,360
threat indicators that we're dealing

200
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,199
with as a csert

201
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,360
but also a lot of the information gets

202
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,720
shared on

203
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,960
mule account information and all sorts

204
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,800
of fraudster information

205
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,840
between the different banks besides that

206
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,240
we're also involved with some other

207
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,680
similar sectoral

208
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,080
communities such as the gsm sector and

209
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,039
so on

210
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,319
uh but the interesting thing between

211
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,840
these different communities and an

212
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,440
effort that we have for a while is we're

213
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,880
trying to basically bridge these

214
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,240
different communities out there and we

215
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,000
highly encourage everyone also here

216
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,560
in the participants to to reach out to

217
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,160
cross-sectoral sharing

218
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,720
efforts in general uh because one of the

219
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,919
things that we're going to be talking

220
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,080
about that later on in uh

221
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,360
in this segment uh

222
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,479
is that we're trying to to at least

223
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,720
get information about different attacker

224
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,599
techniques

225
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,199
to be shared between these different

226
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,440
communities very often what we're seeing

227
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,599
is that the sectoral sharing is already

228
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,440
working really well for certain sectors

229
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,800
so there are a lot of very well

230
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,240
established groups that are

231
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,080
have active sharing where the those

232
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,360
initial inhibitions of

233
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
information exchange have already been

234
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,280
uh solved

235
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,560
but one of the things that we're still

236
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,400
missing is basically any

237
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,080
form of bridging between these different

238
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,840
communities so we're trying to build

239
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,680
something there

240
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,280
we will see a little bit about what sort

241
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,599
of efforts we have and what sort of

242
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,199
outcomes we're expecting from this and

243
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,879
what sort of issues we're trying to

244
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,639
to solve with with cross-sectorial

245
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,039
sharing

246
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,599
um in addition to that and that's linked

247
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,599
to what we mentioned yesterday about

248
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,800
contextualization

249
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,120
uh we are we are i was a strong

250
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,560
supporter of

251
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,720
having contextual information and more

252
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,639
complete reports and and things that can

253
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,199
be

254
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,879
used to better classify information and

255
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,680
at least one of the most successful

256
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,240
uh uh contextualization that we've seen

257
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,679
so far is the attack

258
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,919
models um which has been done by mike

259
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,599
say um this one is

260
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,399
super interesting because we we think

261
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,240
that this one is really helping

262
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,160
uh analyst cesar sansone to really

263
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,000
gather information use it and make it

264
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,240
useful for automatic system and so on

265
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,160
and at the same time uh

266
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,000
provide a lot of insight about what's

267
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,040
going on with the techniques of the

268
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,320
attacker and so on

269
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,959
so um at the same times we this one is

270
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,160
not really a community

271
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,000
per se for sharing there is more

272
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,279
community for

273
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,200
bringing along a lot of people on this

274
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,519
and we we co-started an initiative for

275
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,720
attack community

276
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,480
uh which is an attacker you community

277
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,399
where we have a meeting earlier due

278
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,839
in june and the there was

279
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,279
all there is more like to show the use

280
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,040
case of all people are using

281
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,000
the attack model to model attackers

282
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,560
share such kind of information

283
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,480
and it's really a i would say

284
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,800
nice on the iron man to standardize all

285
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,160
the ttp

286
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,040
that i use and so on and to normalize

287
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,480
what people are doing there

288
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,880
and to make it more consistent across

289
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,600
the different

290
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,560
sharing communities so the attack

291
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,519
community workshop

292
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,440
is really something that people are

293
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
bringing about what they are doing

294
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,760
and share with others for example based

295
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,959
on the attack models

296
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,720
many organizations like for example one

297
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,480
in the telecom sector bring a complete

298
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:56,880
new

299
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,959
attack model like uh directly in that

300
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,800
community so it was really interesting

301
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,600
to extend all people can contextualize

302
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,240
information

303
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,959
and that's why we are trying to support

304
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,399
such kind of initiative

305
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,279
to contextualize more information that

306
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:11,920
we share in

307
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,640
sharing community

308
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,800
so and this is going back a little bit

309
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,440
to what was already mentioned uh

310
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,720
we have a bunch of these different

311
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
communities that we're either directly

312
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,160
involved with or just tensioned with

313
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,279
supporting

314
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,600
that are really specialized on certain

315
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,720
topical sharing

316
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,399
so what alex has just mentioned for

317
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,399
example uh with the attack

318
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,120
community the outcome of of basically

319
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
those alternate models

320
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,720
is how these different communities also

321
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,640
operate uh partially so for example when

322
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,160
it comes to the

323
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,000
gsma community uh you

324
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,079
you basically get the output of uh of

325
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,760
those additional contextualization

326
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,399
frameworks uh also involved in there

327
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,000
uh so we're basically also involved in

328
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,120
these various different communities

329
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,240
obviously we're also

330
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,000
involved in first authorized community

331
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,959
so we're helping with the uh

332
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,399
operations of of the instance used there

333
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,680
but besides that there are a bunch of

334
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,519
other communities that we're involved

335
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,560
with we're also

336
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,200
trying to to help organizations and try

337
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,240
to run

338
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,440
cyber exercises with the help of miss so

339
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,240
currently uh for example there is a

340
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,959
large exercise running organized by nato

341
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,240
called dark shields

342
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,959
there is also a yearly exercise done by

343
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,560
anissa and a bunch of different other

344
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,000
exercises out there where we're

345
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,079
supporting with uh with infrastructure

346
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,800
okay so no the thing is if i we want to

347
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,480
look at the sharing aspect another thing

348
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,040
that

349
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,079
i wanted to mention today and if sharing

350
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:44,720
was kind of

351
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,160
educated at the early beginning but

352
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,760
nowadays what we see that

353
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,399
if you do incidental response it's not a

354
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,800
uh

355
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,399
it's a single person activity is really

356
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,040
something that is a team a teamwork

357
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,839
and what we have seen is is really

358
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,279
sharing

359
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,200
itself can be really used in a different

360
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,320
aspect of the sphere

361
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,360
so what we try to do in this

362
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,880
presentation is to

363
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,920
split the traditional i would say a

364
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,200
thesis activity in four different

365
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,560
types and we will talk about the sharing

366
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,160
aspect for each of these

367
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,800
services like the core activity that you

368
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,000
have as a species

369
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,920
the ones that are more proactive when

370
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,360
you reach out to the constituency and

371
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,200
turn advanced services and even

372
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,279
some specific community that you want to

373
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,120
use to support your

374
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,639
associate activity so your insurance

375
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,440
responsibilities and you'll see that

376
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,399
this sharing activity itself is really

377
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,839
supporting what you do in a day-to-day

378
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,800
basis i mean

379
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,240
in in 2010 for example um people are

380
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,839
like doing their incident

381
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,079
nearly alone nowadays for example for

382
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,000
around somewhere case it's not uncommon

383
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,720
for us to work on like with the victims

384
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,079
and and four or five different

385
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:56,959
organizations

386
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,040
at the same time like infinite responder

387
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,959
from private organization

388
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,600
other circulatory researchers antivirus

389
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,480
vendors

390
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,279
and and others on the single case so

391
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,440
you'll see that sharing is really a core

392
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,040
element in the activity of the

393
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,680
of the fifth year

394
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,000
maybe i can i can continue on that one

395
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,959
yeah so the thing is um what is really

396
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,839
the core service even on on on

397
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,800
this one and where do we use mists there

398
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,639
and and one of the things that we have

399
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,720
seen is a lot of information that the

400
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,680
structure in mist

401
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,760
is acting for us as a kind of interest

402
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,639
storage for the incident response data

403
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,199
so when we deal with incidents we need

404
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,800
to structure the information that we are

405
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,240
collecting

406
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,920
or we are dealing with it on a

407
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,360
day-to-day basis

408
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,279
and we need a kind of internal storage

409
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,279
that we can use and share afterwards so

410
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,880
that's why we are really using it as a

411
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,680
safer

412
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,079
mist as an internal storage so it's not

413
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,079
uncommon for example to

414
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,000
create a mist event like we did

415
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,240
yesterday for specific incidents that we

416
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,600
only share with us

417
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,440
and when the thing is coming to take i

418
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,000
would say a kind of sense or we can

419
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,440
start to understand what we are talking

420
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,199
about and what kind of incident we have

421
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,560
in front of us

422
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,000
we start to share information that's

423
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,760
really the thing that is

424
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,600
interesting for us it's really the same

425
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,320
workflow that we create or support the

426
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
incident missed and at the same time we

427
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,720
derive the specific indicators for the

428
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,920
incident response

429
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,880
and for example using the extended event

430
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,440
that we

431
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,760
we showed yesterday it's exactly that

432
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,600
you can for example create a specific

433
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,199
event which is like i would say the core

434
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,880
element that you are

435
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,959
using for doing your incident response

436
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,800
and all out of that

437
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,880
you generate a new missed event which is

438
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,079
more clear more

439
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,240
clean when you share information with

440
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,680
your partners we for example do that

441
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,760
with the css network in europe

442
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,360
or at some point when we have

443
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,560
interesting stuff to share with our

444
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,199
colleagues

445
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,959
at european level we just take the

446
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,040
information and share it back

447
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,800
another thing that is interesting too is

448
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,079
um the correlation of data and

449
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,000
we had a kind of shortcomings in a lot

450
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,560
of tools that we were using as a circle

451
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,720
for example a ticketing system a lot of

452
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
ticketing systems are working great but

453
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,160
they don't do automatic correlations and

454
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,199
that was like

455
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,120
we commonly missed for example that we

456
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,199
already work on similar cases that six

457
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,720
months before one year before because

458
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,240
one of our quality did the work

459
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,639
or it was a partner doing it but i think

460
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,399
the correlation missed automatically was

461
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,600
for us to kind of quick way to find out

462
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,880
okay we know about it

463
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,560
we already did work on that case because

464
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,480
it's some special indicator

465
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,720
things that the attacker left which

466
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,480
basically acted as a kind of correlating

467
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,920
data point for us and we

468
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,000
were able to find back okay that's an

469
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,040
existing

470
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,680
case obviously the thing that we want to

471
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,800
do is all the

472
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,600
enrichment expansion directly in your

473
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,839
incident response process

474
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,240
and in this we can do it automatically

475
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,680
so

476
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,959
in some of the two that we were using

477
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,320
previously it was difficult so that's

478
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,519
why we move

479
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,079
um the uh the enrichment aspect into

480
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,519
misdirection

481
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,120
another thing that is quite interesting

482
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,120
and this one is a very nice effect

483
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,680
of creating a sharing community when you

484
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,360
bring people on board

485
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,040
on your missed instance you start to

486
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,440
have a community of users in groups

487
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,800
where you can really collaborate with

488
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,199
insulin response and

489
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,360
you need to reach a kind of critical

490
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,399
mass if you

491
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,639
have skeptical math you can start work

492
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,800
on it and collaborate on it so as an

493
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,000
example

494
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,759
it means you have sharing groups so it's

495
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,000
not uncommon for example to start when

496
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,839
we know already that some users are only

497
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:32,399
lift

498
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,000
to create a specific sharing group that

499
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,639
is adopt only for this incident

500
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,839
and we use that as a way to coordinate

501
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:40,800
and collaborate

502
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,639
with the partners not only for the

503
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,800
incident itself but for practical stuff

504
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,680
like

505
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,480
inventory of incidences acquired during

506
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,959
the internal response a specific

507
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,040
takedown notification that we did during

508
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,560
the incident and things like that

509
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,800
so we can really coordinate everything

510
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,839
within misp

511
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,759
for a lot of the activities and for

512
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,920
example we have even integrations with

513
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,480
stir and mix together so we can still

514
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,520
maintain the

515
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,199
kind of interactions where people have

516
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,679
no misaccess and they are using emails

517
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,599
at the same time and continuing your

518
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,799
investigation inside

519
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,000
and tightly we have an integration with

520
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,959
ayla as the project so it's quite

521
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:19,919
advanced too so

522
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,760
nowadays what we do is we have a full

523
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,240
process where we do work pre-analysis

524
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,319
for example detection of leak on i don't

525
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,319
know github facebook whatever or you

526
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,360
name it

527
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,400
and then we generate this event and we

528
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,960
share it back in our community so

529
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,240
we tend to move a lot of our tools and

530
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,320
to connect our tools into this kind of

531
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,919
of workflow

532
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,039
by using mistp as a way to correlate and

533
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,640
collect all this information and share

534
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,679
it back

535
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,280
to our specific partners

536
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,120
yep perhaps something that you will most

537
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,160
likely interact with

538
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,919
with what we do with in the broader

539
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,000
community is what we call a proactive

540
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
services so this includes

541
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,200
a lot of the things that we also share

542
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,679
out of the wider community out there

543
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,559
a lot of what what we do basically is so

544
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,919
what alexander has already mentioned

545
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,600
basically

546
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,440
derive information from our day-to-day

547
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
activities instant response and so on

548
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,880
and share those with the community but

549
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,240
we're also doing a lot of

550
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,559
contextualizing of internal and external

551
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,520
data as well

552
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,120
so it means very often you will see for

553
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,520
example osun reports and reports going

554
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,799
from third parties

555
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,480
further enriched by us and shared out

556
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,919
the community so

557
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,600
one of the things that also is of great

558
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,520
value to us and it's also a part of our

559
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,880
mandate

560
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,679
is to also have a more usable data set

561
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,840
of information

562
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,080
both for our correlation needs as well

563
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,679
as basically to be able to inform our

564
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,840
constituency

565
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,919
so part of this effort is really taking

566
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,919
those reports doing additional research

567
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,520
additional lookups enrichment of the

568
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,080
data

569
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,919
and further contextualizing it and then

570
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,799
sharing it after the community

571
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,120
apart from that uh a lot of the data

572
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,160
that we share out is

573
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
obviously also coming from us so not all

574
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,280
synth reports but

575
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,400
our own uh reversing behavioral analysis

576
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,559
as well as our own instant response

577
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,000
outputs

578
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,679
we're also running a bunch of different

579
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,200
ways of collecting information from

580
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,400
different sources

581
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,320
so this is more raw data that we use for

582
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,440
those above mentioned steps

583
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,600
to produce data that can be shared for

584
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,640
example

585
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,760
we do our own sandboxing for a lot of

586
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,240
the

587
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,600
different sources so that means our

588
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
constituency can for example upload

589
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,720
uh samples to be checked

590
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,280
on the service that we have we basically

591
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,240
run uh

592
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,120
spamtraps handle and sensor network that

593
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,720
allows us to gather information if

594
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,240
anyone's interested in an open source

595
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,440
sensor network by the way we have

596
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,679
another project called d4

597
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,440
so so that that one is is quite handy

598
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,799
if you're building something like this

599
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,000
yourself and you want to stick to the

600
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,559
open

601
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,440
source world now in order to basically

602
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,120
take this different source and this is

603
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,640
something that i really encourage

604
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,159
everyone that is thinking of of

605
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,600
automating a lot of these different

606
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,360
tasks of these collection tasks in their

607
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,559
organization

608
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,080
what you can do with misbend what we

609
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,600
ourselves do as well is

610
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,200
run different missed instances for the

611
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,799
different collection needs

612
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,240
just uh inbulk collect the data from

613
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,360
these different sources

614
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,760
encode them in mis let your automatic

615
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,520
conversion scripts create the data for

616
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,080
you

617
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,880
and basically um interact with it as a

618
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,240
background source for

619
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,080
uh pulling in information whenever

620
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,760
something becomes relevant

621
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,120
it means if you have an incident if

622
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,559
you're an ongoing investigation and

623
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,080
you're seeing correlations to

624
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,679
the data in one of these collection

625
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,840
instances that you're running internally

626
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,280
then pull it over to your operational

627
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,360
instance and infuse it into your ongoing

628
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,640
activity it will basically

629
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,919
bootstrap the entire process for you so

630
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,440
we do that ourselves as well we build

631
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
this internal mis clouds

632
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,760
that involve several mis instances that

633
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,000
are interconnected with each other

634
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,520
we basically uh also also make these

635
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,640
individual collect

636
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,039
collection instances run using a set of

637
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,240
different tools

638
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,480
so i mentioned sandboxing before for

639
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,600
example if you're using

640
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,840
cuckoo there are versions of cuckoo with

641
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,360
direct music integration

642
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,039
it allows you to directly push the data

643
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,520
to miss for the spam

644
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,919
collection we're using it to an in-house

645
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,679
build tool set called mail to miss which

646
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,360
is also on our github page if you're

647
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,240
interested

648
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,720
it allows you to just act as a spam

649
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,000
trapped or

650
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,080
a full mail server collect the mails and

651
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,120
just generate events out of them if

652
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,760
you're

653
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,240
thinking of building uh situational

654
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,440
awareness tools out of

655
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,520
all this data are collected and we have

656
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,600
this uh additional miss dashboard tool

657
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,679
that you can run side by side with mis

658
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,440
this allows you to geolocate information

659
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,360
monitor trends build statistics and so

660
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,600
on

661
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,320
yeah it's something that you actively

662
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,880
use at circle for for a specific reason

663
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,039
you know luxembourg

664
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,440
a foreign and it's not uncommon for

665
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,480
example to have

666
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,159
a lot of hosting in the surroundings

667
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,720
like in belgium germany or france

668
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,520
and then based on that we were able to

669
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,159
look

670
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,080
geographically as specific attacks or

671
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,679
things that are going into a specific

672
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,240
area

673
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,360
and so on so um i i really advise you to

674
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,080
have a look at the

675
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,120
dashboard uh external component um which

676
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,200
is using the zero mq feed and uh the pop

677
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,440
stop it's really a nice way to see how

678
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,080
you can

679
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,039
extend and and really a situational

680
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,320
awareness uh

681
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,440
portal easily okay and then there is

682
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,559
something else that

683
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,919
we we start to use more myths for is

684
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,600
it's really supporting some advanced

685
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,039
services um

686
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,960
one of those is the forensic analysis

687
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,240
aspect

688
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,520
we extended in the past year with

689
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,159
many objects for digital forensics so

690
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,360
nowadays

691
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,360
people are actively using myths for

692
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,720
forensic analysis and especially to

693
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,919
conduct and at least document

694
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,480
all their analysis they do in enemies

695
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,799
for enemies instance

696
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,480
we have this kind of of no strong

697
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,919
collaboration with law enforcement on

698
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,360
different projects where

699
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,120
people are using this not only for

700
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,640
showing the indicators but really the

701
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,400
evidence themselves

702
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,480
the analysis the output the reports of

703
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,559
the analysis and so on so that's

704
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,840
really solving some kind of things that

705
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,679
are growing over time

706
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,280
we have a pretty large set of missed

707
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,080
objects therefore for forensic analysis

708
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,640
but more are coming over the the next

709
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,520
month

710
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,280
another thing that is interesting too we

711
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,200
have seen a lot of isaac

712
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,360
and organization using myths to share

713
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,159
information about generally

714
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,720
especially to have specific way of

715
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,440
sharing

716
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,080
a sensitive vulnerability for specific

717
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,799
equipment

718
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,360
infrastructure software and so on so

719
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:45,840
they were

720
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,919
really using mist as a way to

721
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,600
co-actively share

722
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,120
new vulnerabilities we have seen

723
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,360
some organization using it for different

724
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,679
things like for example for coordinating

725
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:58,080
with

726
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,679
vendor notifications so they

727
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,960
they do some kind of rent teaming

728
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,039
fuzzing whatever on specific software

729
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,279
component they find vulnerabilities

730
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,600
they are encoded in missed the vendor

731
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,679
have access to the missed instance

732
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,159
can coordinate with the reporter

733
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,760
directly information

734
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
and finally do the notification if they

735
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,840
do any notifications so it's really

736
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,600
an interesting way of sharing

737
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,120
information there

738
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,360
so it's this kind of organization for

739
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,039
example what they are doing too

740
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,400
uh is to um

741
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,240
share information about the penetration

742
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,840
testing result too

743
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,600
so it's giving a lot of way of

744
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,360
sharing information too so nowadays we

745
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,559
have seen a missed used in various use

746
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,760
cases and

747
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,000
the sharing of vulnerabilities is

748
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,679
increasing

749
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,240
nowadays

750
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,279
you want me to continue i can take it

751
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,720
so basically uh also a lot of what we do

752
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,640
is also facilitate the information

753
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,000
sharing and the

754
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,320
entire process of instant response for

755
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,080
others it's very often what we're doing

756
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,840
is we're helping organizations

757
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,559
to fulfill their needs and environment

758
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,120
in order

759
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,200
for reporting so we're involved with

760
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,880
some organizations and communities for

761
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,679
example when it comes to their uh

762
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,720
nist reporting uh so so we're helping

763
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,400
with that a little bit as well

764
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,520
we're also uh acting as

765
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,559
a third party very often uh in uh

766
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,240
in the incident response phase so when

767
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,159
there's a private uh organization

768
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,679
involved doing instant response

769
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,880
uh and for example law enforcement we'll

770
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,960
also very often involved in the process

771
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,880
and helping uh helping out with the

772
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,320
resolution in those cases uh

773
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,880
we basically uh facilitate the

774
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,880
collaboration through miss windows cases

775
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,480
and we involve all the parties that are

776
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,240
involved in instant response

777
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,320
and we communicate through myths that we

778
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,440
collaborate through especially findings

779
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,480
we're also doing a quite a bit and this

780
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,919
is something that that

781
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,840
kind of popped up ad hoc for us over the

782
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,279
years initially

783
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,960
when we started out with miss one of the

784
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,640
things that we required organizations to

785
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,400
do before they shared any information is

786
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,919
to make sure that the information is

787
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,679
actually useful for the community

788
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,360
but one of the things that we notice

789
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,520
over time especially once we had

790
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,360
in our constituency organizations

791
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,279
involved that didn't have the maturity

792
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,960
or didn't have the capacity

793
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,600
to run research on on the

794
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,440
incidents that they were facing was that

795
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,679
they were basically asking for help

796
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,600
and asking for the support of the

797
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,920
community in order to

798
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,960
[Music]

799
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,320
to figure out what they were dealing

800
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
with so this is what we call pre-sharing

801
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,720
of information so that means that

802
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,799
for example an organization very often

803
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,000
sees a malicious

804
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,559
file that's popped up in there in their

805
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,600
network

806
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,120
for example they received the mail that

807
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,880
uh an update in the mail

808
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,919
that there is an unusual way uh shared

809
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,440
with them and in those cases what they

810
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,960
would do is they would start a certain

811
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
event in a miss community

812
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,559
they would say we've received this we

813
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,000
have no clue what this is can anyone

814
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,440
help us with it

815
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,880
so this is something that we also are

816
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,799
there for to basically uh

817
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,840
act uh as an organizer for for a large

818
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,760
community like that where organizations

819
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,440
can ask for help with that

820
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,440
three of you will have borders or

821
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
reversers that are sitting

822
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,840
in their offices analyzing the 53rd

823
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,159
spear phishing email attachment of the

824
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:30,960
day

825
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,480
and they want to see something different

826
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,200
simply and they jump on it and

827
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,080
and provide some some feedback uh so

828
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,120
nowadays we have

829
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,399
um a taxonomy miss that allows you to

830
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,559
define these different requests and ask

831
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,320
for help ask for further analysis

832
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,600
describe what sort of an

833
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,000
er of uh what scope the analysis should

834
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,360
be so if you're looking for memory

835
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,960
forensics and so on

836
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,840
and to ask for that help as well another

837
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,279
thing that uh

838
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,799
that quite often happens in in this

839
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,480
communities and that we

840
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,279
we act as a central uh figure four very

841
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:03,679
often

842
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,919
is the pseudo-anonymized sharing so very

843
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,679
often organizations want to share with

844
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,360
the community want to receive feedback

845
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,960
on what they're seeing

846
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,320
but they do not want their names

847
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,760
attached to it so what happens this is

848
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,120
the thing that we talked about yesterday

849
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,799
with the entire delegated

850
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,600
publishing process we often act as the

851
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,919
organization that takes over data that

852
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,919
that gets delegated to us and release it

853
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,120
under our name

854
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,399
and then we basically bear the

855
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,080
responsibility and the visibility for

856
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,600
the data so

857
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,120
so if anyone wants to stay anonymous

858
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,440
they can use us for that

859
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,760
on top of that basically there are a

860
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,880
bunch of different

861
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,640
ways of sharing information a bunch of

862
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,799
different needs in different communities

863
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,720
one of the things that we try to do is

864
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,320
we try to help these other communities

865
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,039
uh to

866
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,360
map their data to miss to be able to

867
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,480
build those structures

868
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,080
those objects that we talked about the

869
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,679
other day

870
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,760
to be able to share information that is

871
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,880
unusual for this

872
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,279
by default so that means for example the

873
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,120
entire mule account information sharing

874
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,039
border control information sharing we

875
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,240
even had

876
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,399
information sharing about radar

877
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,080
waveforms which was a

878
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,200
little bit out of our depth but

879
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,600
sometimes we get

880
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,279
communities reaching out to us simply to

881
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,520
help them refine their processes and

882
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,440
information sharing

883
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,799
so if you have some some

884
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
yeah if you have some good example of

885
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,600
thing that you want to

886
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
to share or for example you have some

887
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,960
new data model that you want to see miss

888
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,279
don't hesitate to reach out to us and

889
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,279
we will extend immediately

890
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,600
okay just one thing and that's little

891
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,880
bit too much about that

892
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,799
today but this one is quite important

893
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,720
because we we have seen that

894
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,559
a lot of the success of sharing

895
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,799
communities depends about the uh

896
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,799
i would say legal compliance of sharing

897
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,399
information um

898
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,200
so we did a pretty extensive work uh

899
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,279
within the the framework of the staff

900
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,480
project uh

901
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,360
projects at european level in europe um

902
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,480
regarding the use

903
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,000
of the legal framework as a

904
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,360
kind of way to promote

905
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,440
information sharing instead of basically

906
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,840
seeing this as a kind of

907
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,640
limitation factor so everything we did

908
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,520
on that area

909
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,520
is public so it's open source document

910
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,760
we have a complete report on that

911
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,120
and what we have seen is the gdpr itself

912
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,399
which can be sometimes seen as a kind of

913
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,080
limitation factor for sharing

914
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,520
information

915
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,279
it's not always the case you have some

916
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,039
argumentation there in the gdp

917
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,039
which allow you to share information

918
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,520
especially when you protect

919
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,360
assets which containing for example

920
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,039
personal information or specific

921
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,360
categories of information

922
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,480
so we designed uh

923
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,559
myths to support gdp and at the same

924
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,840
time we were

925
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,240
looking at the legal framework to make

926
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,399
it a supportive argument so

927
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,080
if someone in your team is doing the

928
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,760
legal review and so on i really advise

929
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,880
you to have a look at

930
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,120
what is in that area on the compliance

931
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,039
page of this project

932
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,240
we did some documents there

933
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,159
and it's really helping when you

934
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,679
initiate or start

935
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,799
or bootstrap a new community

936
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,480
to have already that settled because you

937
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,840
are not alone and they are already

938
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,679
existing sharing communities that are

939
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,679
um taking that on on this problem so we

940
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,200
need everything is public

941
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,440
also the criminal public we uh we did

942
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,679
the complaint documents for various

943
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,360
legal framework and this might be

944
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,799
extended with a different one that will

945
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,360
come

946
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,158
at a later stage

947
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,760
so so basically let's talk a little bit

948
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,440
about what we hinted on

949
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,000
before why do we do all of this and why

950
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,039
do we try to

951
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,200
uh to have these inclusive communities

952
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,640
out there that go a little bit beyond

953
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,600
our

954
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,240
normal constituency so one of the things

955
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,480
that we noticed over the years was that

956
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,240
that even though the indicators might be

957
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,080
different that where and that we're

958
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,519
seeing in our different networks

959
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,039
depending on different organizations

960
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,559
sector and so on that we're

961
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,799
we're interacting with one of the things

962
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,720
that stays very common is basically the

963
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,919
change in trends

964
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,600
the change in attacker techniques that

965
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,360
are that we're facing and the change of

966
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,640
methodologies and

967
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,559
and the change of what sort of

968
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,240
protective measures we need to have in

969
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,720
place in order to protect ourselves

970
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,279
so one of the things that that we're

971
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:23,760
seeing

972
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,440
with a bunch of these communities we're

973
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,039
interacting with is is again they're

974
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,080
working really well

975
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,960
in their own silos uh so we're seeing

976
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,720
some really nice efforts

977
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,279
set up on national level sometimes on

978
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,519
sectorial level and so on

979
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,039
but but we still want to bring these

980
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,960
together to solve those

981
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,440
common threads that we're facing

982
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,159
so what we have seen the thing that is

983
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,200
quite interesting is

984
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,679
a lot of incidents are actually reusing

985
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,279
ttp across sectors and

986
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,440
i'll take an example that we we have

987
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,880
seen in recently um

988
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,360
this is coming back on a regular basis

989
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,640
for the this year

990
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,480
it's all those social engineering

991
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,919
attacks um

992
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,120
regarding for example um

993
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,840
either kovitz cases or see your fraud

994
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,080
back front and so forth up what we have

995
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,679
seen is and this this is quite

996
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:16,559
interesting

997
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,919
recently we saw that some sectors

998
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,320
have different kind of

999
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,919
characters and sounds they are using

1000
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,360
exactly the same techniques

1001
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,880
on both sides and if you share among

1002
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,360
those kind of sectors you can

1003
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,840
be prepared for what will come later on

1004
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,120
your sector

1005
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,159
and that's the thing that is really

1006
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,559
important so we have seen unlikely a lot

1007
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,480
of sharing communities that are really

1008
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,080
limiting their sectors and don't want to

1009
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,000
connect to other sectors

1010
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,480
it's not always useful i mean it's a lot

1011
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,760
of things are

1012
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,039
mixed we have seen for example some

1013
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,880
sharing communities that say okay we

1014
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,320
just want to have you know targeted

1015
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,919
attacks and techniques that are really

1016
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,440
high level

1017
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,279
but even high level techniques sometimes

1018
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,279
are using very low level techniques too

1019
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,880
uh and if you don't share this one you

1020
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,559
basically don't have for example the

1021
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,639
initial access of the attacker and you

1022
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,480
just have the letter access

1023
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,239
which is like we usually don't want to

1024
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,520
have later access you really want to

1025
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,199
detect at the first stage

1026
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,440
and such kind of threads are usually

1027
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,719
mixed so they are using different

1028
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,918
techniques

1029
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,079
things that can be correlated and so on

1030
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,839
might be of interest too so that's why

1031
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,399
the advantage of of really sharing

1032
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,280
almost

1033
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,320
among the different sectors is bringing

1034
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,599
new knowledge for you to act faster

1035
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,800
another thing is uh it's

1036
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,199
if you start to share among different

1037
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,560
communities and so on

1038
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,839
uh and in advance proactively you

1039
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,280
prepare yourself when you have a big

1040
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
incident so if you for example

1041
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,520
a big incident later on and you want to

1042
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,719
reach out to someone

1043
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,719
that would be the right person for the

1044
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,079
contact and fun if you

1045
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,239
don't have any first contact already

1046
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,160
sharing mechanism in place

1047
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,599
it will be tough because you have to

1048
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,520
re-establish traction and so on during

1049
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,359
the incident usually you don't want that

1050
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,280
so that's why having an active sharing

1051
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,400
community even

1052
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,480
when you are not facing incident is

1053
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,000
really preparing the grounds

1054
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,280
for incident response later on so the

1055
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,400
thing is

1056
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,320
more you share you'll see that and this

1057
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,760
is quite interesting too

1058
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,119
um when when you start with this kind of

1059
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,720
of people sharing you see the others

1060
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,760
that are following

1061
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,119
and that's really important because

1062
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,280
people are really caring of the others

1063
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,520
because if you're self-interested they

1064
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,119
are quite selfish too so they see that

1065
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,000
oh

1066
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,800
i'm sharing information and i could

1067
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,079
share that and and get

1068
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,000
some feedback from some others so you

1069
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,280
see that at the end

1070
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,839
you you spread the interest of sharing

1071
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:42,560
but

1072
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,720
even for your own interest because

1073
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,320
people might you know help you at some

1074
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,880
point in time

1075
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,240
so uh let's talk a little bit about

1076
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,760
setting up a community and how to get

1077
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,599
started so now we know why we want to do

1078
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,960
it but let's talk a bit about

1079
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,359
of the practical uh issues that we're

1080
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,960
going to be facing so we're so the

1081
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,720
second half of this talk is mostly going

1082
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,000
to be talking about

1083
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,520
our experiences with setting up

1084
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,040
communities some of the hurdles that we

1085
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,880
run into and some considerations for you

1086
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,320
as well if you're thinking of setting up

1087
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,000
a community yourself

1088
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,800
so first of all getting started is both

1089
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,320
easy and difficult at the same time

1090
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,839
meaning that getting the tooling in

1091
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:18,720
place

1092
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,880
is rather straightforward with what

1093
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,359
we've seen so

1094
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,520
deploying a mispencence spinning it up

1095
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,520
giving access to your peers

1096
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,000
not the most difficult task at the same

1097
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,280
time

1098
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,960
there is a more intimidating part of the

1099
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,400
entire process

1100
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
which is really dealing with the needs

1101
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,680
and requirements of your

1102
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,400
community so communities that just

1103
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,040
exists

1104
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,520
for the sake of existing basically and

1105
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,960
to have a checkbox that you have a

1106
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,400
sharing community

1107
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,960
usually don't work out and you need to

1108
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,760
understand

1109
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,599
needs of the different organizations

1110
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:52,839
that you're dealing with the needs of

1111
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,960
different

1112
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,560
groups that are subgroup

1113
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,040
below your group basically so that you

1114
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,880
you can provide some value to them as

1115
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,440
well

1116
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,000
one of the things to consider early on

1117
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,520
is that no matter

1118
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,599
how focused your community is you are

1119
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,119
going to be dealing with a diverse set

1120
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,320
of people

1121
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,000
that means diverse in a sense that

1122
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,359
you're going to have different types of

1123
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,400
organizations

1124
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,920
different work cultures different uh

1125
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,440
scopes all together of what they're

1126
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,640
interested in as well as

1127
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,400
different maturity levels for different

1128
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,960
organizations if you only cater to what

1129
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,640
your own needs are basically when you're

1130
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,200
produced

1131
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
when you're starting out the community

1132
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,320
then you're going to be

1133
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,920
probably the only one interested in the

1134
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
outcome of the entire thing which is not

1135
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
great for

1136
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,920
an inclusive community so the most

1137
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,760
important part and the toughest part in

1138
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,280
the entire process is

1139
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,040
understanding what sort of challenges

1140
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
your constituency is facing

1141
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,640
and to build the rules and the uh

1142
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,560
and the uh setups in terms of

1143
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,640
uh vocabulary is used and so on in your

1144
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,320
community and guidelines

1145
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,680
uh based on on the common needs of the

1146
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,040
of that constituency

1147
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,000
um just just a complimentary thing based

1148
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,960
on the questions

1149
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,200
for some so someone was mentioning to

1150
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,880
what degree are threads

1151
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,200
truly sectorial and to what degree rttp

1152
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,040
commands can you elaborate on the value

1153
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,240
of specialized

1154
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,480
cyber communities it's a very good

1155
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,599
question

1156
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,359
it's it's really depending on the

1157
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,200
sectors but

1158
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,359
i can take some example that i've seen

1159
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,680
and in different sector activities

1160
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,160
i remember once so this nizak for the

1161
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,280
industrial sector

1162
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,680
chemical sector they were sharing

1163
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,200
information about the specific conductor

1164
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,000
which uh okay was targeting them and

1165
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,040
they were

1166
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,880
basically abusing uh specific

1167
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,079
vulnerabilities

1168
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,320
uh from from microsoft in a very

1169
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,920
specific use case there

1170
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,520
um and um what we what we have seen is

1171
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,560
uh

1172
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,920
if this specialized uh technique that

1173
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,680
the attacker was using for the chemical

1174
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,640
sector

1175
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,680
was reused by another transactor uh

1176
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,440
because those two products were sharing

1177
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,240
the information

1178
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,240
and the technical tools so for example

1179
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,680
you you know that you have

1180
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,599
already some some group for example from

1181
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,520
china that are

1182
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,400
actively working on different sectors

1183
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:22,720
but

1184
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,760
among them they are trading

1185
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,040
tools and techniques and the only way to

1186
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,520
see that

1187
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,920
is to basically have this kind of uh

1188
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,880
sharing of uh

1189
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,119
information between the two and uh it

1190
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,480
was kind of a discovery for them because

1191
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,760
they were like thinking that okay the

1192
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,359
chemical sector are you know this kind

1193
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,040
of targeted group and they

1194
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,760
they might only be uh for them but at

1195
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,440
the end

1196
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,839
those groups are from were targeting

1197
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:48,880
with the same

1198
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,599
techniques so i mean there are a lot of

1199
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,720
common ttp

1200
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,839
share some are i will

1201
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,079
make sense i mean some connections

1202
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:58,880
techniques and

1203
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,599
tooling and sauna are actively used by

1204
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,280
different with different groups you

1205
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,880
you see that immediately i mean if you

1206
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,480
see for example a vulnerability popping

1207
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,839
up on microsoft exchange

1208
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,839
you see many people scanning for it and

1209
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,839
they are all using the same tools

1210
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,400
but the purpose at the end is completely

1211
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,200
different

1212
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,440
nevertheless if you are on the edge and

1213
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,280
of this very specific

1214
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,720
group or community sharing the

1215
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,200
information this can easily percolate

1216
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,720
with the others because okay we have

1217
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,359
seen that

1218
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,599
very advanced attacker starting to use

1219
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,119
the techniques and you know that in the

1220
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,160
next two weeks

1221
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,240
it will be at least leaked or shared

1222
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,520
with other members

1223
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,920
so that that's why the the sharing of

1224
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,200
such kind of techniques are

1225
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,280
make a lot of sense and

1226
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,000
i mean the degree of tcp come on is

1227
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,760
difficult to calculate but

1228
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,800
for what i've seen in the past they are

1229
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,520
a lot better

1230
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,520
they are common i mean i think i haven't

1231
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,720
seen that much

1232
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,240
unique ptp for specific productors

1233
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,400
and usually when it's the case it's very

1234
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,599
specialized

1235
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,560
characters very advanced and usually

1236
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,040
they are

1237
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,400
using a very specific group so sharing

1238
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,760
at least the one that are the most

1239
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,160
common is already covering a large

1240
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,839
percentage of the attack scenario that

1241
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,839
you can have on your infrastructure so

1242
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,359
i would say that it makes a lot of sense

1243
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,599
between sector activities

1244
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,640
to share common common ttps among the

1245
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,839
different sectors and it's

1246
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,480
really a quick question but um we can

1247
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,319
even talk later about this this topic

1248
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,000
and i think the question was was

1249
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,480
really good yeah and and also one of the

1250
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,000
things that maybe might be interesting

1251
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,240
as well to to take into account here is

1252
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,760
that most of the time you're going to

1253
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,760
obviously give a different preference to

1254
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,680
data coming from your own software for

1255
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,560
example

1256
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,960
or from our own geographic location and

1257
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,160
so on we

1258
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,200
we usually also talk about like

1259
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,680
having a high level value evaluation of

1260
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,960
the data sources that you have and

1261
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,839
obviously the

1262
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,359
the most important value that you're

1263
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,040
going to be dealing with is

1264
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,720
is basically attacks that are targeting

1265
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,240
your organization already

1266
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,319
or targeting your direct peers and so on

1267
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,920
but with that said what alexa has talked

1268
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,720
about about

1269
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,079
the new attacker techniques popping up

1270
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:06,720
and then

1271
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,359
really calculating to other communities

1272
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,640
is something that we're actually

1273
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,400
monitoring and seeing if you want to

1274
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,000
have a good exercise

1275
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,760
on that one of the things that that you

1276
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,280
can do as well is

1277
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,599
uh just connect to a community like a

1278
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,000
private sector community

1279
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,839
and have a look and ask those questions

1280
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,280
from the system like

1281
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,880
show me the attack techniques used

1282
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,400
that were shared by this list of

1283
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,960
organizations that i know belongs to a

1284
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,720
certain sector or to a certain

1285
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,520
geographic

1286
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,160
location and then overlay that over time

1287
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,000
with how they evolved so if you're

1288
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,599
interested in doing that research we

1289
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,680
have the data set for that

1290
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,640
and a lot of the other business

1291
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,240
communities out there perhaps your own

1292
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,160
already has it has this information as

1293
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:48,960
well

1294
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,440
uh so it's just a matter of of really

1295
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,119
tracing back those changes between the

1296
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,880
different communities

1297
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,119
yeah sometimes the challenge is for some

1298
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,280
of the ttp models like attack and so on

1299
00:42:59,280 --> 00:42:59,839
it's maybe

1300
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,960
superb world so you can have for example

1301
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,119
a technique that encompass multiple

1302
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,079
techniques

1303
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,760
so that's why they recently split with

1304
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,200
some techniques

1305
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,599
but if here for example at some point in

1306
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,319
times a technique that is not described

1307
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,200
in attack in which you can even fork the

1308
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,560
technique for example on

1309
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,280
attack and add some new some new

1310
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,880
techniques so

1311
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,400
and that we have seen that more and more

1312
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,000
often but sometimes you

1313
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,480
might see new things that are maybe

1314
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,119
looks like

1315
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,160
unique for you but that's later

1316
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,079
they become part of the attack framework

1317
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,240
and being cooperative but

1318
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,480
sometimes you want to share that earlier

1319
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,640
than the attack model being

1320
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,280
updated so now going back to the

1321
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,040
creation of sharing communities and this

1322
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,400
one is uh

1323
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,240
interesting if you start a community

1324
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,319
from scratch you are in an interesting

1325
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,200
unique position

1326
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,680
where you can basically said the best

1327
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,960
practices in the world

1328
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,400
there's something to really not

1329
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,880
underestimate the capability of the

1330
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,839
human mind to

1331
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,640
imitate what the others are doing and uh

1332
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,680
what we have seen for a lot of

1333
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,960
communities like

1334
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,640
if you set the standard high at the

1335
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,880
early beginning

1336
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,400
you have people that

1337
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,880
are increasing the quality of their

1338
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,560
content and so on so we have seen for

1339
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,359
example

1340
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,200
a community coming from just a flat

1341
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,480
editorialist

1342
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,720
up to very highly contextual information

1343
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,560
and so just because one organization in

1344
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,359
that group

1345
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,440
decided to make it better and that's

1346
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,800
really really interesting there

1347
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,680
now if you want to start running a

1348
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,119
sharing community

1349
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,680
using myst uh how do you do you start so

1350
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,560
you have different

1351
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,640
model of um of hosting those kind of uh

1352
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,079
community so one of the things that you

1353
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,200
you can do is uh

1354
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,440
and that's i think that as a first

1355
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,680
member you can already directly do it

1356
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,480
with a misfortune instance you can

1357
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,079
connect two to one

1358
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,760
an existing one and get access to that

1359
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,200
data

1360
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,119
another model and that's when you start

1361
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,640
to you want to

1362
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,880
to operate your own instance and usually

1363
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,800
we really recommend that aspect because

1364
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,280
it's

1365
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,880
for privacy reason for example you don't

1366
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,319
want for example to leak your queries

1367
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,079
what you're searching for and so on

1368
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,160
hosting your own instance is really a

1369
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,119
good approach

1370
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,800
and then you can connect to one or

1371
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,160
multiple miss power and you want to

1372
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,680
connect the first instance

1373
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,079
the circular one the one from gsma and

1374
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:24,960
so on that's

1375
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,319
thing that you can do automatically and

1376
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,400
it's just a matter of very simple

1377
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,000
configuration so

1378
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,319
um it's it's it's one way of doing it

1379
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:33,040
another thing

1380
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,720
is which is common too it's like you

1381
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,079
become part of

1382
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,920
a specific isaac or sectorial community

1383
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
uh so you have those kind of different

1384
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,520
models and you can

1385
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,960
with myths you can really switch from

1386
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,960
one model to the other very early

1387
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,359
as you want the thing that you you have

1388
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:50,160
to take

1389
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,839
care if you want to set up your misting

1390
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,280
stand is obviously

1391
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,079
uh you have to plan it for the future so

1392
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:57,760
you have to estimate requirements we'll

1393
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,960
talk about that

1394
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,520
later or today or about the uh

1395
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,440
requirement for miss pinstance

1396
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,680
but that's i mean it's it's it's

1397
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,599
classical system but as long as you have

1398
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,280
a view of what you want to have in your

1399
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,079
system

1400
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,760
if you have millions of events per day

1401
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,400
that's another story or anything like uh

1402
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,200
i mean analysis on a daily basis for

1403
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,319
example

1404
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,079
another thing that we have seen that's

1405
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,800
super important is really the

1406
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,480
deciding very early on common

1407
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,800
vocabularies and i remember

1408
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,319
an experience we are there an

1409
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,480
interesting one so we were participating

1410
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,000
in the creation

1411
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,960
in isaac in germany and um we had one of

1412
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,520
the first

1413
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,240
very first early meeting there so it was

1414
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,319
like different industries

1415
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,119
different private companies um

1416
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,960
discussing about what to share

1417
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,200
and so on and then we have seen a kind

1418
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,160
of

1419
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,920
tensions between different organizations

1420
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,440
because somewhere interested to share

1421
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,880
for example data from

1422
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,560
honeypot and you have those

1423
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,760
organizations willing to share

1424
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,280
information just about

1425
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,359
specific targeted attacks and and both

1426
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,640
organizations were like okay

1427
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,640
i want to share that the other half of

1428
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,400
that information

1429
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,400
and i remember the coordinator of that

1430
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,040
group as a very good move he said okay

1431
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,480
that's fine as long as you share but

1432
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,079
what i'm i want

1433
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,880
is that you properly liberalize and type

1434
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,000
this information

1435
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
with a proper vocabulary and i think

1436
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,599
that was a very good move

1437
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,520
because by doing that you don't respect

1438
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,680
people to share information you just

1439
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,240
force them to have proper labels and

1440
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,599
then

1441
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,520
any of the members of that community can

1442
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,920
decide if they want to get information

1443
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,680
or not because based on the vocabularies

1444
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,559
and the label

1445
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,240
they can filter out the information

1446
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,599
that's really important

1447
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,000
so this kind of of deciding from the

1448
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,119
early stage

1449
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,680
which vocabulary that you will use will

1450
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,040
uh

1451
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,880
basically set up the ground of more

1452
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,160
sharing but

1453
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,160
a more i would say granular approach on

1454
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,079
the filtering aspect and then

1455
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,599
organization can just share it because

1456
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,000
they really want information

1457
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,359
and what we have seen that's quite

1458
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,119
interesting too is some isaac

1459
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,319
are offering services through myths

1460
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:05,760
for example you have the module for

1461
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,839
expansion services and they were for

1462
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,119
example paying

1463
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,000
a specific fee providers or they were

1464
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,200
paying for

1465
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,440
expansion services and they were

1466
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,480
offering that

1467
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,359
to uh through their missed instance so

1468
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:20,880
you see that you have different models

1469
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,599
and you have even

1470
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:22,800
people that are running different

1471
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,960
business case or business model around

1472
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,920
misp

1473
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,680
to share to share information

1474
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:34,400
so with all that said uh the most

1475
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,920
important things that we notice when

1476
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,599
you're when you've already decided on

1477
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,200
the scoping of how you're going to

1478
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,440
start out with me and when you're

1479
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,280
already decided on vocabularies to use

1480
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,559
and so on when you're done with this

1481
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:45,680
initial phase

1482
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,440
and you start out with the community it

1483
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,920
still can fail at that point very easily

1484
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,720
the reason for that is starting out uh

1485
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,400
in a sharing community without having

1486
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,760
the background knowledge and without

1487
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,200
having the experience of

1488
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,760
what what is expected by the group is

1489
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,359
really intimidating so

1490
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,440
we've seen so we've seen a particular

1491
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,960
community for example

1492
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,800
that was set up by a large organization

1493
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,240
inviting their partners to share

1494
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,760
information with them

1495
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,000
where they did not provide any data in

1496
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,960
the beginning

1497
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,680
and the result was that after their one

1498
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,520
year pilot they ended up i think with

1499
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,200
six events all together

1500
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,599
shared by a community of uh 20-something

1501
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,359
organizations

1502
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,599
so one of the things that we saw works

1503
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:26,720
really well against this

1504
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,359
is leading by example so that means that

1505
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,880
all of the organizations that you're

1506
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,960
going to be interacting with

1507
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,040
are going to be waiting for you to see

1508
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,319
what you are sharing

1509
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,000
to know what what they should be sharing

1510
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,680
back and to get an idea of what is

1511
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,440
expected really

1512
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,880
especially at the beginning when you're

1513
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,880
starting out taking the extra effort to

1514
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,599
providing

1515
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,400
more information and more work in the

1516
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,599
analysis process

1517
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,359
of what you provide than you would

1518
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,960
normally for in your day-to-day

1519
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,640
operations really pays off in the long

1520
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,520
term

1521
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,040
because you're you're setting the tone

1522
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,640
for the community you're setting the

1523
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,480
expectations for the community

1524
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,960
and you're also improving the processes

1525
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,839
of your peers

1526
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,440
so one of the things that that happens

1527
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,960
very often is

1528
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,200
with any community that starts out it's

1529
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,200
really a difference in maturity and in

1530
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,200
experience for different organizations

1531
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,480
also very often with the

1532
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,920
time effort that they can invest in

1533
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,480
in the sharing aspect so things to

1534
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,760
consider is

1535
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,520
consider what sort of information should

1536
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,960
be shared and share that type of

1537
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,800
information so that the organization see

1538
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,800
that

1539
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,559
over contextualize your information

1540
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,480
especially at the start so

1541
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,960
even if something is not in your normal

1542
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,760
use case

1543
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,440
and you have information about the

1544
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,960
source of the information

1545
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,200
about how to best make use of it include

1546
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,800
that as well

1547
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,720
include why you consider this

1548
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,319
information useful

1549
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:49,280
so analyst comments along with the data

1550
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,760
especially at the start are super useful

1551
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,000
because that really gives a little bit

1552
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,599
of insight of how you ended up with

1553
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:56,559
conclusions

1554
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,160
why you made the decisions that you made

1555
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,480
in the end also and this is something

1556
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,480
that is super underrated and

1557
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,319
and very few communities actually do

1558
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,240
this actively but when it is done it

1559
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,440
really helps

1560
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,079
is also describe how you arrive at

1561
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,920
conclusions in more concrete ways for

1562
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,119
example what rules it

1563
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,359
use if you've built your own scripts for

1564
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:16,480
detection

1565
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,000
for something that uh that you're

1566
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,559
describing include those scripts as well

1567
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,400
even if they're half-baked they're going

1568
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,079
to be a good starting point for other

1569
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,200
organizations at the very worst case if

1570
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,160
you do this

1571
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,680
you you're going to be ending up raising

1572
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,680
the capabilities of your constituency so

1573
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,680
even if you you fail in your

1574
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,319
quest to get your community to start

1575
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,079
sharing useful information

1576
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,359
at least we've made them a little bit

1577
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,280
more secure so that's the worst possible

1578
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,800
outcome that they came out of this if

1579
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,119
you put this effort in

1580
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,839
let's try please

1581
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,559
yeah in addition to that maybe for the

1582
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,880
tools and uh i have a good example

1583
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,079
this one was interesting um very often

1584
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,280
we have this kind of

1585
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,400
of wave of financial malware where they

1586
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,359
do encryption sophistication and so on

1587
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,839
and we have seen some use case and uh

1588
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:06,720
really uh

1589
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,440
joined on russia on that where uh when

1590
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,480
we have analysts

1591
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,200
sharing the tools they use you see an

1592
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,800
automatic increase of capabilities of

1593
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,119
everyone and they can't find more

1594
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:18,960
it was the case for some financial

1595
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,200
malware where someone found a way to

1596
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,880
extract the configuration automatically

1597
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,119
instead of doing it manually with ida

1598
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,920
and he was sharing the python script

1599
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,599
along with the missed event

1600
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,119
and then you see all the other suddenly

1601
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:33,040
the oldest organization doing it

1602
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,559
because they got the capabilities they

1603
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,079
got the tools and they were able to do

1604
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,920
it and when the configuration will

1605
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,960
share more more fast so that's quite

1606
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,839
quite interesting there

1607
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:51,040
okay so what kind of valuable

1608
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,440
information and that again

1609
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,160
is very interesting um we participated

1610
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,040
to some sharing

1611
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,119
communities and we were helping them to

1612
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,880
set up their communities

1613
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,200
and we have seen two kinds of approach

1614
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,000
we have one

1615
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,640
kind of approach where they make a kind

1616
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,720
of contract in the contract they define

1617
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,240
a very strict view of what they share

1618
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,079
and we have other communities that are a

1619
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:15,839
bit more large and say okay

1620
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,880
um we basically trust our members of

1621
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,359
what they will share and so on and we

1622
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,680
open them to share a lot of information

1623
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,400
and

1624
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,000
what we have seen the most successful

1625
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,480
one are the

1626
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,960
communities that are embracing all of

1627
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,720
them so for example

1628
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,079
what they were sharing is a lot of

1629
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,359
information but some can even

1630
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,359
share very basic stuff what we have seen

1631
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,440
is some organization where

1632
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,319
sharing existing reports for example

1633
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,520
they take

1634
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,680
orifin report from vendors and they make

1635
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,280
it passable

1636
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,920
and structure and missed to make them

1637
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,559
usable

1638
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,720
into automatic tools and that's quite

1639
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,599
important too

1640
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,040
so they were not really producing

1641
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,520
reports per se but they were

1642
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,839
parsing analyzing them reviewing them

1643
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,119
qualifying them

1644
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,920
and structuring them into misp to

1645
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,599
provide information this is kind of

1646
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,160
an interesting one so you can really do

1647
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,760
that myspecifically designed for that

1648
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,640
for sharing

1649
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,040
reports structural information and so on

1650
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,400
um

1651
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,119
so that's uh that's one of the way uh

1652
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,079
thing that you are

1653
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:22,160
quite interesting to it um we have seen

1654
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,480
an organization for example that never

1655
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,400
really contributed direct support and

1656
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,160
stuff like that but they were

1657
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,400
validating or doing enhancement on

1658
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,359
existing data

1659
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,079
so they were proposing changes um

1660
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,599
typographic error and so on and that's

1661
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,040
quite an interesting

1662
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,599
approach even if some organizations have

1663
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,599
problems to contribute directly

1664
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,160
but can't contribute or ameliorate some

1665
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,520
report

1666
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,240
they were doing it and and some for

1667
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,920
example we're just doing validation

1668
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,680
like changing false false false positive

1669
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,040
things like that and so on and even even

1670
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,720
if you have for example low capabilities

1671
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,000
organizations in your

1672
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,240
group that are sharing information for

1673
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,680
asking for support

1674
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,920
this is very interesting andreas

1675
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,599
mentioned the case where some people are

1676
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,280
asking for support

1677
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,640
through this kind of community is

1678
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,799
interesting because it's a source of

1679
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:13,920
potential

1680
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,079
new incident we have seen cases where

1681
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,559
people are okay just dropping a binary

1682
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,319
oh i've seen that one it was dropped in

1683
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,240
the temp directory what is it it looks

1684
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,280
like suspicious but

1685
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,040
you know i don't know what to do with it

1686
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,559
and then when you have a community with

1687
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,640
like 4000 users and

1688
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,280
all four of them are a malware reversal

1689
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,480
it's for them a

1690
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,559
very interesting thing to get new uh to

1691
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:35,599
get the hand on

1692
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,400
new new malware so what we really think

1693
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:38,880
that is

1694
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,119
interesting is really to to support and

1695
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,040
embrace all kind of data

1696
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,599
uh because it sometimes doesn't make

1697
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,200
sense to share the information it might

1698
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,400
come and

1699
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,480
we had the case for example even for us

1700
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,079
we haven't the mistake

1701
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,680
um at some point in time we had those

1702
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,920
kind of

1703
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,200
ransom emails and they were asking you

1704
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,160
to pay a

1705
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,839
handsome two bitcoins and we were like

1706
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:04,319
okay so that spam is not so interesting

1707
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,240
but at one point one of our constituents

1708
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,359
was like

1709
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,520
actively storing all the bitcoin

1710
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,280
addresses into misspent sound

1711
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,960
and it was quite useful at the end

1712
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,720
because we were able to run out

1713
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,440
a complete economic analysis of what the

1714
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,280
attacker gained from such kind of ransom

1715
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,200
by just looking at the blockchain

1716
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,599
so we were like okay yes it makes sense

1717
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,040
where those bitcoin addresses

1718
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,960
as we have a large set of those we were

1719
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,559
able to do some statistics about

1720
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,200
okay what is the benefits and the uh

1721
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,040
economical approach from the attacker on

1722
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,000
this so that's kind of

1723
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,839
interesting and you see that sometimes

1724
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,680
data that are not so interesting at the

1725
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,799
very beginning

1726
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:42,400
might become interesting later on

1727
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:46,160
yeah so uh one of the biggest questions

1728
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:46,880
that uh

1729
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,319
that comes up very often when you're

1730
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:49,920
building a community is first of all it

1731
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,960
takes a long time

1732
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,000
to get in uh reading engagement from the

1733
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,520
organizations

1734
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,839
uh so because the question that we often

1735
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,440
get asked is how do you deal with

1736
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,799
organizations that are

1737
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,599
just there to leach so to say and from

1738
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:04,160
our own

1739
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,440
statistics that we run on our

1740
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,000
communities about 30 percent of our

1741
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,839
organizations in our largest community

1742
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,000
are actually sharing information now

1743
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,760
this might seem like a small number but

1744
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,280
this is actually a really high number

1745
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,799
for a sharing community so in our case

1746
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,599
this means

1747
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:21,040
that out of around 2000 organizations

1748
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,559
we have around 700 or 600 that are

1749
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:26,480
sharing information actively

1750
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,480
now with that said to arrive to this

1751
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,760
point it took us about

1752
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,400
nine to ten years so it's a very very

1753
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,240
long process to get there

1754
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,319
and because of this obviously one of one

1755
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,400
of the conclusions that some communities

1756
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,559
jump to very early on is okay we need to

1757
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:41,280
set up

1758
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,079
some hard incentive to encourage the

1759
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:45,520
organizations to share

1760
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,119
and we've had some discussions in

1761
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,839
organization that ended up

1762
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:52,480
setting up their national community with

1763
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,480
the requirement of sharing information

1764
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,920
and it really didn't work out for them

1765
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,119
in the long term so what they

1766
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,119
had was they had quotas you need to

1767
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,640
reach your monthly quota

1768
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,160
in order to stay in the community or

1769
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,760
else you get kicked out

1770
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,920
now this is super dangerous in general

1771
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,599
we're basically one of the things that

1772
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,200
we noticed with that was

1773
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,720
the moment you have those requirements

1774
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,400
you have one of two effects

1775
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,960
uh as an outcome one of them is that you

1776
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,440
lose

1777
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,359
potentially valuable members of your

1778
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:18,559
community

1779
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,319
and the other is that you're going to be

1780
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,240
flooded by junk just to meet the quota

1781
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:22,960
so if you

1782
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,960
ever use any peer-to-peer networks this

1783
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,160
is a pretty common

1784
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,480
thing that will that is a side effect of

1785
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,839
this

1786
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,400
so one of the things that we also

1787
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,079
noticed was that basically um

1788
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,200
uh by allowing organizations to just use

1789
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,000
the data

1790
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,319
um and to just be involved in the

1791
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:44,480
sharing without actively producing data

1792
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,720
we had we saw several effects come out

1793
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,839
of that

1794
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:49,280
first of all we basically saw

1795
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,280
organizations grow over time

1796
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,200
so when we're when we're dealing with

1797
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,200
the maturity and the

1798
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,119
acceptance of information sharing within

1799
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:59,280
organizational culture this is something

1800
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,200
that shifts over time

1801
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,359
i think our average time to share the

1802
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,440
first event per organization was around

1803
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,640
eight nine months

1804
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,200
so we did some statistics on that too so

1805
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:09,920
this this is

1806
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,520
again something that takes time so if

1807
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,280
you kick them out early on or if you set

1808
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,119
crazy requirements that discourage them

1809
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,880
from sharing in the long term

1810
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,799
and then you then you might lose those

1811
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,760
organizations in the first place

1812
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,880
the other thing is that even if

1813
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,480
organizations don't end up sharing

1814
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,040
information it is still of value to you

1815
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,640
because if they see something that is

1816
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,480
troublesome for them for example if

1817
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,079
they're getting false positives from

1818
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:33,599
your reports if you're getting data that

1819
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,280
they cannot directly use for whatever

1820
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,160
reason

1821
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,079
and because they consider it junk they

1822
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:39,440
will start a

1823
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,280
discussion with you they will start to

1824
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,200
improve your data and to give feedback

1825
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,960
on why it's not working for them

1826
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,640
and that is valuable information sharing

1827
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,879
too

1828
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,960
next time

1829
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,400
sorry you have an equivalent oh but i

1830
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,280
can take it if you want

1831
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,480
can you hear me no okay so

1832
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,240
uh basically we've talked a lot about

1833
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,680
what doesn't work and

1834
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,160
and most of the things that that uh this

1835
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,319
ended up failing for us

1836
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,920
now but let's talk a little bit about

1837
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,599
what actually does work and what we've

1838
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:18,319
seen

1839
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:21,920
actually working in terms of encouraging

1840
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,359
uh information sharing first of all

1841
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,200
relying on organic growth and and just

1842
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,040
being patient is the number one factor

1843
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,319
that works

1844
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:33,119
second helping your your constituency to

1845
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,160
increase their own

1846
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,119
capabilities by providing them with

1847
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:38,160
guidance

1848
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,079
setting up workshops every now and then

1849
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,640
that that helped them build on their own

1850
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,680
processes

1851
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,839
and also by simply describing how you do

1852
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:47,599
your work together with the information

1853
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:48,960
that you share

1854
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,760
can already lead to that now on top of

1855
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:52,160
that

1856
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,079
uh obviously uh whenever we're

1857
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,440
sharing information um

1858
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,000
we we have to also see the inherent

1859
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,599
value of what we share so we talked

1860
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,760
about the importance of information that

1861
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,680
targets us so the number one thing that

1862
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,440
we care about in general

1863
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,200
is any threat that is targeting my

1864
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,160
organization or my direct constituency

1865
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,319
now whenever we share information of our

1866
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:17,839
ongoing incidents

1867
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:21,040
our ongoing research we start getting

1868
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,319
feedback on that and

1869
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:25,839
alternate perspectives uh either be it

1870
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:28,240
small improvements a data set or

1871
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,760
complete different

1872
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,000
uh perspectives in terms of okay we've

1873
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,119
also seen this

1874
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:35,599
but for us the attacker used a different

1875
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:36,319
variation

1876
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:38,240
use different interest infrastructure

1877
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,079
points and so on so for example extended

1878
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,839
events are a great vehicle for

1879
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:44,960
providing such uh feedback whenever you

1880
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,640
get that that's the most valuable

1881
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,160
information you can get

1882
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,599
because that is really something that is

1883
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,359
targeting you and it is being improved

1884
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:52,960
by that i'm giving additional

1885
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,200
uh perspectives on that something else

1886
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,119
to consider is no matter how

1887
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,119
advanced your processes and your

1888
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,280
your capabilities are there is always

1889
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,720
going to be gaps in there that are

1890
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,319
filled by other organizations so we've

1891
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:07,359
seen very

1892
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,760
very advanced organizations that were

1893
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,480
doing their

1894
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,720
own research their own analysis that

1895
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,319
still lacked certain capabilities like

1896
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:14,960
memory and

1897
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,880
forensics and so on that basically

1898
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,400
provided additional perspectives

1899
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,920
additional data points to

1900
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,359
what they have already analyzed in their

1901
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:25,280
own premises so getting that feedback

1902
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,319
household

1903
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,079
now something else that really helps and

1904
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,240
this is more of the social interaction

1905
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:30,720
thing that

1906
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,079
that really helps with information

1907
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,520
sharing is we have to understand that a

1908
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,119
lot of the information sharing

1909
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:36,880
and the encoding of the information

1910
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,319
analysis

1911
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,559
analysis reports and so on that end up

1912
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,799
in the sharing community

1913
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:45,359
also involve a lot of personal incentive

1914
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:46,720
that means that a lot of

1915
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,839
researchers will go out of their way to

1916
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:51,760
to provide better reports for the

1917
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,280
community to provide better

1918
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,720
uh more timely reports and so on and so

1919
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:57,520
forth

1920
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,119
give credit where credit is too if

1921
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:00,799
you're seeing something that is useful

1922
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:01,520
to you

1923
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,520
just let the organization know about it

1924
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,039
okay this is something that we use we've

1925
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:05,920
also seen this

1926
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,839
provide sightings provide comments and

1927
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,119
so on

1928
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,640
now the worst thing that you can do is

1929
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,400
the opposite of that we've seen

1930
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,920
one community that tried to do that

1931
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,319
where they

1932
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,039
relabeled all data as their own you know

1933
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,920
in an effort

1934
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,559
to just anonymize data for their entire

1935
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,880
community without anyone asking for it

1936
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,520
it ended up in basically a situation

1937
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,280
where researchers were encoding their

1938
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,119
own name as file hashes and including

1939
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:32,799
those in the events

1940
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,480
don't do anything like that that will

1941
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,480
really discourage your community and it

1942
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,039
will

1943
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,160
wreck the willingness to share

1944
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:45,119
in very quick time

1945
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,319
thanks yeah

1946
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,960
so giving credit is really one of the

1947
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,559
key elements uh

1948
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,039
so we talked about that yesterday about

1949
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,039
the interaction and i think

1950
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,240
everyone everyone got it um it's it's

1951
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,599
still something that is

1952
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,799
tough uh with pandemic and so on it's

1953
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,960
even tougher nowadays

1954
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,359
but the social interaction so if if you

1955
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:10,559
have the ability to

1956
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:13,760
create a regular workshop conferences or

1957
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,599
even face-to-face meetings

1958
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,599
for your sharing communities make a lot

1959
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,200
of sense and we have seen a lot of

1960
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,240
successful ones

1961
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,960
that are built based on existing group

1962
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,720
that's easily interesting so for example

1963
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,680
for first

1964
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,920
this one is quite active because the

1965
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,440
first community is already existing and

1966
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,200
running for the past year

1967
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,880
so which is like i think a good

1968
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,720
incentive for us starting to communicate

1969
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,880
on that

1970
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,920
so um the thing that is interesting and

1971
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,440
that we have seen over time is

1972
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,760
um the contextualizing information and i

1973
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,760
think it's really one of our mantra

1974
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,480
we might repeat it like in the on on

1975
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,400
like four or five or even six light on

1976
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,119
that

1977
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,000
but it's it's really the synthetic we

1978
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,160
have seen this kind of

1979
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,000
things about technical information okay

1980
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,760
that's great um

1981
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,960
but the best if you can have really

1982
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,480
additional architectural information to

1983
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,039
this is really giving you a lot of help

1984
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:09,200
so the complete trade landscape would

1985
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,559
help so it could be

1986
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,359
a contextualization qualification of

1987
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:14,880
data and so on that that's

1988
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,240
why myspare like a significant number of

1989
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,680
taxonomy

1990
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,000
galaxies and so on use that it's really

1991
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,920
useful for that i mean for example

1992
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,400
uh we have a great galaxy for all the

1993
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,520
ransomwares

1994
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,440
uh and this one contains a lot of meta

1995
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,200
information about for example

1996
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,400
the ransomware notes uh details about

1997
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,559
the price of the transform and and and

1998
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,319
stuff like that the encryption news and

1999
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:38,799
so on

2000
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:40,000
so it's really giving you a lot of

2001
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,839
insight about it and and

2002
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:43,359
adding such kind of context-friendly

2003
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:45,359
information makes information more

2004
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:46,880
valuable not only for

2005
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,680
i mean people that will use for a

2006
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,440
protective tool and stuff like that but

2007
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,880
it will be useful for

2008
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,119
your team doing risk analysis

2009
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,240
evaluations

2010
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,359
regular report uh threat assessment

2011
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:01,520
and and and stuff like that because it's

2012
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,400
very important there

2013
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,839
so the thing that is interesting is

2014
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,760
if you are in the sharing communities

2015
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,039
classifying the information

2016
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,920
especially to tell why it's important

2017
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,119
for you because sometimes you are

2018
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:18,640
sharing technical information but you

2019
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,319
don't even know why it's

2020
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:23,359
useful and if you explain the context in

2021
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:23,760
which

2022
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,599
uh for example the source where you

2023
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,359
catch it

2024
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:29,200
why you are sharing because sometimes

2025
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,640
you can say that okay i'm sharing

2026
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,799
it because i'm missing for example we

2027
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:33,680
have a specific

2028
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,280
community for collaborative

2029
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,440
collaborations on on mist

2030
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,440
because sometimes you say okay i'm

2031
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,039
interested in sharing that because i

2032
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,960
want to create for example

2033
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,559
ids rules for such kind of patterns and

2034
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:48,480
this is this can be useful for you and

2035
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,960
others if you explain the context

2036
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,359
or why it's valuable for you it might

2037
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:55,280
help others and

2038
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,280
i remember a specific use case that we

2039
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,119
had taught sometimes ago

2040
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:01,440
we have been to a sharing committees and

2041
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,720
as a cert we were

2042
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,240
actively sharing analysis of memory

2043
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:10,240
life memory and one of the

2044
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,680
members of that community came back to

2045
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,359
us and said yeah but you know it's

2046
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:14,000
useless for

2047
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,160
us we don't know what to do with that

2048
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,160
and they had the point because they

2049
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,200
didn't know

2050
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,799
what we do with that kind of information

2051
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:22,640
like a pattern memory that we were

2052
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,720
searching for that pattern in memory

2053
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,319
and then what we discovered they were

2054
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:28,240
lacking the capabilities of analyzing

2055
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,680
memory thump

2056
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,720
and by doing so it is explaining what

2057
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,240
you will do with the data

2058
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,240
the result might help others to increase

2059
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,920
this capability so it's really important

2060
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,400
to

2061
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,920
to have this kind of contextualization

2062
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,319
so contextualization is not like

2063
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:44,880
we heard very often in some presentation

2064
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:45,520
and so on

2065
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,079
characters you know ttp and so but

2066
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:49,760
that's a small part you have a lot of

2067
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,559
things that are

2068
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,039
bound to what you do with information or

2069
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:54,079
you acquire it

2070
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:55,920
or you qualify it and so it's much

2071
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,839
broader than that so don't hesitate to

2072
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:00,160
to contextualize because again it might

2073
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,760
be useful for others

2074
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,920
um and then if it's contextualized

2075
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,760
it's helping the others to filter out

2076
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,119
the example in germany with the

2077
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,799
organization

2078
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:14,000
asking each member to label and pro use

2079
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:14,799
proper stacks

2080
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,880
is helping everyone to fill the role i

2081
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,238
just want this information because it's

2082
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,679
labeled with that and that and that

2083
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,000
which make a lot of sense so gonna

2084
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,198
estimate the power of tags and labels

2085
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:26,479
because it's really the thing that is

2086
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:29,040
helping you at the end to

2087
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,880
use and inject information into your

2088
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,279
system

2089
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,198
yeah we've already talked about this and

2090
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:40,080
this is really what alex just explained

2091
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,198
um one of the things that uh that you'll

2092
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:44,479
be doing quite a bit of

2093
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:46,319
when you're setting up communities is

2094
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,719
not only

2095
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,600
guiding the information sharing by

2096
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,040
leading by example

2097
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,719
but also the correct choice of

2098
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:56,238
vocabularies that make sense for the

2099
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:57,520
community so this going back to the

2100
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,198
example that alex mentioned

2101
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:02,158
in that german community where they

2102
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:03,120
ended up

2103
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,439
coming up with an own very simplistic

2104
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:07,920
vocabulary in order to do a first level

2105
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,920
uh assessment of the information how it

2106
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,279
is to be used

2107
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,279
uh so so a lot of the work as a

2108
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:14,880
community leader basically

2109
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,719
is going to be for you to to

2110
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,439
keep a sane set of vocabularies and

2111
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:23,920
perhaps manage your own vocabularies

2112
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,279
that the community is going to be using

2113
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,920
yeah we will talk about later today

2114
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,679
about how to customize your

2115
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:34,399
vocabulary and so on but we have seen a

2116
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,319
lot of organizations for example

2117
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:39,359
taking back their excel sheet with

2118
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:42,000
all their existing classifications and

2119
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,319
injecting it into and to miss by

2120
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,319
creating json files

2121
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:50,799
the thing that so you don't you just

2122
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,479
have the classification and so on but

2123
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:53,359
you have

2124
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,280
meta libraries of information and i was

2125
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,280
mentioning the ransomware galaxy

2126
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,520
that we maintain we maintain one with

2127
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,719
the thread actor

2128
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,960
this one is a challenging one especially

2129
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,320
the tradactor one uh

2130
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,000
you know that a lot of organizations

2131
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,159
have different way of naming things and

2132
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:09,120
so on

2133
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,159
um so we have a galaxy model something

2134
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:13,199
that is like

2135
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:15,760
synonyms uh helping others who have like

2136
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,800
different names

2137
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,480
and and stuff like that um but we we

2138
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,159
you can't really describe it into

2139
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:23,840
anything you like um

2140
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,679
so we make it customizable in mist so

2141
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,360
like that in the sharing community

2142
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,480
if you want to share very specific

2143
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,480
things with your sector like for example

2144
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,560
a methodology for additional preventive

2145
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,920
action

2146
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,520
i've seen for example some communities

2147
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,800
that are sharing information about

2148
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,560
physical prep

2149
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,840
so things that are against assets

2150
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,880
equipment that's really the physical one

2151
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,520
and they created really a galaxy for

2152
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,120
that based on might say attack

2153
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,760
but it's not myself actually based on on

2154
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,280
physical uh

2155
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,360
attacks on equipment infrastructure

2156
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:58,080
plans the target

2157
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,360
so again we we are really

2158
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,120
we are really welcome to extend this

2159
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,040
with a new

2160
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,880
new libraries or even extension of

2161
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,520
existing one

2162
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,400
you can have your own you can even fork

2163
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,000
for example the characters one so for

2164
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,480
example in the intelligence committee

2165
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,400
they are eager to reuse the character

2166
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,080
information that we have

2167
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,120
and they fork it so in if you can fork

2168
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,719
specific galaxy

2169
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:26,239
and they add their own product over

2170
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:27,760
there without sharing it back

2171
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,000
so like that they benefit they have a

2172
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,239
kind of interesting aspect of using

2173
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:35,520
the one that is public uh and there is

2174
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,520
one that is like only for the private

2175
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,520
use and which is like the mapping of the

2176
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,080
existing

2177
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,760
uh selector so that's something that we

2178
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,920
can share this an open question right

2179
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,760
now is there a catalog to have to decide

2180
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,440
which community are relevant

2181
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,320
do you know if there are any security

2182
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,480
policing the customer to use myths

2183
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,280
yes there's a catalogue of communities

2184
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,440
which is even part of mix

2185
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,480
is not exhaustive this one is a

2186
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,520
one that is on the sync action i think

2187
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,640
if i remember correctly

2188
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,640
where you have a list communities and

2189
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,679
there you can even

2190
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:12,400
request access so they might be relevant

2191
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,159
to you depending on the sector

2192
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:16,239
it's not an exhaustive list because

2193
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,719
everyone is this is there

2194
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:21,040
but don't hesitate to reach out with

2195
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,480
with your sectors and we

2196
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,560
can sometimes we know some of the

2197
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,920
communities and we can we can give you

2198
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,960
some details

2199
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,960
and if we know some security vendors

2200
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,880
encouraging customers to use myth

2201
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,800
uh i think an example which is quite

2202
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,239
interesting is devo

2203
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,880
so if uh record correctly devo is a

2204
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,159
us-based company doing

2205
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,640
kind of cloud services same as the cloud

2206
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,760
services

2207
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,800
and they actively use misp to share

2208
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,520
information between their

2209
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,800
users on infrastructure like that they

2210
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,760
can share about

2211
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,840
similar indicators so they like th

2212
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,600
there's a kind of benefit

2213
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,719
uh of using myths to share information

2214
01:12:58,719 --> 01:12:59,440
and so on

2215
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,000
there are many others that are for

2216
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
example proposing plugin extension

2217
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,040
to mist many feed vendors are providing

2218
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,920
feeds in the misformat which is uh which

2219
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:12,400
is

2220
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,080
a good point too because it's allowing

2221
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,520
them to

2222
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,440
an user to synchronize those lisp events

2223
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,400
in their organization and so on easily

2224
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,600
so

2225
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,920
yes for example we the thing that is

2226
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:26,880
quite interesting for

2227
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,840
for our approach myth is just a tool for

2228
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,040
us and

2229
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,360
we are really supporting organizations

2230
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,280
and and vendors and some integrating

2231
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,560
with other components um so we

2232
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,400
we do regular webinars for example with

2233
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,000
various vendors

2234
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,120
on how to interact with mist and

2235
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,880
there are specific products so we are we

2236
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,880
are well welcoming you have a tool stage

2237
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,239
on the mix project

2238
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:53,920
including a lot of those connections

2239
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:54,640
there

2240
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,600
but there are plenty of other vendors

2241
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,679
encouraging users to use this because

2242
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:01,600
it's for them an entry level i mean for

2243
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,840
example a vendor for fees or

2244
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,080
services i can mention far sides for

2245
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,239
example which is a passive dns vendor

2246
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,719
and if you have a small organization

2247
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:11,360
that

2248
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,480
doesn't want to to buy a complete

2249
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,760
full-fledged tip

2250
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,360
on the clothes and so on and they still

2251
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,880
want to have passive dns

2252
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,199
but they will run a mist and they will

2253
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,040
buy services from parkside for doing the

2254
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,719
passive dns for example so

2255
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:26,159
yes there are plenty of vendors doing

2256
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:27,920
that uh we welcome andy

2257
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,040
we have seen integration between

2258
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,920
miss and other tip that's quite cool too

2259
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:34,480
so that

2260
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,320
some people are very good at some

2261
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,760
specific uh

2262
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,360
activities and then they use

2263
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,800
mispositioning mechanism

2264
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,000
so that's a common way of doing that so

2265
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,880
indeed we have seen a lot of vendors

2266
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,800
encouraging you to use this

2267
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,360
yeah something else to mention there as

2268
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,000
well as

2269
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
we we've seen the uptake of the spin

2270
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,239
certain types of vendors

2271
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:59,040
quite more frequently than others for

2272
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,040
example av vendors are

2273
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,719
typically i think most of the major ones

2274
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:04,719
have misintegrations

2275
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:06,239
if you're looking at feed vendors most

2276
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,000
of the major fleet vendors indeed

2277
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,640
either provide data in this format or tr

2278
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,280
or provide

2279
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,000
tooling in order to ingest it in this

2280
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,120
format

2281
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,400
so there are some of these types of

2282
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,159
tools that where it's quite a natural

2283
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:20,800
choice

2284
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,239
so just reach out to your vendor and

2285
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,000
your provider and just ask how

2286
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,280
you can access it in this when they will

2287
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,040
probably have an answer for you

2288
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,960
yeah and if they don't and they don't

2289
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,159
exactly know what to do with this

2290
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:31,440
they're going to reach out to us and we

2291
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,719
can even help them

2292
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:39,040
for the integration if

2293
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,239
okay uh now we've talked plenty about

2294
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:44,000
this so i think we can skip this for now

2295
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,920
for the false positive uh

2296
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,360
handling uh yeah this is

2297
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,199
something else that is interesting and

2298
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:52,960
something that will come up quite a bit

2299
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,719
um uh as a question not necessarily this

2300
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:57,520
slide but we're

2301
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,560
we have been two slides from here um is

2302
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,679
basically the need

2303
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:04,800
to uh to work with different subgroups

2304
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,080
within your own

2305
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,920
group as well we we talked a little bit

2306
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,679
already about this differentiation with

2307
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:10,480
context for

2308
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,280
different types of use cases but there

2309
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,960
is something else to consider as well

2310
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,080
sometimes you're going to

2311
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,560
run into a question where the

2312
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:19,600
requirements of

2313
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,440
certain parts of your community are so

2314
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,360
widely different that even keeping them

2315
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,159
on the same

2316
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,719
uh platform or the same direct community

2317
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:28,400
doesn't make that much sense

2318
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,080
so for example we've seen a very

2319
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,520
interesting use case uh

2320
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,560
in a financial sector

2321
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,719
so it was a regional financial sector

2322
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,159
organization

2323
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,880
and that basically enabled information

2324
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,719
sharing for all the financial sectors

2325
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:45,040
uh in the region what they ended up

2326
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:45,920
doing was that

2327
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,239
they ended up with two separate layers

2328
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:49,840
of information sharing

2329
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,320
one community that was more vetted

2330
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,920
information so they

2331
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,600
were a little bit blown away by the

2332
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,440
amount of vetting that went into the

2333
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,120
data that was shared in there

2334
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,880
so they ended up with everything being a

2335
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,640
connected graph that was a requirement

2336
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,159
for all data being shared

2337
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:06,239
everything was highly contextualized and

2338
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:08,239
immediately operationally usable

2339
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:09,840
so they had one layer of information

2340
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,000
sharing where they had a miss community

2341
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,120
with something like 60 members

2342
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,120
where the sharing happened on that layer

2343
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,640
and they had a second layer for the

2344
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,480
organizations with more capabilities

2345
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,760
where they provided

2346
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,320
more of a pure raw feed of their

2347
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,280
ingestion

2348
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,080
so it means anything that that went into

2349
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,679
malicious activities or

2350
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:32,000
that detect us malicious activities they

2351
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
share their own indicators the raw

2352
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
data form from which they ended up

2353
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,600
producing those reports

2354
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,600
so they had initial sharing which was

2355
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,840
reaching their constituency faster

2356
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,760
but where data was uncategorized and

2357
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,360
more raw

2358
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,600
and then for the organizations which for

2359
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,440
example less maturity that needed help

2360
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,760
with deciding how they can use the data

2361
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,520
and they had the second layer where they

2362
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,840
included more of the

2363
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,000
information vetted information sharing

2364
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,520
so this is one way to manage

2365
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,280
sub-communities for example within your

2366
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,159
community

2367
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:04,239
on the other hand in in many cases this

2368
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:06,400
is not needed and what we end up doing

2369
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,640
is we end up creating communities within

2370
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,000
a single community

2371
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,080
so in those cases we use sharing groups

2372
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,480
for regular recurring sharings between

2373
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,520
different groups

2374
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,480
we've seen for example another community

2375
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:18,960
where

2376
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,719
the members of the community had

2377
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:22,000
different membership

2378
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,880
levels where different membership levels

2379
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,159
ended up with different

2380
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:29,280
data sets and they still

2381
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,960
use the same community there was common

2382
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,560
data being shared but there was data

2383
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,400
that was exclusive to certain parts of

2384
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,600
the community

2385
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,840
so whenever you're you're setting up

2386
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,520
your community you need to think about

2387
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,520
this how am i going to cluster data is

2388
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,120
everything visible to everyone by

2389
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,159
default

2390
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:45,920
is it something right where i want to

2391
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,880
encourage these subgroup creations

2392
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,480
do i perhaps want to really have a

2393
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,959
physical

2394
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,320
i separation between the two communities

2395
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,520
run two separate

2396
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,520
servers for the two communities perhaps

2397
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,000
have a semi-manual link of exchanging

2398
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,440
information between them

2399
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,040
we do that with some of our communities

2400
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,000
for example where we act as a safety net

2401
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,159
for broad information sharing so for

2402
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:11,520
example if someone in the military

2403
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,440
sector ends up sharing information

2404
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,360
it will not directly flow to the private

2405
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,480
sector for a

2406
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,560
community that we operate what happens

2407
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,640
instead is even if something is tlp

2408
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,400
white and shareable with everyone we do

2409
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,560
a second set of manual vetting on it

2410
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,239
to ensure that there was no accidental

2411
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:28,000
information leakage and so on

2412
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,239
so you might want to set up those uh

2413
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,560
rules as well within your community

2414
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,320
if you ever need any help with this and

2415
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,800
have questions about about how to how to

2416
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,440
actually put this into action let us

2417

know what then we can help you and walk

2418
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:43,679

so if you want to build your own

2421
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,919

supporting various organizations

2425
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,120
setting up their own sharing communities

2426
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,000
um

2427
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,560
things that are maybe of interest too if

2428
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,440
you want to

2429
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,360
to get in contact or join one of the

2430
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:14,880
communities who are paradon don't

2431
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,560
hesitate to reach out

2432
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,960
don't hesitate to check out the mystery

2433
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:19,840
first um

2434
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,280
if your first member you have access

2435
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,600
directly so you can uh benefit from from

2436
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,800
that mission instance

2437
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,320
uh if you have any questions regarding

2438
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,080
that instance orders don't hesitate to

2439
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,000
reach out to us we can we can we can

2440
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,520
help there

2441
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,520
a lot of our activities regarding mist

2442
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,520
especially uh announced and so on so

2443
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,719
take place on twitter

2444
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:40,159
on github and we have a kind of a

2445
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:43,360
constant chat channel on github where we

2446
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,120
we are talking with different users of

2447
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,560
myths about

2448
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,360
installation issue and and stuff like

2449
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,639
that

2450
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:54,000
okay so um the next session is a quick

2451
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,679
session about the deployment of myth

2452
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:59,199
um so that you you you can maybe

2453
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:01,280
make your decision when you install mist

2454
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,880
and what you you need to do so i will

2455
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:03,199
just

2456
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:07,678
switch the slide to this one

2457
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,440
in the meantime if you have any

2458
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,840
questions don't hesitate to use the zoom

2459
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,840
um

2460
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:19,199
application

2461
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,760
okay so someone is sharing an

2462
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:22,880
interesting project

2463
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,560
in brazil

2464
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:28,960
some i don't know that one so maybe

2465
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,320
there are

2466
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,639
so you have a lot of of cti community

2467
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:33,600
worldwide

2468
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,800
um so um and we know that

2469
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,960
in south america there are many users of

2470
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,120
me

2471
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:44,080
so that's uh maybe a good opportunity to

2472
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,040
have a look at that

2473
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:49,040
um so it's the same for

2474
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:53,199
okay same for other countries i mean

2475
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,920
we have seen some regional uh uh species

2476
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,220
using mist

2477
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:58,560
[Music]

2478
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,760
we have seen some um

2479
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,760
some national species populating

2480
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,600
millions for example the first them

2481
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,960
south americans are operating different

2482
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,159
mist instance

2483
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:14,320
um so it's it's quite uh quite common

2484
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,080
yeah maybe something and i just quickly

2485
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,000
replied there so if you were running a

2486
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,199
community like that so i

2487
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:22,320
i i i've only seen you guys on uh on

2488
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,239
twitter before uh

2489
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,760
but it would be interesting for your

2490
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,679
users perhaps as well uh we can include

2491
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:29,120
you in the default community list and

2492
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:29,840
miss

2493
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,639
so that uh that new installs of miss can

2494
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:34,000
directly ask access for

2495
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,520
uh from you from you folks by if you

2496
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,199
have a self-registration link enabled on

2497
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:40,400
your missport something like that so

2498
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,239
just reach out to us send us a mail

2499
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:43,840
and we can just uh add you to the

2500
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,520
default list if you describe the

2501
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,880
community there

2502
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:49,840
so yeah it's very interesting to have

2503
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,280
regional ones and especially for

2504
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,280
yourself i remember we have seen that

2505
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,800
some communities that are in a specific

2506
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,800
language for example to uh

2507
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,679
are being created and so we have this

2508
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:00,639
list

2509
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:04,080
the json files in in the miscourt system

2510
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,080
and everyone installing mysql has the

2511
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,000
list and then is this interesting

2512
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,760
richard and it's up to

2513
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,159
the organizer of the group to decide if

2514
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:13,920
they want to have this

2515
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:17,360
request being on board or not

2516
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,400
okay so miss deployment from some

2517
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:26,239
basic um guidelines

2518
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:29,920
yeah so so basically the idea behind

2519
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,719
this session is

2520
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:32,000
we're going to talk a little bit about

2521
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,920
some of the pitfalls so and this is the

2522
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,199
outcome of a lot of the previous

2523
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:36,639
trainings that we've done

2524
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:38,480
uh we end up with a lot of questions

2525
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,159
about okay what sort of system should i

2526
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:41,280
be installing on

2527
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,719
what sort of deployment options do i

2528
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:44,239
have with misp so we're going to talk a

2529
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:46,080
little bit about these different options

2530
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:48,080
some of the advantages disadvantages of

2531
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,199
some and some of uh

2532
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:50,800
and also explaining where we can best

2533
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,880
support you a lot of keep in mind that a

2534
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,639
lot of the deployment options that exist

2535
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:56,239
for miss don't come from us

2536
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:58,480
so obviously we can offer less support

2537
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,280
in the ones that we know less ourselves

2538
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,199
so we're going to talk about that as

2539
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:05,920
well quite a bit let's go

2540
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,639
so what are the deployment strategy for

2541
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:10,800
me so you have different one

2542
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,840
obviously misp is a

2543
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,840
an open source tool that you can install

2544
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,639
uh easily on a unix machine so we have a

2545
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:22,080
kind of one liner installation script so

2546
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,840
you can use that one and run it or you

2547
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,920
can just look at the manual installation

2548
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,360
and do a manual installation so it's

2549
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:28,800
basically setting up a

2550
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:32,239
micro db or mysql the apache server

2551
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:35,360
ready server and then you can install

2552
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,920
the dependencies and so on and on

2553
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,159
now on the other hand we are regularly

2554
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:42,639
generating

2555
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:46,719
gesture image in a visual box format

2556
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:50,880
and vmware format so you can download it

2557
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,800
it's solid it's one way to install a

2558
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,080
toon solo

2559
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,840
installment docker there are many of

2560
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,199
those

2561
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:01,679
the one that's i think well known and

2562
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:05,040
used is the one from the black seed

2563
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,520
in the next slide anyway okay then you

2564
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:08,400
have a

2565
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,920
different way to install mista it's an

2566
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,760
fpm maintained by switching and

2567
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,280
switzerland

2568
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,000
for installing a miss for fpm package

2569
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,600
version

2570
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,360
someone is maintaining a mixed cloud

2571
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,960
images for

2572
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,600
in this case it's amazon web services so

2573
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,199
the if they primary image id

2574
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:26,400
and then you can deploy the automatic

2575
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,159
tmsp instance i know a lot of

2576
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:28,800
organizations

2577
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,320
are doing that when they are on

2578
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:31,920
cloud-based services

2579
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,639
so don't forget miss this i would say a

2580
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:36,639
new trade regarding in-premises

2581
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:39,840
on cloud intel and so on it's up to you

2582
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,600
and your organization to decide

2583
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,960
where you want to host your system

2584
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,800
now which one you end up choosing from

2585
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,320
these will mostly depend on what you're

2586
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,320
used to anyway so if you're used to use

2587
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,840
running all your then by all

2588
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:54,080
organization

2589
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,000
use one of the docker installs so don't

2590
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,440
jump through groups of me having to

2591
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:58,560
maintain something that

2592
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,880
will just your burden on you going to

2593
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,480
the back to the docker options we would

2594
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,880
basically have several docker installers

2595
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,080
that are being maintained by the

2596
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,320
community so no no no these these are

2597
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:09,840
maintained directly by us

2598
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,600
and some are more actively maintained

2599
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,280
than others the one that

2600
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,960
as alex has mentioned that is probably

2601
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,400
the most commonly used and the most

2602
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,000
actively maintained is the one from cool

2603
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,520
asset

2604
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,800
so that one is rolling out updates

2605
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,639
about as fast as we are so the moment we

2606
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:26,000
do a release on this

2607
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
within six hours or so usually there is

2608
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,159
already a new docker image available

2609
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:31,040
with

2610
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,800
and the latest changes the interesting

2611
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,159
thing with that one is that one is

2612
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:35,840
really built to be an operational

2613
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,440
mispencence from the get-go

2614
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,040
so the once you deploy it you have very

2615
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:41,120
little to do from that point on to

2616
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,880
get up and running and to really have it

2617
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,440
operational

2618
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,440
there is one from xavier matthews that

2619
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,120
is very interesting that one more

2620
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:52,480
closely makes a virtual machine image so

2621
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,159
it goes a little bit against the normal

2622
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:55,679
docker

2623
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:57,520
concepts of separating everything into

2624
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:58,880
their own containers

2625
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,320
and it's kind of a single container

2626
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:05,600
setup via docker and the advantage of

2627
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,440
that is it's it's it's great

2628
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,199
if you want to have something up and

2629
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:10,560
running quickly something that you can

2630
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,560
modify the configure

2631
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,719
and something that is easy to maintain

2632
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:16,960
so

2633
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,639
obviously when it comes to debugging and

2634
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:21,199
so on having a very broad uh

2635
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:24,400
distributed docker landscape is tougher

2636
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,679
than a monolithic

2637
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:28,719
edge there's also one that is in

2638
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:30,639
concepts more closely related to the one

2639
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:31,199
from cool

2640
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,199
it's maintained by harvard security have

2641
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:34,400
a look at that one as well

2642
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,800
uh if you're making decisions which one

2643
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,199
to pick

2644
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:42,639
now the distribution part there are many

2645
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:43,040
ways

2646
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,239
of distribution so so as long as you

2647
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:47,600
have a unique base system

2648
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,000
you can have a myth but uh obviously you

2649
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,199
have one that we

2650
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:52,960
maintain tests and so on because we are

2651
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,400
using those uh

2652
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,480
so for us our preferred choice is

2653
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,760
obviously ubuntu

2654
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:01,600
uh lts 2004 is really

2655
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,280
the platform that you are actively using

2656
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,960
and testing on a regular basis

2657
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:08,800
uh 1804 will still work so that's um

2658
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,880
so if you if you have to choose a

2659
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,239
platform the thing is the one that you

2660
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:14,000
have to choose uh

2661
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,639
and if you have questions regarding this

2662
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:17,840
chat and so on

2663
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,520
uh we are usually more eager to support

2664
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:20,800
that one because we don't have all the

2665
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,880
setup from the other distribution

2666
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,199
to be able to answer you uh so if you're

2667
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:26,239
on the fast

2668
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:28,480
i would say fast response and reply from

2669
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,719
us uh using ubuntu one because we we

2670
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:32,080
don't know all the specialties of all

2671
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,440
the distributions

2672
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,360
we know some organizations forced to use

2673
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,280
centos or rather than surprise linux

2674
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:40,800
um centos for example uh has some issue

2675
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,320
on the operation because

2676
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:45,440
it's down to some specific specialty

2677
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,120
that uh might be uh

2678
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,239
uh an issue sent to us as uh

2679
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:53,360
some discussion about going away and

2680
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,440
so if you are able to consider other

2681
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:56,560
options like ubuntu

2682
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,800
move it so it's clear one of the

2683
01:28:58,800 --> 01:28:59,760
approach

2684
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,560
um so we have in the script that we have

2685
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,120
we have

2686
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,600
uh support for uh relevant surprising

2687
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,960
seven and eight i think

2688
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,920
uh it it knows it works but again it's

2689
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:10,560
well test

2690
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,960
it's not so so well tested compared to

2691
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,239
the ubuntu one

2692
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:18,000
um so uh and you might run into troubles

2693
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,040
when you have to want to

2694
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:21,600
the latest version of python and and

2695
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,880
stuff like that you have to

2696
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:26,080
put additional surfaces and so on um

2697
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:29,120
so again yes it works i

2698
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,800
i know some people for example that were

2699
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,600
able to install miss from the macos

2700
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,560
system it works but don't expect us to

2701
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:38,080
help you there because

2702
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:39,679
we don't have we cannot test all

2703
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:41,840
distribution existing in the world so

2704
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,639
if you have to pick one then to pick

2705
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:46,000
ubuntu and that will help

2706
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,440
everyone with that said um especially

2707
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,880
when it comes to reference users there

2708
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,719
is a huge community of misusers out

2709
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:53,199
there

2710
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:54,800
so normally the way it works is if there

2711
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,880
is a bug reported

2712
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,320
we either test it manually which means

2713
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,199
spinning up

2714
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:03,280
a new instance in the in that

2715
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:04,719
environment and so on

2716
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:06,639
or we rely basically on one of these

2717
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:08,239
organizations that are also active

2718
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:10,159
contributors to this to fix it

2719
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:12,560
now with ubuntu the biggest advantage is

2720
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,360
in addition that

2721
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,840
that our entire ci process is built on

2722
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,159
on the ubuntu

2723
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:20,239
distribution so it means that anytime

2724
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:22,080
there is a commit that hits

2725
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,199
the github repository or via

2726
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:26,800
different ubuntu versions and different

2727
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,040
php versions on ubuntu we're going to

2728
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,440
get immediately test results on

2729
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,760
on something failing so there's a much

2730
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:34,880
smaller chance of

2731
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,800
something that breaks things uh ending

2732
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,040
up in the code base on ubuntu in general

2733
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,639
with that said uh going back to the

2734
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:42,320
annoyance of operating uh

2735
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,480
either centos or red hat if you're

2736
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,560
familiar with uh

2737
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,800
with loading uh newer versions of

2738
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,719
libraries on those systems that is where

2739
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:53,120
most of the annoyance comes from uh so

2740
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,600
maintaining php versions more modern php

2741
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,520
versions python versions on

2742
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:00,480
uh on centos seven rated seven is a pain

2743
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:03,839
so be prepared for that

2744
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,639
okay someone answers sure yes please but

2745
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:09,760
i don't know well that's for the

2746
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,040
previous one i think uh

2747
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:14,080
for including uh the

2748
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:18,960
opencti brazilian okay great

2749
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,280
we're getting our requirements this one

2750
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,960
is a question that we have very often

2751
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,320
and uh

2752
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,400
maybe it's a lawyer answer but we will

2753
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,679
say it depends

2754
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:30,000
um no the question is like um it's

2755
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,600
really depending on the use case i mean

2756
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:32,000
um

2757
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,239
if you have a for example a missed

2758
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,719
instance dedicated to uh collect uh

2759
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:38,560
phishing emails and you receive like

2760
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,880
thousands of hundred of uh

2761
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:43,280
phishing emails on the daily basis

2762
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,639
indeed you need some artwork to deal

2763
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:45,360
with that

2764
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,199
especially with correlation and so on

2765
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:48,480
but it's really depending on what you're

2766
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,560
ingesting

2767
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,800
it's i think the the thing is for

2768
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,400
example we are operating pretty large

2769
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,760
community with

2770
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,560
normal machines with memory always think

2771
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,000
about the

2772
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,320
aspect on the memory usage of the other

2773
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,120
systems

2774
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,920
but one of the quick quick quick queen

2775
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,520
is really to have a

2776
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:10,159
fast io and obviously you can reach out

2777
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:12,400
with using ssds

2778
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,320
and it's really a quick benefit if it's

2779
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,520
not possible it's still

2780
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,800
fine but but really for for performance

2781
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,280
uh

2782
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,760
resources these are one of the things to

2783
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,800
look at

2784
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,120
yeah so while we can't give you exact

2785
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,880
numbers what we can do is we can go

2786
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,239
through the different things that might

2787
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:29,600
affect performance for you

2788
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:30,880
so we're going to do that now we're

2789
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,239
going to look at some of the scenarios

2790
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:33,920
that will really affect performance

2791
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,159
and what part of your components you can

2792
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:38,239
improve basically to

2793
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:40,159
to get better performance there so let's

2794
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:41,520
have a look

2795
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,560
so basically some of the uh

2796
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,239
really impactful things that will break

2797
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:48,080
your performance uh

2798
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,000
uh have less to do with the amount of

2799
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,920
data surprising and more to do with how

2800
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,440
you're clustering data

2801
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:54,880
so we're having a lot of discussions

2802
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,480
very often with organizations that end

2803
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:58,480
up with performance issues in miss

2804
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:01,120
that end up with very few events with a

2805
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,719
lot of attributes for example so

2806
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:04,320
remember when we were talking about

2807
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:07,040
event creation yesterday we saw how we

2808
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,000
can add individual

2809
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,239
data points to an event and so on and

2810
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:11,840
one of the things that can go wrong very

2811
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,440
often is if you have collection

2812
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,360
mechanisms to automatically collect

2813
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,960
large amounts of data

2814
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,360
that end up in the same event over a

2815
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,960
longer period of time

2816
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:22,639
then every time you're interacting with

2817
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:24,480
the event you're loading the entire

2818
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,600
thing into memory

2819
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,360
now keep in mind in order to build the

2820
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,040
data set first of all ford

2821
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,600
for ingestion by the user you you need a

2822
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:32,719
lot of disk io

2823
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:34,560
because you are going to have to troll

2824
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,239
through the database make

2825
01:33:36,239 --> 01:33:38,800
all those acl decisions that that are

2826
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:39,600
based on

2827
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,400
individual mysql queries and then you

2828
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,159
have to store all this information in

2829
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:45,760
memory in one shot

2830
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,840
so generally large events are are

2831
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:48,960
frowned upon when it comes to

2832
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,800
performance so you can cluster your data

2833
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,159
for example if you have a certain

2834
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:53,440
collection mechanism

2835
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,360
don't concatenate the new data coming in

2836
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,880
every day into the same event

2837
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,120
create daily events for example or

2838
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,560
create weekly events

2839
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,639
clustering the data that way for for the

2840
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:04,239
automatic collection really helps with

2841
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:05,280
performance

2842
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,040
now on top of that correlation is

2843
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,600
another huge aspect of performance uh

2844
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:10,400
it's

2845
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,239
generally and this goes a little bit

2846
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:13,679
against what i just said now

2847
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:15,520
when it comes to clustering data and it

2848
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:16,960
becomes a little bit tricky

2849
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,880
if you repeat the same data over and

2850
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,719
over again you generate correlations

2851
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:21,360
remember

2852
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,800
when we were talking about correlations

2853
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,560
yesterday we saw that if you had an

2854
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,320
ip address for example it exists in a

2855
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,560
different event it is going to correlate

2856
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:29,280
with it

2857
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,520
we've seen some use cases where there

2858
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:32,880
were some

2859
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,719
questionable choices made on which

2860
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:36,960
attributes to correlate on for example

2861
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,800
we saw an example yesterday with ports

2862
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,639
where port 443 could have been

2863
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:41,840
correlated on

2864
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,600
if you have correlations like that that

2865
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,760
are noisy and not really helpful

2866
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,520
those can really blow up the size of

2867
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,679
your correlation table and that will

2868
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:52,239
incur a massive cost on your ram usage

2869
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:53,360
and also on your

2870
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:56,800
disk io so there are some ways to avoid

2871
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:57,119
this

2872
01:34:57,119 --> 01:34:59,280
first of all when you're ingesting feeds

2873
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,639
make sure that you're updating the

2874
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,480
existing feed instead of pulling in new

2875
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:03,920
snapshots of the feed the separate

2876
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,360
events so this is one of the most

2877
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,199
painful things that you can do is not do

2878
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:08,320
that

2879
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:11,119
and then you end up with daily copies of

2880
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:12,960
exactly the same data set that will

2881
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,000
cross-correlate each

2882
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,920
individual data point so the feed

2883
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,840
digestion strategy is important in this

2884
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:18,400
case

2885
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,800
and other than that make choices on what

2886
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:21,920
are valuable

2887
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,159
correlations and not so if you have

2888
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:25,040
something that

2889
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,920
occurs in every event that you you

2890
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:28,800
create

2891
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,080
and it is probably something that you

2892
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,560
don't want to correlate on

2893
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,480
there is another aspect to consider and

2894
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,719
that is over contextualization so

2895
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:39,440
this is a little bit misleading in title

2896
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:39,760
uh

2897
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,800
over contextualization is is when we

2898
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,159
talk about that we're really talking

2899
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:44,600
about

2900
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,480
contextualization that could have been

2901
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,480
avoided and could have been

2902
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,159
done smarter remember when we were

2903
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:51,920
talking about uh

2904
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,719
uh inheritance models in this uh for uh

2905
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:56,000
for context

2906
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,159
uh tagging an event versus tagging each

2907
01:35:58,159 --> 01:35:59,679
individual attribute

2908
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:01,760
we've seen some organizations that ended

2909
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,679
up tagging every single attribute with

2910
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:05,679
the exact same tag in an event

2911
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:07,440
so if you have tlp white that you want

2912
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:08,800
to attach to 10

2913
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,560
000 attributes within the event instead

2914
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,400
of just tagging the event itself

2915
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,480
then you're going to end up with 10 000

2916
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,320
tech connector objects in your database

2917
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,840
versus a single one

2918
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:20,400
this is obviously going to to have cost

2919
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,920
in terms of

2920
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:25,760
the disk disk size or disk usage

2921
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,440
disk speed because you have a larger

2922
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:28,800
table to traverse

2923
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,639
and also on ram whenever you're loading

2924
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:32,320
the data into your memory you're loading

2925
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,600
more data and you're

2926
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,920
you're loading bigger objects into your

2927
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:36,719
memory

2928
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:39,199
so keep this in mind whenever you can

2929
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:41,199
use the inheritance model of miss

2930
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:43,520
tag the entire event stlp white and then

2931
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,119
if you have two attributes out of the

2932
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:45,679
100

2933
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:47,600
000 that you want to restrict tag those

2934
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,679
as tlp red

2935
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,840
basically whenever you're fetching data

2936
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:52,719
and whenever you're building

2937
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:54,159
synchronization filters

2938
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:56,239
use tags as a negative lookup instead of

2939
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:57,760
a positive in this case

2940
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,679
and that allows you to use inheritance

2941
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:01,199
model or cleanly

2942
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:03,199
and it will really save you a lot of ram

2943
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:04,880
and disk space

2944
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,840
for the server

2945
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:13,040
now on the other hand

2946
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:17,280
you want to take it sir um so what was

2947
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,480
really impacting the performance itself

2948
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:20,880
is

2949
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,440
obviously the number of user active um

2950
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:24,880
because those users might

2951
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,719
use the user interface but especially

2952
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:28,159
the api

2953
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:31,440
and then it's depending on the number so

2954
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:34,560
for example if you you have the

2955
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,800
roles the capabilities to limit for

2956
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,480
example on the api level

2957
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,520
uh memory usage and and stuff like that

2958
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:42,560
so

2959
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,560
be super careful there because you might

2960
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:45,679
have people that are

2961
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:48,480
really using activity or api for example

2962
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,159
for us at circle we have one of the

2963
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:52,159
instances where we have 4000 users

2964
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:54,480
uh that's where the issue are coming is

2965
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,000
so users that are

2966
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,320
for example getting the full data set

2967
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,560
without doing pagination

2968
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:01,840
things like that and those one are

2969
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:04,239
obviously consuming ram uh cpu and

2970
01:38:04,239 --> 01:38:05,360
discaio

2971
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:06,639
so that's something that you have to

2972
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:08,719
take care of uh don't hesitate to create

2973
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:10,480
holes with limitation profile and so on

2974
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:11,840
if you you want to do that

2975
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,080
on the other end if people are part of

2976
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,040
the nizac

2977
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:16,960
the best in this case to solve this

2978
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,159
issue is basically people are

2979
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:19,600
synchronizing with their miss and they

2980
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,639
use the indicative

2981
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:22,639
instance for that so that's another

2982
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:24,639
thing another thing that is kind of a

2983
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:25,600
trap i would say

2984
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,840
um we are quite expensive extensive on

2985
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:30,080
the auditing aspect on from misplacement

2986
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:33,440
every actions on mist are logged

2987
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:36,400
but that means it's locked on on disk

2988
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:36,880
and

2989
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,400
every time you access an event you have

2990
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:39,840
all the auditing logging that is

2991
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,440
analyzed and so on

2992
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,679
and it can grow quickly so you can have

2993
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:45,199
a logging there which is like

2994
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:47,280
it's fancy so we can have some deep

2995
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,639
space that are

2996
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:50,480
taken so depending on what you logs and

2997
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:54,159
so on you should be careful on that

2998
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:56,800
a quick note here when by logging

2999
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,480
strategy we also mean that you have

3000
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:01,040
some settings that that turn misp into

3001
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:02,719
more actively logging mode

3002
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:03,920
so it means we have something called a

3003
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,679
paranoid login for example that we use

3004
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:07,679
for debugging ongoing incidents

3005
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:10,000
when we expect full play on the instance

3006
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,520
don't leave these settings on because

3007
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:12,000
these are

3008
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,360
really heavy and they're generating a

3009
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:14,960
lot of additional logs by default what

3010
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:15,920
miss block

3011
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:18,159
is only data creation data modification

3012
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:20,000
and failed authentications

3013
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,480
that will generally be quite okay but if

3014
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,000
you enable any of these additional

3015
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,360
logging mechanisms

3016
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,360
it will get heavy now if you still want

3017
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,199
to enable them but you want to avoid

3018
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:32,560
running out of uh of disk space and

3019
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,800
building massive lock tables there are

3020
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,000
some lock strategy

3021
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,840
in say miss that allow you to take all

3022
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:40,159
these paranoid and additional logging

3023
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:43,199
entries into alternate lock destinations

3024
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:43,840
so you can

3025
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,119
throw those logs into elasticsearch for

3026
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:48,880
example or into or just

3027
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:51,360
push them by a syslog zero mq and avoid

3028
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:55,839
the database logs

3029
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,440
yeah api i was mentioning it already

3030
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,119
that's quite important that

3031
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:03,440
never underestimate so we have a very

3032
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,960
fast flexible api

3033
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:07,520
on mist this one you can basically

3034
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:08,719
search for anything but

3035
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:10,159
if you have substring searches for

3036
01:40:10,159 --> 01:40:12,320
example that are very expensive on

3037
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:16,000
on on the um database uh backend

3038
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,080
it's really something that needs to be

3039
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,280
evaluated so

3040
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:22,320
uh be i think you can log

3041
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,480
what the user is doing on the api level

3042
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:25,600
uh and

3043
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:26,960
sometimes you have to review regular

3044
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,679
with the user if if the api usage is

3045
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:32,080
like the correct one and reuse square on

3046
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:34,159
a regular basis

3047
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:36,480
things that are must expecting that much

3048
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,679
performance and

3049
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:40,480
um usually a quick advantage in this for

3050
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,000
example the warning list

3051
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,719
warning lists are automatically for for

3052
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:46,239
finding false positive and so on and

3053
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:48,000
those running lists are actively using

3054
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,560
the radius caching mechanism there

3055
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,880
which make it pretty fast so that means

3056
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,800
when you turn it on

3057
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,520
it doesn't have a very long large impact

3058
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,239
so it's a

3059
01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:00,959
low impact

3060
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:03,119
thing that are not changing it really

3061
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:04,719
the wrong attribute of the instance

3062
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:06,480
they are indexed straight forward to

3063
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:07,440
access

3064
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,040
[Music]

3065
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,199
things like synchronizations uh

3066
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:12,880
recurring things and so on

3067
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,520
they don't impact performance they might

3068
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:16,080
impact

3069
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:18,639
bandwidth that's another thing that

3070
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:19,679
might be uh

3071
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:21,040
depending on what you are if you're

3072
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,760
doing your pull of a brand new

3073
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:25,840
instance you might have some data coming

3074
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,360
in which makes sense

3075
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,760
um but it's not really a direct impact

3076
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:31,440
from the person

3077
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,280
yeah something else to mention here is

3078
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:36,080
uh when we talk about recurring things

3079
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,560
one of the the the the things that uh

3080
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,000
that give a bad con

3081
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,520
misconception about how miss

3082
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:43,760
synchronization works in new users is

3083
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,600
they need to do the initial sync and the

3084
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,840
initial sync can take a very long time

3085
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,000
it's a huge amount of data but any

3086
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,320
follow-up synchronization will negotiate

3087
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,760
what needs to be updated

3088
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,040
so it means that if you run

3089
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,440
synchronizations every hour versus every

3090
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,920
day or every five minutes versus every

3091
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,360
10 hours or something

3092
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:03,199
the difference will actually not be that

3093
01:42:03,199 --> 01:42:05,199
big because there will be a

3094
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:07,600
short a brief negotiation which takes a

3095
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,679
about a second or so to

3096
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:12,080
to do between two instances and then if

3097
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:13,600
there is no new data

3098
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:16,400
or very little data that was created in

3099
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:17,920
between those

3100
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:20,080
those synchronizations then the actual

3101
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:21,520
update will be really quick

3102
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,920
so don't be afraid to set recurring

3103
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,760
pools now there is one thing that can

3104
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,040
really mess with this

3105
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,400
and the the thing is that when you're

3106
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:29,840
setting recurring pools and you're

3107
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,520
you're scheduling your pools

3108
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,440
be aware that other organizations might

3109
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,040
have the same uh

3110
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,119
sync schedule as you so what we've seen

3111
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:38,960
very often is organizations especially

3112
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,320
in europe seem to want to

3113
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:42,639
synchronize with us just before the

3114
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:43,760
opening

3115
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:45,520
hours for example and they all set their

3116
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,960
big synchronizations which they do

3117
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:49,199
recurrently once a day for some reason

3118
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:50,960
uh for six a.m for example in the

3119
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:52,800
morning and at six a.m we have a massive

3120
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,800
peak of every miss business contacting

3121
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:55,440
ours

3122
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:56,880
and trying to pull so if you want to if

3123
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,480
you want to be nice to your

3124
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:01,280
peers offset your synchronizations by a

3125
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:02,960
few minutes for example and don't do it

3126
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:04,800
on the full hour for example

3127
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,239
and that will already help distribute

3128
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:07,920
the load if you have very

3129
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:10,719
broad uh networks with a lot of

3130
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:12,719
interconnectedness instances

3131
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:14,560
yeah or forget to synchronize the clock

3132
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:16,080
of your server

3133
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:19,360
um another thing that is interesting too

3134
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:20,239
and that's

3135
01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:22,560
really a benefit of that is those kind

3136
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,400
of public optional that we have

3137
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:27,280
uh the zeromq the kafka and so on those

3138
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:28,880
one are basically

3139
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:31,360
costless i mean they it's a constant

3140
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,480
stream of data

3141
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:34,480
you plug your tool there and you analyze

3142
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:36,320
the data because there's no active query

3143
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:37,520
on the system

3144
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,040
like calling the database and so on is

3145
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:41,199
really something so enable those

3146
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:44,159
um have really no cost and it's a huge

3147
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:45,520
advantage

3148
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,280
there are some some things that you have

3149
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:48,800
to take into account because some are

3150
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,840
for example the full data set that are

3151
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:53,440
streamed so security-wise you have to be

3152
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:55,119
careful so don't put it publicly on the

3153
01:43:55,119 --> 01:43:55,840
internet

3154
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,840
but nevertheless it's really interesting

3155
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,119
for uh having

3156
01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:00,639
automatic processing and we know some

3157
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:02,480
organizations for example cern is doing

3158
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,679
that

3159
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:06,080
they stream directly the data for

3160
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:07,920
querying their vm

3161
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:10,639
and feeding their instruction detection

3162
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:11,280
system

3163
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,920
so it's an easy way to avoid to do the

3164
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:14,639
query

3165
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:16,960
and just processor that has come in the

3166
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,480
system and it's really

3167
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:19,920
and it's really nice because it's

3168
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,600
basically just a stream of data and it

3169
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,119
costs nothing on the artwork site so

3170
01:44:23,119 --> 01:44:23,440
it's

3171
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:26,800
really really interesting okay with

3172
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:28,400
notifications um

3173
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,400
we have plenty of photification

3174
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:31,600
mechanism uh

3175
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:33,119
obviously we have the default one which

3176
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:34,960
is the username password

3177
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:37,600
nothing extravagant there then we have

3178
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:39,040
plenty of

3179
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:41,920
built-in third-party tools um we have an

3180
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:42,800
ldap one

3181
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:46,320
uh we have shibulet one x509 client of

3182
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:46,800
chicago

3183
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:50,000
an open id one we have um azure active

3184
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,840
directory those one are bundled in so

3185
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,840
we've done the additional library so

3186
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,600
for example she bullet is used by many

3187
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,119
organizations um

3188
01:44:57,119 --> 01:45:00,159
so if you're used to that one it's

3189
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:01,920
quite handy so like that you have a

3190
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:04,560
dedicated idp for the notifications

3191
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:07,040
um same for various for open id like

3192
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,639
like that you can you can connect

3193
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:10,800
to open edit uh notifications

3194
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:12,560
nevertheless sometimes you have custom

3195
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:12,960
one

3196
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,880
and we have uh what you call a

3197
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,159
customized system

3198
01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:19,119
which is based on http headers and you

3199
01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:20,080
can really have

3200
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,920
customized modules so if you have a

3201
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,840
reverse proxy for example with a

3202
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,840
very obscure otp that you are using and

3203
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:26,960
sounds fine

3204
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:29,360
you can just pass specific parameters

3205
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:30,159
and get

3206
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:32,880
uh notifications there's another one

3207
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:33,600
that is like

3208
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:37,679
um i would say a poor man otp

3209
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:39,920
but this one is quite handy and i know a

3210
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:40,719
lot of

3211
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:42,960
isaac using it uh because it's easy to

3212
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:44,800
set up it's an email otp

3213
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:47,040
so you uh each user when they're logged

3214
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,520
in an otp code is sent by emails

3215
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:50,960
and they have to log you within five

3216
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:53,119
minutes or ten minutes on are using that

3217
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:53,760
otp

3218
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:56,159
so it's kind of off second factor uh

3219
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:57,679
it's it's quite interesting because it

3220
01:45:57,679 --> 01:45:59,520
avoids uh people uh

3221
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:02,000
credential and so on to uh to get

3222
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,280
compromise and

3223
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:06,400
access to their mix and it's like

3224
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,159
a very light way to set up and

3225
01:46:08,159 --> 01:46:10,480
especially that if you have pgp setup

3226
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:14,880
the ocp will be 750. so that's fantastic

3227
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,880
and extending miss for an additional

3228
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,639
documentation is not that complex but if

3229
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:20,400
you want to have a specific one you can

3230
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:21,199
you can add

3231
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:23,040
but have a look at the custom order this

3232
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,760
one is well documented in the amisbook

3233
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,480
and you can really make your custom

3234
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:31,440
notification as you want

3235
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,320
yeah apart from that there are some

3236
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,920
other considerations

3237
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:37,199
that you need to do and this is

3238
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:39,199
something that organizations are often

3239
01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:40,480
struggling with

3240
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,560
uh now keep in mind misplaced running on

3241
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,960
top of php and mysql and and this stack

3242
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:46,800
is very often built

3243
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:49,679
to serve a lot of users with very small

3244
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:51,440
lightweight queries now misp is kind of

3245
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:52,560
the opposite

3246
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,480
we're serving a few users even in the

3247
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,920
largest of communities that we have

3248
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,760
we're talking about a few thousand users

3249
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:58,880
at a time

3250
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,280
uh so it's not exactly massive amounts

3251
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:02,080
of

3252
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,960
of users but the queries can be quite

3253
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,560
heavy when you're dealing with

3254
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:09,199
uh with massive events with hundreds of

3255
01:47:09,199 --> 01:47:10,560
thousands of attributes and

3256
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,880
for example sticks conversions then you

3257
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:14,880
can already imagine what sort of memory

3258
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,880
usages we're talking about here and uh

3259
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:20,159
what sort of processing times we're

3260
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:21,119
talking about

3261
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:23,600
so they can be quite heavy so one of the

3262
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:24,960
things that you need to do when you're

3263
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:25,840
starting out today

3264
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:27,600
and give some guidance in our diagnostic

3265
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,760
page ms is to first of all

3266
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:33,119
um change your settings in php and mysql

3267
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:33,760
to

3268
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,840
cater to this more unusual use case for

3269
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,199
those languages

3270
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:39,280
so for example with php we generally

3271
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:41,360
increase the memory usage per process to

3272
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:42,960
at least two gigs of memory

3273
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:44,639
this allows us to build those massive

3274
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:46,719
data sets in one shot

3275
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:49,679
we also raise the timeout settings

3276
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:50,960
because some of the queries can take

3277
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:51,840
some time to go

3278
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,960
to compose and to serve back to users

3279
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:58,080
and we're also very often uh modifying

3280
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,239
how miss will behave for certain roles

3281
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:02,000
that means that if you're running a hub

3282
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,679
instance that you're also using as your

3283
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:05,119
operational instance

3284
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:07,360
give preference to your own internal api

3285
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,040
users that are feeding your seam you

3286
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,800
don't want to for example

3287
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,719
be memory starved when you're dealing

3288
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:14,960
with

3289
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:16,639
with feeding your own tools and running

3290
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:19,360
out of memory in that that sense

3291
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,960
so be careful with that and make sure

3292
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:23,119
that you set up

3293
01:48:23,119 --> 01:48:25,440
the roles correctly with memory mods

3294
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:26,960
something else to consider here

3295
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:28,719
as well is and this is a little bit

3296
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:30,880
misleading misspell almost never run out

3297
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:33,040
of memory so we built it in a way

3298
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:35,040
where whenever you're fetching data it

3299
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:36,960
does internal clustering of what you're

3300
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:37,840
fetching

3301
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:39,679
so what this means in practice when

3302
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:41,920
you're generating a massive suricata

3303
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:44,480
rule set for example out of vesp

3304
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:47,520
spending millions of attributes uh this

3305
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:49,199
is a data set that will obviously not

3306
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:49,840
fit into

3307
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:52,560
your two gig or one gig envelope that

3308
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:54,560
you configured in php in one shot so

3309
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:55,760
what miss will do

3310
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:57,360
is it will depending on the amount of

3311
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,360
available memory for a process

3312
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,600
cluster the data into smaller chunks and

3313
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,520
do several trips to the database to

3314
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:06,719
fetch the data convert it

3315
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:08,400
store it into a file and then when the

3316
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,000
whole thing is done

3317
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,480
compose it and send it back to the user

3318
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,719
now the the the downside of this is that

3319
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:15,520
usa a

3320
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:18,560
user will not notice any memory outages

3321
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:20,159
but whenever you have a small memory

3322
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:22,000
envelope it means more round trips the

3323
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
database more anxious to the conversion

3324
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:24,239
and

3325
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:27,679
the disk io so it will

3326
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:29,000
the system kind of masks

3327
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,960
misconfigurations in this way

3328
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:32,719
but in these cases increasing the memory

3329
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:34,719
envelope can have a drastic effect on

3330
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:36,560
the performance of the system

3331
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,239
so keep that in mind as well same thing

3332
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:40,880
with mysql especially tuning the

3333
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:43,920
key buffer sizes has a massive impact uh

3334
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:44,960
so if we if

3335
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:49,040
we give more memory to uh to what uh

3336
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:52,000
mysql can use for indexes and so on then

3337
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,280
you're going to have much better

3338
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,040
performance in general

3339
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:58,320
so all together to to sum it all up tune

3340
01:49:58,320 --> 01:49:58,960
for

3341
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:00,719
few heavy requests as opposed to many

3342
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:03,280
light ones

3343
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:07,760
so um thing that you you might consider

3344
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:10,239
too and i think this one is important

3345
01:50:10,239 --> 01:50:13,920
it's quite easy to cluster miss

3346
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:16,639
miss works quite well on on on reverse

3347
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:18,000
proxy solutions

3348
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,480
uh you can not balance passion once on

3349
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,480
just a side note regarding that

3350
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,239
sometimes it's not needed to to do

3351
01:50:24,239 --> 01:50:26,239
clustering uh if you have a very

3352
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:27,760
intensive application

3353
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:30,320
and so on you can for example use the

3354
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:32,000
ability of the local

3355
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,880
misp to have a dedicated miss part of a

3356
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:36,560
set of different myths and you

3357
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:38,880
have this kind of highly intensive

3358
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,040
action and so on that myth and you just

3359
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,440
for example pull the cache feed on a

3360
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:44,480
regular basis

3361
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:47,119
nevertheless when you have a large user

3362
01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:48,560
base and you want to cluster you can

3363
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:49,360
load balance

3364
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:52,080
bachelor with mist and you have to

3365
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:53,599
replicate the database and there's two

3366
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:55,199
databases to replicate

3367
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:57,040
uh you have the release back-end which

3368
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:59,440
is like straightforward to replicate and

3369
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,760
same with mysql or maya db

3370
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:04,880
you have a classification scenario there

3371
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,080
the only thing that you have to be

3372
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:09,119
careful uh is to ensure that you pin

3373
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:11,040
the session or specific user on the same

3374
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,560
one so if you're for example using asha

3375
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,599
proxy

3376
01:51:13,599 --> 01:51:17,119
you can ensure that you stick a specific

3377
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:17,599
user

3378
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:19,679
to a specific session on this reverse

3379
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:22,080
proxy to not end up load balancing onto

3380
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:23,599
different servers and then we have

3381
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:26,560
like a set of i don't know users going

3382
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:27,440
on one one

3383
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:29,520
instant and the other so it's easier for

3384
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:31,760
for

3385
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:35,599
load uh don't forget that you have a lot

3386
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:36,880
of things there uh

3387
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,599
not only the database but you have the

3388
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:40,960
storage of the attachment which is

3389
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,000
outside of it

3390
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,760
and then you have to abstract that one

3391
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:45,920
um we have already an option for s3

3392
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:48,320
storage but for example if you have nfs

3393
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,840
storage in the back end

3394
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,199
you have to take that into consideration

3395
01:51:51,199 --> 01:51:54,000
if you save a backend or

3396
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,080
distribute drdb file systems you can use

3397
01:51:58,080 --> 01:51:58,800
it

3398
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,639
but you just need to attach that

3399
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:02,639
specific directory in this network

3400
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:04,080
storage and make it available

3401
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:05,599
on both sides that works out of the box

3402
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:07,679
so it works um you have some very good

3403
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:09,040
example uh someone

3404
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:12,159
maintaining one for amazon observations

3405
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:13,520
we know some of those organizations

3406
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:15,520
using reverse proxy with kubernetes and

3407
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:16,320
so on

3408
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,719
um so it's for the one that i used to do

3409
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:20,400
i have ability and proxy i mean

3410
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,080
myth is not a complex software to do

3411
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:24,239
there's not that much component so

3412
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:26,000
as long as you know what you're doing on

3413
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,520
on the network side

3414
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:29,360
and the storage site you are you are

3415
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:31,679
yourself

3416
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:33,280
okay that's that's basically it for the

3417
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,840
session so no we will do the

3418
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:39,599
quick 15 15 minutes break maybe we start

3419
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:41,360
at

3420
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:45,280
5 10 my time um so so we start in the

3421
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:47,679
around 15 minutes uh and then we will go

3422
01:52:47,679 --> 01:52:49,119
more into the

3423
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:52,159
usage of missed feet

3424
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:55,199
and so on an extension with uh so we

3425
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:56,560
will start

3426
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:13,840
back in 15 minutes thank you very much

3427
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:44,480
welcome back everyone um so

3428
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:46,639
no i'm probably interested alex i think

3429
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:48,000
we still have like four minutes because

3430
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,280
i think we said 10 past now

3431
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:54,159
okay

3432
01:53:54,159 --> 01:53:57,199
before we leave someone out to this too

3433
01:53:57,199 --> 01:54:09,839
no if grabbing a drink

3434
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:51,280
okay so welcome back everyone

3435
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:55,280
um just a quick uh quick nose regarding

3436
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:57,119
the access to the miss pinstand that we

3437
01:58:57,119 --> 01:58:58,159
provide for this

3438
01:58:58,159 --> 01:59:03,119
session um we have um

3439
01:59:03,119 --> 01:59:06,639
icmd pad that i will share in the chat

3440
01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:08,560
which contains the urls and the

3441
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:11,360
information about how to access

3442
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:15,199
this instance there are 50 accounts so

3443
01:59:15,199 --> 01:59:15,440
you

3444
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:17,360
just pick one if you are sharing account

3445
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:18,639
it's not a big deal as long as you don't

3446
01:59:18,639 --> 01:59:19,840
change password

3447
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:23,599
uh so it's training one up to 50 at

3448
01:59:23,599 --> 01:59:25,280
least the test and then the password is

3449
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:27,040
training first and first uppercase with

3450
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:27,280
t

3451
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:30,560
uppercase and from 21. um and then

3452
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:33,599
the urge is mentioned there so you can

3453
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:35,360
have access you can have a look at it uh

3454
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:37,040
we will keep this instance running

3455
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:39,199
until the end of the week so if you want

3456
01:59:39,199 --> 01:59:40,960
to play during the weekend with the miss

3457
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:41,840
instant you can

3458
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:45,440
continue to do it and that will remain

3459
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:48,000
available so yesterday we did a quick

3460
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,599
introduction and a quick tour about

3461
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:52,639
creating a specific misp event

3462
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:55,040
we didn't go into too deep into all the

3463
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:57,360
different aspects

3464
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:00,639
such as um synchronizations feed sharing

3465
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:02,159
groups and so on so

3466
02:00:02,159 --> 02:00:04,000
uh now we will take the opportunity to

3467
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,360
uh to predict in that

3468
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:07,840
aspect um so yesterday we tested an

3469
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:10,960
event uh which was based on the input

3470
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:14,400
on someone else so we receive an email

3471
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:14,880
and then we

3472
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:17,360
start to structure missed events with

3473
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:19,040
all the objects and so on

3474
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:20,960
um uh we wanted to show you an

3475
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:22,480
additional one and this one is coming

3476
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:23,199
from a

3477
02:00:23,199 --> 02:00:26,400
from an external source for e4 which is

3478
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:28,480
about

3479
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:32,000
cobalus which is a targeting

3480
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,520
hpc systems worldwide and it was to show

3481
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:36,639
a functionality and

3482
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:39,119
it was just a question that was that was

3483
02:00:39,119 --> 02:00:40,639
just perfect on timing uh

3484
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:43,360
about uh markdown and even report um so

3485
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:44,480
in misc we have a

3486
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:46,239
complete integrated systems where you

3487
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:48,080
can um add

3488
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:50,639
unstructured information so at first it

3489
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:52,800
looks a bit strange because myth is

3490
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:54,800
deserved for having structural

3491
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:56,400
information so that means objects that

3492
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:57,599
review that you can pass

3493
02:00:57,599 --> 02:00:59,599
the machine and so on but over the time

3494
02:00:59,599 --> 02:01:01,599
we have seen an interest to have

3495
02:01:01,599 --> 02:01:04,239
attached something that is more hybrid

3496
02:01:04,239 --> 02:01:05,199
containing

3497
02:01:05,199 --> 02:01:08,400
the report itself and the details along

3498
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:08,960
with this

3499
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:11,280
structural information and that's why we

3500
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:12,159
added

3501
02:01:12,159 --> 02:01:14,159
something called something called even

3502
02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:15,360
report

3503
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:17,280
which is a completely complete system

3504
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:18,719
for doing

3505
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:21,119
human readable report there so for this

3506
02:01:21,119 --> 02:01:22,719
case it's coming from a

3507
02:01:22,719 --> 02:01:25,840
report that we directly imported into

3508
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:27,119
and to miss so

3509
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:30,239
you can for example take a new rfc misp

3510
02:01:30,239 --> 02:01:32,400
paste it so you just need to use

3511
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:34,159
activate it so you import

3512
02:01:34,159 --> 02:01:36,239
a new arrest there you put the urls and

3513
02:01:36,239 --> 02:01:37,440
these urls will be converted

3514
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:39,040
automatically into markdown format and

3515
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:40,719
that's what we did with that one

3516
02:01:40,719 --> 02:01:44,080
um we imported the report

3517
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:48,639
from the horizontal artillery vendors

3518
02:01:48,639 --> 02:01:51,280
and automatically this one was imported

3519
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:52,880
as a markdown

3520
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:56,159
format so we we did some

3521
02:01:56,159 --> 02:01:59,119
customization of this report for you

3522
02:01:59,119 --> 02:01:59,840
that

3523
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:01,520
is not only the report itself that we

3524
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:04,080
import but we can add reference to the

3525
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:05,520
structural information that we have

3526
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:07,599
emitted

3527
02:02:07,599 --> 02:02:10,159
for this specific case what you can see

3528
02:02:10,159 --> 02:02:11,040
for example

3529
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:14,320
we have a reference to a tag which is a

3530
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:15,520
specific galaxy

3531
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:18,719
so the thing is be the

3532
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:22,719
editor in um

3533
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:26,080
in that system you can directly add

3534
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:29,040
additional information so and that's

3535
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:31,520
exactly the thing that we did here

3536
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:35,280
with it on this one we add a specific

3537
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:37,599
tag for the the galaxy so if you look at

3538
02:02:37,599 --> 02:02:40,000
the one that has been encoded there i

3539
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,199
don't know why

3540
02:02:41,199 --> 02:02:44,560
the mother is super slow so we

3541
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:46,239
have here a reference which is a

3542
02:02:46,239 --> 02:02:48,480
reference to directly the tag and you

3543
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:50,159
can include it into the report

3544
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:52,159
and you have the direct reference to the

3545
02:02:52,159 --> 02:02:54,560
cluster of the galaxy

3546
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:56,719
it's exactly the same with attributes so

3547
02:02:56,719 --> 02:02:57,760
we had an attribute

3548
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:00,560
describing the specific tag and also

3549
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:01,920
encode that you can manually

3550
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:04,480
call it but this in the system itself

3551
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:06,239
there is an automatic extraction so you

3552
02:03:06,239 --> 02:03:06,960
can

3553
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:09,599
do manually fractional automatic

3554
02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:10,400
automatic will

3555
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:12,400
just do it for you and then everything

3556
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:13,840
will be

3557
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:15,440
done but you can do a manual extraction

3558
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:17,360
so that means you have to validate

3559
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:20,000
yourself the extraction that the system

3560
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,080
found so in this case for example you

3561
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:23,599
found some exp

3562
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:25,760
specific things like for example canada

3563
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:27,440
china kobalus

3564
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:30,239
ssh and so on uh and automatically mist

3565
02:03:30,239 --> 02:03:31,440
is trying to

3566
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:33,040
find doing kind of natural language

3567
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:35,360
processing so it's basically a large set

3568
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:37,440
of regular expression and so on

3569
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:40,000
um to extract this information and then

3570
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,440
then you can decide

3571
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:43,920
to uh save and replace into ones we

3572
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:45,760
already did for this report

3573
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:48,079
um but you can play with it and and try

3574
02:03:48,079 --> 02:03:50,159
with some urls and an event and

3575
02:03:50,159 --> 02:03:51,920
automatic you'll see that the

3576
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:55,440
extraction is done by the

3577
02:03:55,440 --> 02:03:57,679
system and then you have a report so

3578
02:03:57,679 --> 02:03:59,920
this report is attached to the event

3579
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:02,000
so that means it will be synchronized

3580
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,040
share and so on

3581
02:04:03,040 --> 02:04:05,840
directly with the others uh you have

3582
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:07,520
reference to for example my attack

3583
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:08,400
technique

3584
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:11,598
and you have a

3585
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:14,400
complete complete view like the matrix

3586
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:15,520
attack and so on

3587
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:18,159
uh directly there so if i'm just looking

3588
02:04:18,159 --> 02:04:19,199
at the

3589
02:04:19,199 --> 02:04:22,320
overall view you have this uh

3590
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:25,360
things directly in the report

3591
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:29,780
which is still there next to the um

3592
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:32,950
[Music]

3593
02:04:35,119 --> 02:04:36,880
to the mist even itself and you can have

3594
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:38,639
multiple you can have multiple reports

3595
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:39,679
so you can

3596
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:41,760
add manually uh think that an analysis

3597
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:43,280
is working so it could work in various

3598
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:44,880
ways to do in the work that

3599
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:46,800
you start doing analysis and you take

3600
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,719
some notes as marked on and then you

3601
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:51,119
continue to do your

3602
02:04:51,119 --> 02:04:52,800
this addition of information like

3603
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:54,560
attribute objects and so on

3604
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:57,360
or you can take an existing report

3605
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:59,599
mardon or html and so on

3606
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:01,920
import it and then start with his

3607
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:04,079
information so it's a gain of time

3608
02:05:04,079 --> 02:05:06,480
and you can use it as a kind of notebook

3609
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:08,320
uh to share information so you if you

3610
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:08,639
are

3611
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:10,480
familiar to gp download book and so on

3612
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:12,239
it's a bit similar it's like

3613
02:05:12,239 --> 02:05:14,159
you have this kind of integration there

3614
02:05:14,159 --> 02:05:16,000
with the reference um

3615
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:21,440
behind on on on on the event

3616
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:24,560
okay so perhaps something else that is

3617
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:25,840
interesting with that one so

3618
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:27,920
that report as well at the end so you

3619
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:29,679
can include images as well in the

3620
02:05:29,679 --> 02:05:31,679
reports and you can also include

3621
02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:34,079
if you look at the end of the report

3622
02:05:34,079 --> 02:05:35,199
things such as the

3623
02:05:35,199 --> 02:05:37,119
the attack matrix that shows a summary

3624
02:05:37,119 --> 02:05:38,000
of all the

3625
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,520
[Music]

3626
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:42,880
techniques used in the event

3627
02:05:43,119 --> 02:05:44,960
yeah so any attachment that you do for

3628
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:46,159
example in misp

3629
02:05:46,159 --> 02:05:48,480
can be displayed directly in this report

3630
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:50,719
so it's it's really nice because i mean

3631
02:05:50,719 --> 02:05:52,880
sometimes um depending on the case but

3632
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,159
you you want to share this kind of

3633
02:05:54,159 --> 02:05:55,599
structural information for automatic

3634
02:05:55,599 --> 02:05:56,560
processing

3635
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:58,639
uh speeding your analysis tool and so on

3636
02:05:58,639 --> 02:06:00,079
but at the same time you want to keep a

3637
02:06:00,079 --> 02:06:02,719
humanitable version next to it

3638
02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:05,599
for a supporting analyst or other people

3639
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:08,639
to read the document

3640
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:16,320
so perhaps uh now what we can do is we

3641
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:17,760
can move over to some of the other stuff

3642
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:18,239
that

3643
02:06:18,239 --> 02:06:19,920
that we missed in the first day that are

3644
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:21,520
still important

3645
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:23,520
so we one of the things that we haven't

3646
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:24,639
really talked about is

3647
02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:26,719
uh how to interconnect your messp

3648
02:06:26,719 --> 02:06:27,840
instances

3649
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:30,560
so this is uh the most common use case

3650
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:32,000
when you're starting out with misp you

3651
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,679
want to connect to other communities out

3652
02:06:33,679 --> 02:06:34,400
there

3653
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:36,480
and first a little bit about the concept

3654
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:37,840
of how this works

3655
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:40,079
basically the exchange of data between

3656
02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:41,040
misspin synthesis

3657
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:43,440
happens through specialized users in

3658
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:45,199
lisp so what happens is when you're

3659
02:06:45,199 --> 02:06:46,560
asking for access from a different

3660
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:48,639
community they create a user for you

3661
02:06:48,639 --> 02:06:50,000
a special type of user called the

3662
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,679
synchronization user

3663
02:06:51,679 --> 02:06:53,280
and then through the synchronization

3664
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:55,679
users api key your miss can log into the

3665
02:06:55,679 --> 02:06:57,199
remote responses

3666
02:06:57,199 --> 02:06:59,040
and start creating data or start

3667
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:00,480
fetching data

3668
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:02,960
so this already raises the question how

3669
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:04,639
do you want to interconnect with another

3670
02:07:04,639 --> 02:07:06,880
community do i want a one-way connection

3671
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:08,880
where you are always initiator of any

3672
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:11,040
exchange you're pushing data you're

3673
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:12,800
pulling data from a remote side

3674
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:14,480
or you can have a two-way connection

3675
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:16,880
where both instances exchange sync users

3676
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:17,760
and then you can

3677
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:20,960
start pushing in both directions so what

3678
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:22,320
we're going to do now is we're not going

3679
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:23,840
to go through the entire process but

3680
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:25,199
we're going to show you quickly what

3681
02:07:25,199 --> 02:07:27,119
this actually looks like

3682
02:07:27,119 --> 02:07:30,320
so here we already have a server

3683
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:31,440
connection encoded

3684
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:33,119
and it's best to show off normally with

3685
02:07:33,119 --> 02:07:34,400
your own miss for instance but we can

3686
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:36,159
absolutely just use a look back to the

3687
02:07:36,159 --> 02:07:38,400
same instance to just show what happens

3688
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:39,840
once you encode the connection if we

3689
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:41,760
just quickly show what a connection edit

3690
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:43,679
looks like so that we see what uh

3691
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:46,239
what sort of fields are required to just

3692
02:07:46,239 --> 02:07:46,880
very quickly

3693
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:49,440
show an existing connection or that yeah

3694
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:51,360
so basically

3695
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:55,199
yeah either works yeah

3696
02:07:55,199 --> 02:07:57,119
so basically what you need to encode a

3697
02:07:57,119 --> 02:07:58,800
connection is first of all the url of

3698
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:00,000
the remote instance

3699
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,079
you need to name the remote instance and

3700
02:08:02,079 --> 02:08:03,679
then the most important thing are those

3701
02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:05,520
three fields below

3702
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:08,639
which basically define who owns a remote

3703
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:10,480
instance please be very careful when

3704
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:11,679
you're encoding this this is where

3705
02:08:11,679 --> 02:08:12,800
everything can go wrong with

3706
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,320
synchronization links

3707
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:16,960
make sure that the organization that you

3708
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:19,199
set here is the owner of the remote side

3709
02:08:19,199 --> 02:08:20,639
not yourself

3710
02:08:20,639 --> 02:08:23,760
so people are often confused by the

3711
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:26,800
local organization

3712
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:28,639
drop down there it is not your

3713
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:30,159
organization that you're encoding but

3714
02:08:30,159 --> 02:08:31,360
who owns the connection that you're

3715
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:32,480
connecting to

3716
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:34,960
once you set that at the api key that

3717
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:36,000
you've gotten

3718
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,440
and at that point you don't need to

3719
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:39,840
configure any pull strategies push

3720
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:41,520
strategies and so on you can leave all

3721
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:42,800
of that for later

3722
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:44,239
but the important thing is to just get

3723
02:08:44,239 --> 02:08:46,480
the initial connection you're running so

3724
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:47,840
once you've done that you can run a

3725
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:49,280
connection test

3726
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:51,119
so this what this will do is it will

3727
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:53,360
lock and authenticate with the remote

3728
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:54,079
instance

3729
02:08:54,079 --> 02:08:56,079
it will check whether your credentials

3730
02:08:56,079 --> 02:08:58,079
are correct whether your access is

3731
02:08:58,079 --> 02:08:58,960
correct

3732
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:00,880
and where whether your miss princess is

3733
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:02,800
compatible the remote side

3734
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:05,040
so this tool will already flag a lot of

3735
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:07,119
things that could go wrong at this stage

3736
02:09:07,119 --> 02:09:09,360
it could be certificate issues so for

3737
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:10,400
example if the

3738
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:12,159
remote side is using a self-signed

3739
02:09:12,159 --> 02:09:13,440
certificate or a

3740
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:15,920
certificate signed by a custom signing

3741
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:17,760
authority that's not known by the

3742
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:18,810
mozilla

3743
02:09:18,810 --> 02:09:21,520
[Music]

3744
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:23,840
certificate store you could have an

3745
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:25,199
issue with the api key

3746
02:09:25,199 --> 02:09:26,880
you could have an issue with the remote

3747
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:28,719
site's user so the sync user that you've

3748
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:29,040
got

3749
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:31,280
not actually being a sync user but a

3750
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:32,320
normal user

3751
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:34,159
instead so all of these would be flagged

3752
02:09:34,159 --> 02:09:36,400
and explained as issues here

3753
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:38,560
so make sure that you that if you're

3754
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,840
having issues with connecting to the

3755
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,280
other instance you run the connection

3756
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:41,920
test and you

3757
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:44,000
read the guidance that you get there

3758
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,599
there are two other tests that are run

3759
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:47,119
here one is called the compatibility

3760
02:09:47,119 --> 02:09:47,760
test

3761
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:49,599
so what this one does is it compares

3762
02:09:49,599 --> 02:09:51,840
your version of miss with the remote

3763
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:53,920
so generally all versions of miss that

3764
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:55,760
you've installed in the past five years

3765
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:57,760
should be compatible with each other

3766
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:59,119
and we're not planning on breaking

3767
02:09:59,119 --> 02:10:00,880
compatibility for synchronization so

3768
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:02,159
this is something that is not that

3769
02:10:02,159 --> 02:10:03,520
relevant anymore

3770
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:05,840
however we also reveal the version of

3771
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:07,280
the remote miss vincent's when you're

3772
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:08,480
connecting

3773
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:10,079
now this is a good moment to talk a

3774
02:10:10,079 --> 02:10:12,239
little bit about vulnerabilities and

3775
02:10:12,239 --> 02:10:13,920
reporting of uh

3776
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:16,159
of security issues with mis we're a

3777
02:10:16,159 --> 02:10:18,320
c-search ourselves so for us it is very

3778
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:20,400
important that we're very vocal and very

3779
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:22,480
open about security issues

3780
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:26,079
we get about 12 to 15

3781
02:10:26,079 --> 02:10:27,920
pen test results a year from different

3782
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:29,440
organizations

3783
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:32,719
uh so anytime we get something we get a

3784
02:10:32,719 --> 02:10:34,960
report that contains anything that could

3785
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:36,800
be

3786
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:38,880
considered vulnerability or an issue

3787
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:40,880
with the security posture of

3788
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:43,920
we're going to raise the alarm bells

3789
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:46,480
ask for a cve number and inform the

3790
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:47,840
community

3791
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:49,360
that means that if you're following your

3792
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:50,960
twitter account for example as

3793
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:53,199
atmos project uh and you're running a

3794
02:10:53,199 --> 02:10:54,800
miss pensions anytime there is

3795
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:57,840
a security release you know that

3796
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:00,159
security issue has been patched if you

3797
02:11:00,159 --> 02:11:01,840
see that your partner is running an

3798
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:03,760
outdated miss vincent's consider

3799
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:05,119
severing the connection link and

3800
02:11:05,119 --> 02:11:06,719
informing them that they need to update

3801
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:08,840
before you risk

3802
02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:12,719
um basically your data getting uh

3803
02:11:12,719 --> 02:11:15,040
compromised on on the remote side if

3804
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:16,560
they're not updated

3805
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:19,040
uh so this is also a good way for us to

3806
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:20,800
check whether whether we're exchanging

3807
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:22,159
information without keeping your

3808
02:11:22,159 --> 02:11:24,239
software up to date or not

3809
02:11:24,239 --> 02:11:25,840
finally there is this little post test

3810
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:28,320
at the end that one really just flags

3811
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:29,360
issues with

3812
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:31,280
misconfigured reverse proxies if you're

3813
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:32,960
running a reverse proxy and terminate

3814
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:34,480
https at the boundary

3815
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:38,239
what can happen with misconfigured

3816
02:11:38,239 --> 02:11:41,119
blue codes and so on that we noticed is

3817
02:11:41,119 --> 02:11:43,040
that they can truncate requests

3818
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:45,199
after a certain size for example if that

3819
02:11:45,199 --> 02:11:46,719
happens you might have

3820
02:11:46,719 --> 02:11:48,560
partial failures of the synchronization

3821
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:50,320
in mis whenever there is larger data

3822
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:52,320
package it gets truncated and it doesn't

3823
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:55,520
uh it doesn't manage to fetch a new

3824
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:57,119
event from the remote

3825
02:11:57,119 --> 02:11:58,880
and we basically built a little tool

3826
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:00,400
there to debug that so

3827
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:02,159
if that one fails check your reverse

3828
02:12:02,159 --> 02:12:04,560
proxy if it's correctly configured

3829
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:06,639
there are two questions there uh so one

3830
02:12:06,639 --> 02:12:07,760
is i have a misprint

3831
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:09,360
a testing environment should i use

3832
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:11,599
health science certainly or trusted ca

3833
02:12:11,599 --> 02:12:13,520
i mean trusted c is for testing

3834
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:15,599
environment it really doesn't matter

3835
02:12:15,599 --> 02:12:17,760
but nowadays getting at a trusted

3836
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:19,760
certificate with let's encrypt at least

3837
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:20,239
it's so

3838
02:12:20,239 --> 02:12:22,159
so easy there is no reason not to do it

3839
02:12:22,159 --> 02:12:23,280
anymore

3840
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:25,360
uh so generally we always recommend you

3841
02:12:25,360 --> 02:12:26,400
just do it and it

3842
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:28,400
makes your life a lot easier and there

3843
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:31,440
is a way to to flag a connection in misp

3844
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:34,480
as as a self-signed certificate

3845
02:12:34,480 --> 02:12:36,719
connection if you provide the

3846
02:12:36,719 --> 02:12:39,040
certificate and upload the certificate

3847
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:40,719
to misplace if you can quickly show that

3848
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:43,360
alex how to do it in a configuration

3849
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:46,719
if you just edit the server link

3850
02:12:47,599 --> 02:12:50,560
you're muted by the way

3851
02:12:52,239 --> 02:12:55,840
alex you're muted

3852
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:59,040
okay if you scroll down

3853
02:13:00,079 --> 02:13:02,400
so there you see that you can upload the

3854
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:04,159
server certificate and you can

3855
02:13:04,159 --> 02:13:07,599
uh tell miss that the remote side is a

3856
02:13:07,599 --> 02:13:09,760
self-signed uh certificate so in that

3857
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:11,360
case um

3858
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:13,520
you can use your use that as well but

3859
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:15,280
generally there is no reason to do it

3860
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:16,320
really

3861
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:19,280
okay now going back to our server index

3862
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:19,599
uh

3863
02:13:19,599 --> 02:13:21,199
once you're done with the initial setup

3864
02:13:21,199 --> 02:13:23,040
you see that the connection is working

3865
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:24,639
don't line to start ingesting the data

3866
02:13:24,639 --> 02:13:26,400
from the other side

3867
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:28,000
it might be a good idea to first check

3868
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,800
what sort of data the other site has

3869
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:32,239
in order to do that just click on the

3870
02:13:32,239 --> 02:13:34,079
little magnifying glass on your server

3871
02:13:34,079 --> 02:13:35,040
connection

3872
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:36,719
and you can start browsing the remote

3873
02:13:36,719 --> 02:13:38,239
instance what will happen in this case

3874
02:13:38,239 --> 02:13:38,880
is

3875
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:40,880
this will fetch the index of the remote

3876
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:42,800
instance and you can preview the data

3877
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:44,719
that they have you can also

3878
02:13:44,719 --> 02:13:46,880
look at each individual event and the

3879
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:48,880
idea here is that you first get a grasp

3880
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:50,719
of what sort of events you should expect

3881
02:13:50,719 --> 02:13:52,000
from the other side

3882
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:53,679
and and more importantly how they

3883
02:13:53,679 --> 02:13:55,599
contextualize the information so

3884
02:13:55,599 --> 02:13:57,040
if you see that they're using a certain

3885
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:59,840
taxonomy for describing certain types of

3886
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:02,400
data you might only be interested in a

3887
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:04,079
subset of the data set

3888
02:14:04,079 --> 02:14:05,760
so the moment that that happens you can

3889
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:07,760
use that as a synchronization filter

3890
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:09,199
we'll see that in a moment

3891
02:14:09,199 --> 02:14:10,960
and you can basically say okay i'm only

3892
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,320
interested for example

3893
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:14,320
in anything that has target information

3894
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:16,560
brazilian for example

3895
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:19,920
and then you only pull that data in

3896
02:14:20,079 --> 02:14:22,560
um there's a question here when i export

3897
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:24,239
an event in miss json format will the

3898
02:14:24,239 --> 02:14:25,920
report be in there yes the report should

3899
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:27,119
be in the json format

3900
02:14:27,119 --> 02:14:30,639
so just a quick reply to it

3901
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:36,880
now going back to the uh synchronization

3902
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:38,719
once you've seen the data setups remote

3903
02:14:38,719 --> 02:14:40,159
site you have basically several

3904
02:14:40,159 --> 02:14:41,920
decisions to make one do i pull

3905
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:44,880
all the data in two do i pull a part of

3906
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:45,920
the data in

3907
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:48,239
or three do i just manually pick

3908
02:14:48,239 --> 02:14:50,560
individual events that i want to ingest

3909
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:52,560
so all three are possible sometimes we

3910
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:55,040
mix and match several of these

3911
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:58,079
if i wanted to just enable pull

3912
02:14:58,079 --> 02:15:00,000
that's what alexa did so he has a pool

3913
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,119
flag enabled

3914
02:15:01,119 --> 02:15:03,440
in that case clicking pull all will just

3915
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:04,719
go to remote instance

3916
02:15:04,719 --> 02:15:07,040
fetch everything that they have be

3917
02:15:07,040 --> 02:15:07,760
careful

3918
02:15:07,760 --> 02:15:09,679
for example in the case of our private

3919
02:15:09,679 --> 02:15:11,280
sector instance that means

3920
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:13,760
nine years worth of our data that is a

3921
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:15,360
massive data set

3922
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:17,280
so you can add additional filters to

3923
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:19,599
further uh select parts of it so if we

3924
02:15:19,599 --> 02:15:20,800
edit that quickly

3925
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:24,000
and go to the pool filters

3926
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:28,719
there we go you can add additional

3927
02:15:28,719 --> 02:15:31,520
filters here either based on context so

3928
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:33,440
again this this helps with just looking

3929
02:15:33,440 --> 02:15:35,599
at what sort of tags the other side uses

3930
02:15:35,599 --> 02:15:37,360
and adding those is allowed or block

3931
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:38,639
tags selecting

3932
02:15:38,639 --> 02:15:40,400
data only from organizations or if you

3933
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:42,079
see that someone is noisy and generating

3934
02:15:42,079 --> 02:15:43,199
a lot of junk

3935
02:15:43,199 --> 02:15:44,960
you can also block that organization and

3936
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:46,400
synchronization link something else you

3937
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:47,119
can add

3938
02:15:47,119 --> 02:15:48,639
is you can add the timestamp in the

3939
02:15:48,639 --> 02:15:50,639
plurals so one of the things you can do

3940
02:15:50,639 --> 02:15:52,079
is you can say i'm only interested in

3941
02:15:52,079 --> 02:15:52,639
data

3942
02:15:52,639 --> 02:15:54,880
newer than say three months then i would

3943
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,880
add timestamp 90 days

3944
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:59,040
that will include any event that was

3945
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:02,000
created or modified in the past 90 days

3946
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,400
as an examples if you're wondering what

3947
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:06,159
sort of filters you can use there

3948
02:16:06,159 --> 02:16:07,920
it's using the same filtering mechanism

3949
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:09,440
as the event index

3950
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:11,199
so whenever you're on the event index

3951
02:16:11,199 --> 02:16:12,960
and adding filters that as we've seen

3952
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:13,599
yesterday

3953
02:16:13,599 --> 02:16:15,520
via that little magnifying glass

3954
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:17,280
anything that works there will also work

3955
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:19,040
here

3956
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:21,199
okay now for the cherry picking if you

3957
02:16:21,199 --> 02:16:22,960
decide to just pull individual events

3958
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:24,400
and instead of setting up rules and

3959
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:25,040
pulling

3960
02:16:25,040 --> 02:16:28,079
box sums of data you can just use the

3961
02:16:28,079 --> 02:16:29,199
preview view

3962
02:16:29,199 --> 02:16:31,199
to pick out individual events and say

3963
02:16:31,199 --> 02:16:32,638
download this event

3964
02:16:32,638 --> 02:16:33,840
and then it will just fetch that

3965
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:35,760
individual event for you

3966
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:38,959
now if you do that you still want to get

3967
02:16:38,959 --> 02:16:40,558
to update the data that you've already

3968
02:16:40,558 --> 02:16:42,558
pulled in one so keep in mind

3969
02:16:42,558 --> 02:16:44,799
any event in miss is a living document

3970
02:16:44,799 --> 02:16:45,599
that means it's

3971
02:16:45,599 --> 02:16:47,200
something that will get updated over

3972
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:49,519
time as new information comes in

3973
02:16:49,519 --> 02:16:52,718
as new contextualization gets added and

3974
02:16:52,718 --> 02:16:53,359
so on

3975
02:16:53,359 --> 02:16:54,638
so one of the things that you might want

3976
02:16:54,638 --> 02:16:56,558
to do is instead of just pulling in all

3977
02:16:56,558 --> 02:16:57,599
the data and

3978
02:16:57,599 --> 02:16:59,200
and fetching new data from the remote

3979
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:01,920
side just update what you already have

3980
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:05,120
and that's a little recycle button there

3981
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:08,080
that one will do that for you so that's

3982
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:10,398
basically it's very quickly about

3983
02:17:10,398 --> 02:17:12,718
the synchronization links any questions

3984
02:17:12,718 --> 02:17:14,398
to this part before we move on

3985
02:17:14,398 --> 02:17:15,760
because this was just a very quick

3986
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:17,840
explanation of how it works yeah

3987
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:20,558
maybe an additional one for the cache

3988
02:17:20,558 --> 02:17:22,879
caching

3989
02:17:22,879 --> 02:17:24,638
so um you can enable the caching

3990
02:17:24,638 --> 02:17:26,638
mechanism and this one is another

3991
02:17:26,638 --> 02:17:28,558
advantage so sometimes you have these

3992
02:17:28,558 --> 02:17:30,718
strategies that you don't want at all to

3993
02:17:30,718 --> 02:17:33,040
pull the event off of the mist instance

3994
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:35,120
but what you want to do is to pull

3995
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:37,359
only a cache of the value to get the

3996
02:17:37,359 --> 02:17:39,439
correlation so what it will do is

3997
02:17:39,439 --> 02:17:41,599
it will connect on the time stand pull

3998
02:17:41,599 --> 02:17:42,478
the

3999
02:17:42,478 --> 02:17:44,718
caching and store it in the caching

4000
02:17:44,718 --> 02:17:46,000
database

4001
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:47,599
so you won't see the event but when you

4002
02:17:47,599 --> 02:17:50,240
enter an event and with specific review

4003
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:52,318
that is matching the remote instance you

4004
02:17:52,318 --> 02:17:54,000
will see in the correlation

4005
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,920
so it's usually a way it's kind of

4006
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:57,280
balanced way where you

4007
02:17:57,280 --> 02:17:58,638
you have an interesting instance with

4008
02:17:58,638 --> 02:18:00,718
for example a lot of sandboxes

4009
02:18:00,718 --> 02:18:04,398
even data and then you pull this data

4010
02:18:04,398 --> 02:18:06,478
into your mist instance without having

4011
02:18:06,478 --> 02:18:08,398
all the data

4012
02:18:08,398 --> 02:18:10,718
and to do that uh you just have to go to

4013
02:18:10,718 --> 02:18:11,599
the parameters

4014
02:18:11,599 --> 02:18:15,120
of the connections and uh you can have

4015
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:16,398
just caching enable

4016
02:18:16,398 --> 02:18:19,920
so in this case you don't set pull and

4017
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:22,478
then you have a specific button there

4018
02:18:22,478 --> 02:18:23,679
for just caching

4019
02:18:23,679 --> 02:18:26,879
the specific uh value and that's that's

4020
02:18:26,879 --> 02:18:27,599
it

4021
02:18:27,599 --> 02:18:29,760
uh so you see it's quite versatile you

4022
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:31,840
have various ways of doing it so for the

4023
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:33,679
one that's already used taxi for example

4024
02:18:33,679 --> 02:18:34,000
and

4025
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,080
it's completely different uh it's just a

4026
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:37,920
matter of just adding the api key and

4027
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:38,478
then you

4028
02:18:38,478 --> 02:18:40,000
you set up whatever you like and you can

4029
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,519
synchronize and so on

4030
02:18:41,519 --> 02:18:44,240
same for push we saw the cool rules but

4031
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:45,760
we have push rules too

4032
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:47,920
so if we just want to share information

4033
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:49,040
we enable push

4034
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:50,840
and then you decide what you want to

4035
02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:53,280
push there

4036
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:58,318
okay so that's basically it for the

4037
02:18:58,318 --> 02:18:59,280
synchronization part

4038
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:01,040
and answer questions we can look at the

4039
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:02,638
feeds um

4040
02:19:02,638 --> 02:19:06,160
next though yeah just this one is

4041
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:08,879
we were discussing about it so uh um the

4042
02:19:08,879 --> 02:19:10,638
the guys from the uh

4043
02:19:10,638 --> 02:19:13,760
open gti uh uh sharing community in

4044
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:15,679
brazil uh for example wanted to be

4045
02:19:15,679 --> 02:19:18,318
listed is that community index

4046
02:19:18,318 --> 02:19:20,000
there it's a json file so you can

4047
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,599
contribute the repository and it will

4048
02:19:21,599 --> 02:19:23,439
end up into the default

4049
02:19:23,439 --> 02:19:26,718
uh default uh the follower committee if

4050
02:19:26,718 --> 02:19:29,040
there is it's just a directory uh and

4051
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:30,959
then you decide uh so you see that

4052
02:19:30,959 --> 02:19:32,879
if you have self registration you can

4053
02:19:32,879 --> 02:19:35,040
already self register on the instance

4054
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:37,679
and if you want you can even get in

4055
02:19:37,679 --> 02:19:39,599
touch with the owner of this uh

4056
02:19:39,599 --> 02:19:43,840
instance to get access to it and

4057
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:46,160
being able to get in touch with them and

4058
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:47,200
connect to your

4059
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:49,840
to that community

4060
02:19:53,359 --> 02:19:56,000
okay so again yeah just let us know if

4061
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,960
you want to get listed there

4062
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:02,080
so let's look at the feeds so

4063
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:04,000
initially the first thing that we had in

4064
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,160
terms of interconnectivity with ms

4065
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:08,800
was the synchronization which has

4066
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:10,319
improved a lot over time but it's

4067
02:20:10,319 --> 02:20:11,920
essentially doing the same thing as it

4068
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:14,240
did back in 2014

4069
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:16,800
which is just exchanging information

4070
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:18,720
between miss princesses

4071
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:20,640
now sometimes we get some weird

4072
02:20:20,640 --> 02:20:24,160
questions about how can we solve

4073
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:26,000
or how can you implement any information

4074
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,280
exchange between say two air gap systems

4075
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:32,479
or two systems that are not on the same

4076
02:20:32,479 --> 02:20:34,640
network or anything like that

4077
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:36,240
and one of the things that we ended up

4078
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:38,399
building for misp is a feed system

4079
02:20:38,399 --> 02:20:40,399
where you can generate feeds out of your

4080
02:20:40,399 --> 02:20:42,479
west pencins

4081
02:20:42,479 --> 02:20:43,920
meaning that you can set up certain

4082
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:46,319
rules include anything that is tagged or

4083
02:20:46,319 --> 02:20:46,720
synth

4084
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:49,520
anything that is stacked tlp white and

4085
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:52,319
then basically

4086
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:56,640
use that to generate a fee there is a

4087
02:20:56,640 --> 02:20:57,840
question by the way i'm having a very

4088
02:20:57,840 --> 02:20:59,280
high response time for the training

4089
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:00,000
server

4090
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,760
more than two minutes off this is very

4091
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:03,920
low that's very long

4092
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:06,399
i mean i don't know how heavy the load

4093
02:21:06,399 --> 02:21:09,200
is we're quite a few participants and uh

4094
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:11,280
and this instance is really under

4095
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:13,120
provision so it's running on two gigs of

4096
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:14,960
memory all together so

4097
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:17,840
why it seems to have something here okay

4098
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:18,560
that's weird

4099
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:21,439
uh maybe it's an api query or something

4100
02:21:21,439 --> 02:21:23,520
that is being still

4101
02:21:23,520 --> 02:21:25,359
great it's a really under provisioned

4102
02:21:25,359 --> 02:21:28,000
instance as well

4103
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,479
anyway for the feats themselves we can

4104
02:21:30,479 --> 02:21:32,319
generate these feeds that can then be

4105
02:21:32,319 --> 02:21:35,760
shared via flash drive by a web server

4106
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:37,760
and basically outside of the misdomester

4107
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:38,800
exchange

4108
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:40,240
one of the things that we use it for

4109
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:42,240
ourselves is we we host our

4110
02:21:42,240 --> 02:21:45,280
os in feed on a publicly available

4111
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:46,080
server

4112
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:48,880
and we generate that using misfit

4113
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:50,720
generator so here's an example what the

4114
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:52,240
outcome of that looks like

4115
02:21:52,240 --> 02:21:54,800
so it's just a bunch of json files each

4116
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:57,280
denoting one event

4117
02:21:57,280 --> 02:21:58,960
on the very end of the list we have two

4118
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:01,600
special files called manifest.json

4119
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:05,680
and hashes.csv the first one is used to

4120
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:06,160
generate

4121
02:22:06,160 --> 02:22:09,439
index and the second is used for the uh

4122
02:22:09,439 --> 02:22:11,840
for caching the remote side so these are

4123
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:13,600
all generated by the feed generator we

4124
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:14,720
can generate this

4125
02:22:14,720 --> 02:22:17,439
say every few hours and then just throw

4126
02:22:17,439 --> 02:22:19,120
it in a web server and make it available

4127
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:20,479
to a wide audience

4128
02:22:20,479 --> 02:22:22,080
so what this looks like in misp if we go

4129
02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:24,240
back to our feed browser we can interact

4130
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:25,840
with it the exact same way as you would

4131
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:27,359
with the message server

4132
02:22:27,359 --> 02:22:29,359
so we can preview the data we can create

4133
02:22:29,359 --> 02:22:32,000
synchronization rules to pull data in

4134
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,160
and we can preview each individual event

4135
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:36,000
decide to cherry pick data that you want

4136
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,040
and so on

4137
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:40,319
so it's really powerful it allows you to

4138
02:22:40,319 --> 02:22:42,080
interact with it exactly the same way

4139
02:22:42,080 --> 02:22:43,920
and that's interesting

4140
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:47,840
we have some feed filters set up

4141
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:51,840
wow

4142
02:22:52,720 --> 02:22:54,000
[Music]

4143
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:58,319
was it you nope that wasn't wasn't me

4144
02:22:58,319 --> 02:23:02,160
okay so so basically the idea is that it

4145
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:04,080
works the same way and then you can

4146
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:05,280
share to many

4147
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:07,200
organizations in one shot a lot of feed

4148
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:09,280
providers will share

4149
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:11,920
feeds with with your miss this way where

4150
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:14,000
they give you a url they give you an api

4151
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:15,840
key that you need to pass the header

4152
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:17,680
and then you can fetch the data in your

4153
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:20,240
miss directly through the feed

4154
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:23,040
so this is a really easy way to get an

4155
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:23,920
alternate way of

4156
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:27,359
exchanging information okay

4157
02:23:27,359 --> 02:23:29,359
so here it is you can preview the data

4158
02:23:29,359 --> 02:23:31,120
the same way pull the data in

4159
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:34,720
and so on okay

4160
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:37,600
uh yes that's a very good question can

4161
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:39,120
we search into the remote miss

4162
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:40,960
without pulling its data perhaps we can

4163
02:23:40,960 --> 02:23:42,560
we can show i don't know if it's

4164
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:43,920
if i've pulled anything in there now

4165
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:45,920
there i didn't but okay we can explain

4166
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:47,120
how this works

4167
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:48,800
so instead of setting pool when you're

4168
02:23:48,800 --> 02:23:50,160
setting up a connection to the other

4169
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:51,680
instance what you can do is you can set

4170
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:51,920
up

4171
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:54,399
the caching and then each time you cache

4172
02:23:54,399 --> 02:23:56,479
the remote instance it will generate a

4173
02:23:56,479 --> 02:23:59,040
local lookup database for the remote

4174
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:01,040
it will only include hashes of all of

4175
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:02,720
the values on the remote side

4176
02:24:02,720 --> 02:24:04,880
and that allows you to search all your

4177
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:06,640
your cached sources remotely so if you

4178
02:24:06,640 --> 02:24:08,800
go to sync actions

4179
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:11,199
on top

4180
02:24:12,560 --> 02:24:14,399
oh yeah you're here already sorry i

4181
02:24:14,399 --> 02:24:15,760
missed that

4182
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:17,200
so you're in the feed cache search the

4183
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:19,840
sync actions uh search feed caches

4184
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:22,240
this includes all cache servers and all

4185
02:24:22,240 --> 02:24:23,359
cached feeds

4186
02:24:23,359 --> 02:24:25,359
so if you search for a value it will

4187
02:24:25,359 --> 02:24:27,040
search all those different sources

4188
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:29,840
so in this case

4189
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:33,920
okay

4190
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:41,040
maybe the idea yeah that could be indeed

4191
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:43,680
but uh but you you use the same way

4192
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:46,000
basically to search remote uh servers as

4193
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,560
well for values

4194
02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:50,479
and what we do with this for example is

4195
02:24:50,479 --> 02:24:51,840
we have all those collecting

4196
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:53,359
collection missed instances that we

4197
02:24:53,359 --> 02:24:54,880
mentioned before

4198
02:24:54,880 --> 02:24:56,720
we definitely don't pull that data into

4199
02:24:56,720 --> 02:24:58,880
operational instances we just cache them

4200
02:24:58,880 --> 02:25:00,479
and then we can remotely search for the

4201
02:25:00,479 --> 02:25:02,479
data

4202
02:25:02,479 --> 02:25:05,359
now keep in mind um that's one of the

4203
02:25:05,359 --> 02:25:06,720
advantages of this is

4204
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:08,319
if you're searching this way instead of

4205
02:25:08,319 --> 02:25:09,840
directly going out to the other instance

4206
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:10,479
and searching

4207
02:25:10,479 --> 02:25:12,640
for instance directly is that the

4208
02:25:12,640 --> 02:25:15,200
searches still happen on your server

4209
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:16,960
so you're searching locally against the

4210
02:25:16,960 --> 02:25:18,160
caches meaning that you're not

4211
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:19,920
disclosing what you're searching for to

4212
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:21,120
your partners

4213
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:24,160
so that has that added benefit as well

4214
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:26,160
so something else we can perhaps we can

4215
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:27,840
now talk about that as well while we're

4216
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:28,880
here

4217
02:25:28,880 --> 02:25:30,560
with the feed overlap matrix what else

4218
02:25:30,560 --> 02:25:32,160
we can use this for

4219
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:34,880
uh so once you generate those caches on

4220
02:25:34,880 --> 02:25:35,600
other feeds

4221
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:37,200
you can basically use it for a bunch of

4222
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:38,720
other stuff too what you can do is you

4223
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:40,720
can compare your data sources

4224
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:43,200
and overlap data that they have this

4225
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:44,560
might be a bit heavy for this instance

4226
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:46,560
there we go

4227
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:47,920
so what we have here is we have a bunch

4228
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:49,760
of cached feeds and we can check

4229
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:51,200
how large you overlap between the

4230
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:53,600
different sources are

4231
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:55,359
so we see there for example that between

4232
02:25:55,359 --> 02:25:56,720
the open fish

4233
02:25:56,720 --> 02:26:00,720
url list and what is the other one

4234
02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:03,760
and fish tank there is a 28 overlap of

4235
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:04,640
the data

4236
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:06,160
what we can do with this as well is we

4237
02:26:06,160 --> 02:26:07,920
can investigate individual feeds so in

4238
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:09,840
this case if we click on open fish

4239
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:11,520
but that one is only covered by one

4240
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:13,359
source so maybe not the best example but

4241
02:26:13,359 --> 02:26:16,000
perhaps the torah exit nodes one is nice

4242
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:17,680
that has an overlap with quite a few

4243
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:19,359
other ones

4244
02:26:19,359 --> 02:26:21,840
so here we can for example see the

4245
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:23,760
coverage that we can get with certain

4246
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:25,760
other feeds

4247
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:28,640
that we combine so what we can say here

4248
02:26:28,640 --> 02:26:30,840
for example is we're interested okay

4249
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:34,880
46.81 of this feed is covered by the

4250
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:36,720
the combined set of all the other fees

4251
02:26:36,720 --> 02:26:38,000
that we've ingested

4252
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,359
but let's see what this would look like

4253
02:26:39,359 --> 02:26:42,080
if we exclude certain uh

4254
02:26:42,080 --> 02:26:44,319
certain ones from the list so here we

4255
02:26:44,319 --> 02:26:45,600
excluded those two

4256
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:48,640
uh feeds and we check the coverage

4257
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:49,680
without those

4258
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:52,560
so even though we exclude the 30 uh

4259
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:54,240
coverage feed we did we did not have a

4260
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:54,800
30

4261
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:56,640
drop so there is apparently quite a bit

4262
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:58,080
of overlap between them

4263
02:26:58,080 --> 02:26:59,520
the thing that you can use this for is

4264
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:00,960
ask for a proof of concept from your

4265
02:27:00,960 --> 02:27:02,319
feed vendors

4266
02:27:02,319 --> 02:27:04,800
just pull all the data into a into a

4267
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:06,560
fresh misp instance

4268
02:27:06,560 --> 02:27:09,200
from all those vendors and and all those

4269
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:11,359
feeds include all your osm feeds and so

4270
02:27:11,359 --> 02:27:12,000
on

4271
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:13,840
and then see what you can cover with

4272
02:27:13,840 --> 02:27:15,280
your osm data

4273
02:27:15,280 --> 02:27:16,560
perhaps with the feeds that you have

4274
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:19,200
subscribers uh subscribe to already

4275
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:20,880
and see which of the the feeds would

4276
02:27:20,880 --> 02:27:22,640
give you the most of new data that you

4277
02:27:22,640 --> 02:27:24,479
don't have with your current data set

4278
02:27:24,479 --> 02:27:26,880
again this is a first set evaluation

4279
02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:28,479
just knowing that the value exists in a

4280
02:27:28,479 --> 02:27:29,200
feed doesn't

4281
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:30,720
tell you about the quality of the feed

4282
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:33,040
how well the data is contextualized

4283
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:36,479
whether the data gets uh gets

4284
02:27:36,479 --> 02:27:39,280
the data in a more timely fashion than

4285
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:40,319
the other feeds

4286
02:27:40,319 --> 02:27:42,080
so it's just the first step of

4287
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:44,960
investigating which feeds to

4288
02:27:44,960 --> 02:27:47,040
invest in but it's it's a pretty handy

4289
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:49,040
tool for that

4290
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:52,240
there's a question regarding the caching

4291
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:55,760
yeah yeah so

4292
02:27:55,760 --> 02:27:57,120
when do you enable it i mean whenever

4293
02:27:57,120 --> 02:28:00,640
you add add a feed or or a server

4294
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:02,319
you generally make the decision what you

4295
02:28:02,319 --> 02:28:04,800
do with it so if you we look at the

4296
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:08,640
editing of of the settings of the feed

4297
02:28:08,640 --> 02:28:10,240
you see there that you tell miss what

4298
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:11,920
sort of a strategy you want to use with

4299
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:12,720
this feed

4300
02:28:12,720 --> 02:28:14,560
enable means that you will pull the data

4301
02:28:14,560 --> 02:28:16,960
in when you start the fetch process

4302
02:28:16,960 --> 02:28:19,040
and caching says that you start a cache

4303
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:20,000
process

4304
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,600
or this will be including the caching

4305
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:23,920
process once you've enabled the feeds

4306
02:28:23,920 --> 02:28:24,479
that you

4307
02:28:24,479 --> 02:28:26,720
that you want for in air for pulling and

4308
02:28:26,720 --> 02:28:29,040
caching then it's a matter of actually

4309
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:32,080
executing a cache and executing a pull

4310
02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:35,120
uh command in misp so those are

4311
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:36,560
available up there

4312
02:28:36,560 --> 02:28:38,720
with those buttons or alternatively you

4313
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:39,680
can

4314
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:41,920
use cli commands to run those and then

4315
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:43,439
you can put in a crown job and pull

4316
02:28:43,439 --> 02:28:46,640
every 15 minutes or something

4317
02:28:49,439 --> 02:28:51,600
if you touch on the advanced feed

4318
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:53,520
caching options where we can use a time

4319
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:54,560
frame

4320
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:58,640
uh i am not entirely sure understand

4321
02:28:58,640 --> 02:29:00,880
that

4322
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:06,160
mechanism we cannot set a time frame

4323
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:08,080
for servers yes for feeds which we

4324
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:09,520
cannot set time frame because

4325
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:11,200
the hand is actually a good point we

4326
02:29:11,200 --> 02:29:13,040
should play is a good place

4327
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:15,920
yes for the missed one we could do that

4328
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:17,130
um

4329
02:29:17,130 --> 02:29:18,319
[Music]

4330
02:29:18,319 --> 02:29:21,359
we have it oh no okay

4331
02:29:21,359 --> 02:29:23,840
let's get to it you can you can do it

4332
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:24,800
for the one

4333
02:29:24,800 --> 02:29:28,399
time format

4334
02:29:28,399 --> 02:29:31,359
um but you cannot do it for the generic

4335
02:29:31,359 --> 02:29:34,240
one which is csv

4336
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:36,880
yeah with this one you can absolutely do

4337
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:37,920
that uh

4338
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:40,560
indeed uh to just fetch data for a

4339
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:42,160
certain time frame i i

4340
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:44,479
completely forgot we had that four feet

4341
02:29:44,479 --> 02:29:45,920
that's nice to know

4342
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:48,160
uh keep in mind this will only work for

4343
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:49,760
feeds in the mist format if you have a

4344
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:50,000
no

4345
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:51,680
synth feed or something like that it's

4346
02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:53,280
just a csv

4347
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:56,720
or just a flat list of values we don't

4348
02:29:56,720 --> 02:29:59,040
have timed timestamps for the values

4349
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:01,040
there so there it doesn't work

4350
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:02,560
but if something is properly formatted

4351
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:04,800
in this format misformat effects and

4352
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:07,120
there you can do it for example if you

4353
02:30:07,120 --> 02:30:10,240
assume intel's 471 is providing in the

4354
02:30:10,240 --> 02:30:13,359
format fee then you you just have like

4355
02:30:13,359 --> 02:30:14,000
this

4356
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,640
this feed the access and you might have

4357
02:30:16,640 --> 02:30:18,479
authorization and so on and access but

4358
02:30:18,479 --> 02:30:20,080
besides that you can just specify the

4359
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:21,760
filter we'll say i want just like the

4360
02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:22,319
last

4361
02:30:22,319 --> 02:30:33,840
six days for example

4362
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:37,520
yeah i said no question no you just

4363
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:39,359
answered them okay

4364
02:30:39,359 --> 02:30:42,960
yeah just pop-ups okay

4365
02:30:42,960 --> 02:30:44,960
so that's basically it for the feeds and

4366
02:30:44,960 --> 02:30:46,720
we didn't really talk about text and csv

4367
02:30:46,720 --> 02:30:48,000
feeds perhaps quickly let's touch up

4368
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:49,439
those as well

4369
02:30:49,439 --> 02:30:52,720
so obviously if you have a csv or flat

4370
02:30:52,720 --> 02:30:54,640
list feeds out there that you want to

4371
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:55,280
ingest

4372
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:57,359
you can do that too so there are a bunch

4373
02:30:57,359 --> 02:30:58,880
of those feeds pre-configured

4374
02:30:58,880 --> 02:31:02,319
in miss that we curate

4375
02:31:02,319 --> 02:31:06,160
so in that case uh you see we have three

4376
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:07,439
parsing options mis

4377
02:31:07,439 --> 02:31:09,200
feeds are for those that are dropped by

4378
02:31:09,200 --> 02:31:11,760
this one generated by misp

4379
02:31:11,760 --> 02:31:13,840
free text sparse feed feeds will

4380
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:16,000
basically use the free text import tool

4381
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:17,280
so the one that we've seen the other day

4382
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:18,430
where it just goes to

4383
02:31:18,430 --> 02:31:21,280
[Music]

4384
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:22,960
grabs all the data from a feed and it

4385
02:31:22,960 --> 02:31:24,880
just parts out indicators from the feed

4386
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:26,960
and generates the data from that

4387
02:31:26,960 --> 02:31:30,000
and simple csv parse feed

4388
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,399
is using the same logic but uh how it

4389
02:31:32,399 --> 02:31:34,080
breaks apart the text

4390
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:36,240
and which of the columns to actually

4391
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:37,200
inspect is it

4392
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:39,920
depends on your configuration yes there

4393
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:41,760
is a public list of all these feeds when

4394
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:42,880
you install misp

4395
02:31:42,880 --> 02:31:44,560
there is a button on top of the feed

4396
02:31:44,560 --> 02:31:48,160
list uh so if you look at the feed index

4397
02:31:48,160 --> 02:31:49,760
and there is something like a low

4398
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:51,600
default feedback

4399
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:53,600
yeah that will grab everything that you

4400
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:55,120
see here is then

4401
02:31:55,120 --> 02:31:56,880
generated and inserted into your

4402
02:31:56,880 --> 02:31:58,640
instance but they're not enabled

4403
02:31:58,640 --> 02:32:00,240
so you still need to enable them at that

4404
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:01,840
point uh so we just provide the

4405
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:03,359
configurations for them

4406
02:32:03,359 --> 02:32:04,800
and then it's up to you to enable them

4407
02:32:04,800 --> 02:32:06,640
or not you can obviously also add your

4408
02:32:06,640 --> 02:32:07,840
own so

4409
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:10,960
so this is just a same default list of

4410
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:13,120
all seat feeds

4411
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:15,200
something else that is interesting if

4412
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:17,040
you go through the effort of encoding

4413
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:17,520
feeds

4414
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:19,520
and adding your own feeds there is a way

4415
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:20,880
to export the

4416
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:23,120
configuration settings for the feed so

4417
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:24,000
you can

4418
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,399
if you just show an example here of any

4419
02:32:26,399 --> 02:32:27,760
of the existing ones what it actually

4420
02:32:27,760 --> 02:32:28,960
looks like

4421
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:30,080
on the right side you have a little

4422
02:32:30,080 --> 02:32:32,319
cloud icon and if you click on that it

4423
02:32:32,319 --> 02:32:33,760
will download

4424
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:35,760
the metadata of how to configure this

4425
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:37,439
feed and then you can share it with your

4426
02:32:37,439 --> 02:32:39,280
other internal instances share it with

4427
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:40,720
your peers and so on

4428
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:42,080
and then and then if you found a good

4429
02:32:42,080 --> 02:32:44,319
feed set up the configuration you can

4430
02:32:44,319 --> 02:32:45,600
share this with them and they can ingest

4431
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:47,680
it

4432
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:49,520
okay we have some default one and i mean

4433
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:51,120
if you want to add some

4434
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:54,080
feel free recently we had for example

4435
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:56,160
the one from abu ch

4436
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:57,760
for the new project and they are

4437
02:32:57,760 --> 02:32:59,200
providing uh

4438
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:01,520
them in miss format directly so so if

4439
02:33:01,520 --> 02:33:03,200
you see an interesting feed and you want

4440
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:04,640
to share it with others or you are

4441
02:33:04,640 --> 02:33:07,040
producing an interesting feat

4442
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:09,120
just make a cool request on the json

4443
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:10,399
files and then we will add it in the

4444
02:33:10,399 --> 02:33:11,120
default

4445
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:14,960
step and that's a good question

4446
02:33:14,960 --> 02:33:17,120
we don't have we cannot do that so

4447
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:19,040
that's something we should add indeed

4448
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:20,720
to be able to filter out by type that

4449
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:22,160
you only want certain types there so

4450
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:22,800
perhaps

4451
02:33:22,800 --> 02:33:24,240
you could have issue for us for this

4452
02:33:24,240 --> 02:33:26,160
yeah yeah

4453
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:29,600
yeah yeah should i will do

4454
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:31,520
yeah i'll do it i'll do it so you don't

4455
02:33:31,520 --> 02:33:35,280
need to switch the screen

4456
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:49,840
yeah it makes sense it's a good point

4457
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:55,200
okay there are some questions uh yeah so

4458
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:58,560
the the one about the old feed

4459
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:00,960
indeed so if you miss format you can

4460
02:34:00,960 --> 02:34:02,560
filter out the time so that means you

4461
02:34:02,560 --> 02:34:03,280
can just like

4462
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:06,000
say okay it's many times but clearly for

4463
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:06,960
the csv

4464
02:34:06,960 --> 02:34:09,359
especially there's a lot of csv i have

4465
02:34:09,359 --> 02:34:10,000
not

4466
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,640
a times time stamp or stuff like that

4467
02:34:12,640 --> 02:34:13,680
it's more difficult

4468
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:15,359
but if there are misformatives yes you

4469
02:34:15,359 --> 02:34:18,160
can do it and you can filter out by

4470
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:21,439
the specific time frame

4471
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:25,200
so just a question there about

4472
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:26,720
integration with the hive

4473
02:34:26,720 --> 02:34:28,240
is there a way to automatically publish

4474
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:29,840
events that are exported from the hive

4475
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:31,680
iocs already work and just need to be

4476
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:32,640
published

4477
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:34,319
that's a good question i thought they

4478
02:34:34,319 --> 02:34:35,920
would get automatically published when

4479
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:37,600
they get pushed from the hive

4480
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:41,680
yeah yeah you have an option

4481
02:34:42,800 --> 02:34:45,200
so when you you have an election in the

4482
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:46,640
ice you can set uh if it's

4483
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:48,190
published or not um

4484
02:34:48,190 --> 02:34:49,760
[Music]

4485
02:34:49,760 --> 02:34:51,359
there's another one about the time frame

4486
02:34:51,359 --> 02:34:52,720
can you just show quickly how to edit

4487
02:34:52,720 --> 02:34:54,000
and add the time frame from

4488
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:58,399
for yeah yeah so

4489
02:35:09,359 --> 02:35:14,319
and then for example i'm adding

4490
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:17,199
time stamp

4491
02:35:18,800 --> 02:35:21,680
and i want the last six days for example

4492
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:24,160
you just like and you can express so

4493
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:25,840
i think on the responsion it's just like

4494
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:27,920
the timestamp in the rest api

4495
02:35:27,920 --> 02:35:30,160
um if you're on the last six days um you

4496
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:31,200
can even expect in

4497
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:34,319
all hours if i'm not misleading uh yeah

4498
02:35:34,319 --> 02:35:35,040
exactly

4499
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:37,040
you can also use actual timestamps

4500
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:38,960
instead of saying six hours and so on

4501
02:35:38,960 --> 02:35:39,520
and you can have

4502
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:41,359
your range and you can do stuff like

4503
02:35:41,359 --> 02:35:42,960
that too so yeah but you can

4504
02:35:42,960 --> 02:35:44,640
also do a range so it can be a list with

4505
02:35:44,640 --> 02:35:46,160
two values and and

4506
02:35:46,160 --> 02:35:50,000
then it's really a range um so oops

4507
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:53,200
yeah exactly so you you can do something

4508
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:53,520
like

4509
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:55,680
six days to three or ten days to nine

4510
02:35:55,680 --> 02:35:57,040
days ago for example

4511
02:35:57,040 --> 02:35:59,920
or something like that or two specific

4512
02:35:59,920 --> 02:36:01,600
time stamps for a

4513
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:04,640
start and end time as well so it's quite

4514
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:08,720
flexible with that

4515
02:36:08,720 --> 02:36:12,240
okay it's answer the question

4516
02:36:14,160 --> 02:36:16,960
what else do we have questions uh

4517
02:36:16,960 --> 02:36:18,319
there's another question um

4518
02:36:18,319 --> 02:36:19,920
if i want to use the feeds for example

4519
02:36:19,920 --> 02:36:21,520
correlation with my events search in the

4520
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:22,000
feeds

4521
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:23,280
then i need to catch the feeds yes

4522
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:25,280
correct so

4523
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:27,200
if you just add the feed you either need

4524
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:29,280
to fetch it and to tell miss to

4525
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:30,960
download the data of the feed and create

4526
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:33,359
events locally or alternatively cache

4527
02:36:33,359 --> 02:36:35,200
them once you do either of those two you

4528
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:36,800
will get correlations here on data and

4529
02:36:36,800 --> 02:36:38,080
you can search them

4530
02:36:38,080 --> 02:36:40,800
yeah and if you you pull a csv and you

4531
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:42,479
cache the timestamp that you can use is

4532
02:36:42,479 --> 02:36:44,399
a time stamp for the publication

4533
02:36:44,399 --> 02:36:45,760
because you basically have a timestamp

4534
02:36:45,760 --> 02:36:49,120
which is the one when you import the fit

4535
02:36:49,120 --> 02:36:50,800
sometimes when you have for example feet

4536
02:36:50,800 --> 02:36:53,040
with no timestamp you can use the import

4537
02:36:53,040 --> 02:36:53,760
timestamp

4538
02:36:53,760 --> 02:37:05,840
of this

4539
02:37:06,080 --> 02:37:07,760
let's quickly reply to the other one uh

4540
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:09,439
so there was another question and then

4541
02:37:09,439 --> 02:37:11,600
and do you need to cache uh the feed in

4542
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:13,120
order to be able to set the timestamp

4543
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:13,760
frames

4544
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:16,240
no you don't you can just set it and

4545
02:37:16,240 --> 02:37:18,080
just fetch the data

4546
02:37:18,080 --> 02:37:19,680
in fact i'm not entirely sure it will

4547
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:21,760
work for the caching so it works for

4548
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:22,800
fetching the data

4549
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:24,640
but i think for caching you cannot set a

4550
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:26,399
time frame so there it will cache the

4551
02:37:26,399 --> 02:37:28,240
entire data statuses

4552
02:37:28,240 --> 02:37:29,760
and yeah because it's the value that

4553
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:33,280
discusses yeah exactly exactly

4554
02:37:33,280 --> 02:37:35,520
it's more more generic on the other in

4555
02:37:35,520 --> 02:37:37,520
on the other way it's not like a big

4556
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:38,399
deal because you don't

4557
02:37:38,399 --> 02:37:40,560
get that much information it's just the

4558
02:37:40,560 --> 02:37:47,840
value the hash value

4559
02:37:51,760 --> 02:37:55,600
it should be the case um

4560
02:37:55,680 --> 02:37:56,800
we can we can have a look at the

4561
02:37:56,800 --> 02:37:58,960
documentation later if you want but

4562
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:00,960
i'm pretty sure there's an option to

4563
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:02,560
publish

4564
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:06,800
after you push the obesity event

4565
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:12,080
okay so caching and fetching yeah i know

4566
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:14,080
sometimes it's confusing to about

4567
02:38:14,080 --> 02:38:14,800
caching

4568
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:16,640
and fetching so really you have to see

4569
02:38:16,640 --> 02:38:19,040
it in that way caching is basically

4570
02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:20,479
just getting the value and putting in

4571
02:38:20,479 --> 02:38:22,479
the cache to have it in the correlation

4572
02:38:22,479 --> 02:38:25,520
fetching is basically getting all data

4573
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:27,280
uh maybe with the time frame and so on

4574
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:29,200
and it sucks in

4575
02:38:29,200 --> 02:38:32,399
ingesting it into your mix either

4576
02:38:32,399 --> 02:38:34,319
be just super careful you have two

4577
02:38:34,319 --> 02:38:36,800
options when you ingest feeds

4578
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:39,439
you can always use the same fixed event

4579
02:38:39,439 --> 02:38:41,600
which is the default nowadays

4580
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:43,359
but sometimes you want to create a new

4581
02:38:43,359 --> 02:38:45,280
event be super careful on that one

4582
02:38:45,280 --> 02:38:45,680
because

4583
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:47,680
if you try it each time a new event that

4584
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:49,520
we import for example on a daily basis a

4585
02:38:49,520 --> 02:38:50,160
csv

4586
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:52,319
which is always the same you will get a

4587
02:38:52,319 --> 02:38:53,439
lot of

4588
02:38:53,439 --> 02:38:55,359
duplicates even with the same value and

4589
02:38:55,359 --> 02:38:56,800
with a lot of correlations

4590
02:38:56,800 --> 02:38:59,280
which is like super intensive so if you

4591
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:01,040
really want to kill a missed instance

4592
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:03,600
uh it's to do that but there are some

4593
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:05,359
use cases where you want to import

4594
02:39:05,359 --> 02:39:07,760
on a regular event but usually you want

4595
02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:09,040
to use a fixed event

4596
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:12,160
and you do a delta merge

4597
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:20,479
i'm not sure

4598
02:39:22,399 --> 02:39:24,560
yeah no i would always use english i

4599
02:39:24,560 --> 02:39:26,319
mean it depends really if you know that

4600
02:39:26,319 --> 02:39:27,280
you will never

4601
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:30,399
uh share the information with uh

4602
02:39:30,399 --> 02:39:33,920
outside of your national boundaries and

4603
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:34,960
so on

4604
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:37,600
then by all means use whatever language

4605
02:39:37,600 --> 02:39:39,680
but but it's really inconvenient for

4606
02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:40,720
example for us as

4607
02:39:40,720 --> 02:39:43,359
circle if we get uh data in different

4608
02:39:43,359 --> 02:39:44,960
languages then we don't really know how

4609
02:39:44,960 --> 02:39:46,080
to deal with it

4610
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:48,640
so it's really english is preferred just

4611
02:39:48,640 --> 02:39:50,240
for that reason but other than that it's

4612
02:39:50,240 --> 02:39:51,680
really up to you and it really depends

4613
02:39:51,680 --> 02:39:52,880
on who you're going to share

4614
02:39:52,880 --> 02:39:55,359
with yeah so for example we have some

4615
02:39:55,359 --> 02:39:56,399
japanese users

4616
02:39:56,399 --> 02:39:58,720
sharing with us uh japanese uh

4617
02:39:58,720 --> 02:40:00,160
spearfishing and so on

4618
02:40:00,160 --> 02:40:01,600
but what they do everything is in

4619
02:40:01,600 --> 02:40:04,000
japanese where they use common tags so

4620
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
we can still filter out

4621
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,399
so and we are fine to receive those were

4622
02:40:08,399 --> 02:40:09,680
in japanese

4623
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:12,160
yeah indeed

4624
02:40:14,240 --> 02:40:17,840
but not even yeah that's kind of correct

4625
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:19,520
so so the caching what it will do it

4626
02:40:19,520 --> 02:40:20,640
really is

4627
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:22,560
uh it simply goes to the source be the

4628
02:40:22,560 --> 02:40:24,319
feedback and so on

4629
02:40:24,319 --> 02:40:26,240
it fetches all the values it hashes all

4630
02:40:26,240 --> 02:40:27,680
of them and it puts it into a fast

4631
02:40:27,680 --> 02:40:29,279
lookup database that means that whenever

4632
02:40:29,279 --> 02:40:30,640
we do it directly

4633
02:40:30,640 --> 02:40:32,720
a search for it if it's a direct string

4634
02:40:32,720 --> 02:40:35,040
match we see immediately it's contained

4635
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:36,720
the only metadata that we include with

4636
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:38,240
it is really the source

4637
02:40:38,240 --> 02:40:39,840
and if it's a missed style feed or a

4638
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:42,160
missed server then also the reference to

4639
02:40:42,160 --> 02:40:44,479
the event that we can pivot to

4640
02:40:44,479 --> 02:40:45,840
so the idea is that if we get a

4641
02:40:45,840 --> 02:40:48,319
correlation to a feed we can

4642
02:40:48,319 --> 02:40:50,160
directly pivot to the preview of the

4643
02:40:50,160 --> 02:40:52,000
event on the remote side and see through

4644
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:53,359
data

4645
02:40:53,359 --> 02:40:55,439
for the fetching it's a different story

4646
02:40:55,439 --> 02:40:57,520
if you fetch the data

4647
02:40:57,520 --> 02:40:59,520
this will download the full data set as

4648
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:02,800
is and create local events out of it

4649
02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:06,000
yeah i i just created an event um with

4650
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:07,600
an attribute value that is

4651
02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:09,920
correlating but also in the feed and you

4652
02:41:09,920 --> 02:41:11,279
see the

4653
02:41:11,279 --> 02:41:14,880
reference in the cache

4654
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:16,640
yeah and if you go to the reference it

4655
02:41:16,640 --> 02:41:18,720
should take you to the preview of the

4656
02:41:18,720 --> 02:41:21,840
actual event on on the feed yeah there

4657
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:22,560
it is

4658
02:41:22,560 --> 02:41:24,479
so there you see the actual event that

4659
02:41:24,479 --> 02:41:25,840
correlates on the other side

4660
02:41:25,840 --> 02:41:27,840
now when you're making the decision

4661
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:30,000
should i fetch a date or should i

4662
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,319
just cache the data keep in mind that

4663
02:41:32,319 --> 02:41:33,439
only data you fetch

4664
02:41:33,439 --> 02:41:35,359
can be used for example to generate

4665
02:41:35,359 --> 02:41:37,040
detection rules out of it

4666
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:38,800
so if you if you know that it's it says

4667
02:41:38,800 --> 02:41:40,720
that it's relevant enough for you to use

4668
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:42,720
directly in your operational data set

4669
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:44,560
then fetch it because then you have it

4670
02:41:44,560 --> 02:41:45,920
on your local instance it can be

4671
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:48,399
converted to all different ids rules all

4672
02:41:48,399 --> 02:41:50,479
different automation rules and so on

4673
02:41:50,479 --> 02:41:52,560
and you can interact with the data

4674
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:54,640
however if you just want to know that

4675
02:41:54,640 --> 02:41:56,399
whenever you're tripping over something

4676
02:41:56,399 --> 02:41:58,160
that's contained in a data set

4677
02:41:58,160 --> 02:42:01,600
in that case caching is enough

4678
02:42:07,359 --> 02:42:09,680
how much can alert if the database phd

4679
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:11,600
modules are insecure outdated

4680
02:42:11,600 --> 02:42:15,439
yes so

4681
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:17,520
we we weren't going to talk about that

4682
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:18,640
but we can we can show that

4683
02:42:18,640 --> 02:42:21,279
so it's two separate things so one uh

4684
02:42:21,279 --> 02:42:23,520
for the interconnected misfit instances

4685
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:24,720
you can see the version that they're

4686
02:42:24,720 --> 02:42:26,399
running so you can check if they're

4687
02:42:26,399 --> 02:42:28,080
running an old miss then you can disable

4688
02:42:28,080 --> 02:42:29,439
the connection this is only for misp

4689
02:42:29,439 --> 02:42:30,640
itself now for the

4690
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:33,279
individual modules and so on we have a

4691
02:42:33,279 --> 02:42:35,200
security audit invest that you can run

4692
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:36,240
your instance

4693
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:38,080
so this is you cannot check this for

4694
02:42:38,080 --> 02:42:40,399
your uh your partners of course but for

4695
02:42:40,399 --> 02:42:41,680
your own misfortune

4696
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:43,279
so you have the diagnostic tool if you

4697
02:42:43,279 --> 02:42:45,680
go there you have further down a list of

4698
02:42:45,680 --> 02:42:46,240
different

4699
02:42:46,240 --> 02:42:49,359
uh security audits uh that tells you

4700
02:42:49,359 --> 02:42:51,439
about all the things that are currently

4701
02:42:51,439 --> 02:42:53,120
misconfigured on your instance outdate

4702
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:54,720
on your instance and so on

4703
02:42:54,720 --> 02:42:56,479
uh further down you will also see the

4704
02:42:56,479 --> 02:42:58,479
different versions of the packages that

4705
02:42:58,479 --> 02:42:59,840
are being used whether they're

4706
02:42:59,840 --> 02:43:01,680
up to date whether they're out or

4707
02:43:01,680 --> 02:43:03,120
outdated and so on

4708
02:43:03,120 --> 02:43:05,359
so just as an administrator have a look

4709
02:43:05,359 --> 02:43:07,279
at the diagnostic every now and then so

4710
02:43:07,279 --> 02:43:09,120
to see if something is updated needs to

4711
02:43:09,120 --> 02:43:11,680
be fixed

4712
02:43:12,319 --> 02:43:15,920
okay um so

4713
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:17,439
there's another question where can i

4714
02:43:17,439 --> 02:43:19,279
enable fetching of a feed i can only see

4715
02:43:19,279 --> 02:43:20,479
enable and caching

4716
02:43:20,479 --> 02:43:23,840
yeah the the naming is not great enable

4717
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:24,960
is fetching and

4718
02:43:24,960 --> 02:43:27,600
caching enable this caching so we just

4719
02:43:27,600 --> 02:43:28,319
enable it

4720
02:43:28,319 --> 02:43:31,600
it's really fetching uh we should we

4721
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:33,279
should probably change the label of that

4722
02:43:33,279 --> 02:43:35,040
button because that's a little bit messy

4723
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:37,760
so so basically those ones are two

4724
02:43:37,760 --> 02:43:39,200
enable functions

4725
02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:42,960
so uh yeah indeed so you can disable

4726
02:43:42,960 --> 02:43:45,040
enabled but it's still enabled only for

4727
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:47,279
the caching

4728
02:43:47,279 --> 02:43:49,760
yeah so enabled really is fetching

4729
02:43:49,760 --> 02:43:50,560
enabled

4730
02:43:50,560 --> 02:43:54,080
uh yeah maybe we should

4731
02:43:54,080 --> 02:43:56,800
change it yeah we should show you here

4732
02:43:56,800 --> 02:43:59,840
yeah like thank you yeah

4733
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:08,080
okay for splunk forwarder on miss what

4734
02:44:08,080 --> 02:44:09,279
you can do for example

4735
02:44:09,279 --> 02:44:13,680
is to have the setup of the zero mq feet

4736
02:44:13,680 --> 02:44:15,920
so that means you have a complete stream

4737
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:16,800
of the data

4738
02:44:16,800 --> 02:44:19,439
and then you have a stick that is

4739
02:44:19,439 --> 02:44:20,160
running uh

4740
02:44:20,160 --> 02:44:22,800
running for force blank and doing the

4741
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:23,520
the query

4742
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:26,000
another option is to use um because

4743
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:27,439
there was some discussion about it

4744
02:44:27,439 --> 02:44:29,100
i could mention it

4745
02:44:29,100 --> 02:44:30,800
[Music]

4746
02:44:30,800 --> 02:44:33,920
so there is a plugin

4747
02:44:33,920 --> 02:44:38,080
and this one um which is part of the

4748
02:44:38,080 --> 02:44:40,720
application too which is a mis-42 splunk

4749
02:44:40,720 --> 02:44:42,399
which is a connector for

4750
02:44:42,399 --> 02:44:45,520
for mispence blank but this one is using

4751
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:47,279
the api

4752
02:44:47,279 --> 02:44:49,120
uh but if you want to use the omq you

4753
02:44:49,120 --> 02:44:51,359
can still use your mq directly and

4754
02:44:51,359 --> 02:44:54,000
have a stream of data so you have your

4755
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:55,760
mq or kafka

4756
02:44:55,760 --> 02:44:57,600
but then you need to do a script to

4757
02:44:57,600 --> 02:45:01,439
access your strength

4758
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:14,720
okay perhaps

4759
02:45:14,720 --> 02:45:16,080
unless there are more questions on this

4760
02:45:16,080 --> 02:45:18,399
part uh we can also move to

4761
02:45:18,399 --> 02:45:19,840
the sharing groups but if you have more

4762
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:21,680
questions just uh shoot

4763
02:45:21,680 --> 02:45:24,720
yeah actually the question yeah

4764
02:45:25,359 --> 02:45:28,960
no no it's it's good because if we just

4765
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:30,720
blindly talk about topics that might not

4766
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:32,160
be interesting it's much better to just

4767
02:45:32,160 --> 02:45:33,120
go into

4768
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:35,279
topics that you you folks are interested

4769
02:45:35,279 --> 02:45:37,439
in

4770
02:45:37,840 --> 02:45:39,359
but in the meanwhile let's talk a little

4771
02:45:39,359 --> 02:45:42,160
bit about the sharing groups um because

4772
02:45:42,160 --> 02:45:43,680
it's linked to a question that someone

4773
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:44,319
asked about

4774
02:45:44,319 --> 02:45:47,760
is it is it possible um to have

4775
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:49,760
multiple sharing communities on a single

4776
02:45:49,760 --> 02:45:50,800
instance yes

4777
02:45:50,800 --> 02:45:52,399
and sharing roof is one of the ways to

4778
02:45:52,399 --> 02:45:54,000
do it

4779
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,240
the security audit was in the

4780
02:45:56,240 --> 02:45:59,039
administration

4781
02:46:00,240 --> 02:46:04,000
okay perfect okay

4782
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:05,920
um then i'm going to the list sharing

4783
02:46:05,920 --> 02:46:07,120
groups

4784
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:09,439
so maybe so if you want to play with the

4785
02:46:09,439 --> 02:46:11,359
sharing groups you have global actions

4786
02:46:11,359 --> 02:46:13,040
uh lead sharing groups so i've shared

4787
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:15,359
english

4788
02:46:15,760 --> 02:46:18,319
for the one that are testing the uh with

4789
02:46:18,319 --> 02:46:20,160
the training

4790
02:46:20,160 --> 02:46:21,359
and there's another question we can go

4791
02:46:21,359 --> 02:46:22,720
into that a little bit afterwards but

4792
02:46:22,720 --> 02:46:24,479
that's uh yeah we can do the

4793
02:46:24,479 --> 02:46:27,359
same yeah yeah so let's let's do sharing

4794
02:46:27,359 --> 02:46:28,399
groups first quickly

4795
02:46:28,399 --> 02:46:30,319
and then we talk about the the decaying

4796
02:46:30,319 --> 02:46:32,479
and the sightings

4797
02:46:32,479 --> 02:46:33,920
okay so very quickly about the sharing

4798
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:35,760
group so we talked a little bit about

4799
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:37,279
distribution levels the other day where

4800
02:46:37,279 --> 02:46:38,800
you can set your organization only

4801
02:46:38,800 --> 02:46:40,399
community only and so on that defines

4802
02:46:40,399 --> 02:46:41,840
how far the information is allowed to

4803
02:46:41,840 --> 02:46:42,640
travel

4804
02:46:42,640 --> 02:46:44,080
now there is an alternate model that

4805
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:45,600
we're using whenever we want to have a

4806
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:46,960
distribution list

4807
02:46:46,960 --> 02:46:48,720
so whenever we want to say instead of

4808
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:50,240
deciding how far the information is

4809
02:46:50,240 --> 02:46:52,080
allowed to travel we want to set

4810
02:46:52,080 --> 02:46:54,000
who exactly gets to receive the

4811
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:55,760
information

4812
02:46:55,760 --> 02:46:57,200
and for this we use the sharing rules

4813
02:46:57,200 --> 02:46:58,640
this is basically like a composite

4814
02:46:58,640 --> 02:46:59,279
system

4815
02:46:59,279 --> 02:47:01,439
that includes a list of organizations

4816
02:47:01,439 --> 02:47:02,319
specified by

4817
02:47:02,319 --> 02:47:04,640
uuid as well as servers where the data

4818
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:06,640
is a lot of travel

4819
02:47:06,640 --> 02:47:08,560
we have two main use cases for this one

4820
02:47:08,560 --> 02:47:09,920
of them is if you have an incident for

4821
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:10,640
example

4822
02:47:10,640 --> 02:47:12,240
and you want to collaborate with one or

4823
02:47:12,240 --> 02:47:14,240
two parties we created an ad hoc sharing

4824
02:47:14,240 --> 02:47:15,439
group

4825
02:47:15,439 --> 02:47:18,000
for that individual incident where we

4826
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:18,880
only involve

4827
02:47:18,880 --> 02:47:21,359
three four organizations and once we're

4828
02:47:21,359 --> 02:47:23,200
done we retire the sharing group

4829
02:47:23,200 --> 02:47:25,760
alternatively we have recurring sharing

4830
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:26,800
groups that are used by

4831
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:28,560
by sub-communities within the community

4832
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:30,080
so there was a question before

4833
02:47:30,080 --> 02:47:31,520
how can you handle more than one

4834
02:47:31,520 --> 02:47:34,000
community uh on the single miss pencils

4835
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:35,840
this is the main way of doing it

4836
02:47:35,840 --> 02:47:38,000
so for example if we have a broad

4837
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:39,040
sharing community

4838
02:47:39,040 --> 02:47:41,120
for example our private sector sharing

4839
02:47:41,120 --> 02:47:43,359
community we create a sharing group for

4840
02:47:43,359 --> 02:47:45,200
the financial sector or the financial

4841
02:47:45,200 --> 02:47:47,279
sector of luxembourg specifically with

4842
02:47:47,279 --> 02:47:48,160
uh

4843
02:47:48,160 --> 02:47:50,319
on the instance and then any event that

4844
02:47:50,319 --> 02:47:52,319
is meant to be shared or any data point

4845
02:47:52,319 --> 02:47:54,080
is meant to be shared only with those

4846
02:47:54,080 --> 02:47:56,640
recipients will have that sharing group

4847
02:47:56,640 --> 02:47:57,040
as

4848
02:47:57,040 --> 02:47:59,840
a recipient so let's have a look at how

4849
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:02,000
to create such a sharing group quickly

4850
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,160
so keep in mind this is one of the

4851
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:05,920
things where things can go wrong because

4852
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:07,840
you really want to address a certain set

4853
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:09,600
of organizations so your intent is

4854
02:48:09,600 --> 02:48:10,960
already to limit

4855
02:48:10,960 --> 02:48:14,720
the sharing so we wanted to have a tool

4856
02:48:14,720 --> 02:48:16,000
that walks you through in step

4857
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:17,760
by step and trying to send the check

4858
02:48:17,760 --> 02:48:19,359
what you do and give you feedback on

4859
02:48:19,359 --> 02:48:20,880
what the outcome of it will be so that

4860
02:48:20,880 --> 02:48:22,800
we can avoid issues with it

4861
02:48:22,800 --> 02:48:25,040
the first page is basically the metadata

4862
02:48:25,040 --> 02:48:26,720
page where we describe the sharing group

4863
02:48:26,720 --> 02:48:28,640
in a human readable format

4864
02:48:28,640 --> 02:48:30,800
now this is especially important because

4865
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:32,479
mr has the functionality

4866
02:48:32,479 --> 02:48:36,000
to involve other parties in extending

4867
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:37,920
the sharing group imagine a situation if

4868
02:48:37,920 --> 02:48:39,920
i were to share with all law enforcement

4869
02:48:39,920 --> 02:48:41,439
agencies in europe

4870
02:48:41,439 --> 02:48:43,279
i probably would have no idea who the

4871
02:48:43,279 --> 02:48:45,840
law enforcement agencies in say denmark

4872
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:46,399
are

4873
02:48:46,399 --> 02:48:48,479
but i might have a trusted partner for

4874
02:48:48,479 --> 02:48:50,319
example national sea cert in denmark

4875
02:48:50,319 --> 02:48:51,040
that can

4876
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:53,279
involve in the exchange so they can

4877
02:48:53,279 --> 02:48:55,279
appoint the right organizations and

4878
02:48:55,279 --> 02:48:57,359
include those in the sharing group so

4879
02:48:57,359 --> 02:48:58,399
this is where this

4880
02:48:58,399 --> 02:49:00,240
entire extension mechanism comes in this

4881
02:49:00,240 --> 02:49:02,399
is purely optional if you want to be

4882
02:49:02,399 --> 02:49:04,399
in sole control of who gets to see the

4883
02:49:04,399 --> 02:49:06,399
data then you don't need to get

4884
02:49:06,399 --> 02:49:08,399
keep extension rights to anyone else but

4885
02:49:08,399 --> 02:49:09,840
if you want to do it this becomes

4886
02:49:09,840 --> 02:49:11,920
especially important

4887
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:13,600
explaining to the members of the sharing

4888
02:49:13,600 --> 02:49:14,880
group who they're meant to share the

4889
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:16,160
information with

4890
02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:18,080
so here we have an example first.org

4891
02:49:18,080 --> 02:49:19,600
members as a sharing group

4892
02:49:19,600 --> 02:49:21,840
and registers organizations at first

4893
02:49:21,840 --> 02:49:24,080
start is pretty understandable

4894
02:49:24,080 --> 02:49:25,840
once we're done we can start adding the

4895
02:49:25,840 --> 02:49:27,359
individual organizations there's a

4896
02:49:27,359 --> 02:49:28,560
question uh doing to create a new

4897
02:49:28,560 --> 02:49:30,479
organization in miss vincent's

4898
02:49:30,479 --> 02:49:32,240
is best practice before starting a new

4899
02:49:32,240 --> 02:49:33,920
shane group uh

4900
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:35,439
yeah generally you should have your own

4901
02:49:35,439 --> 02:49:37,040
organization created

4902
02:49:37,040 --> 02:49:39,040
and make sure that you're consistent

4903
02:49:39,040 --> 02:49:40,800
with the usage of the uid of the

4904
02:49:40,800 --> 02:49:41,840
organization

4905
02:49:41,840 --> 02:49:43,760
so if you have if you already have

4906
02:49:43,760 --> 02:49:45,680
access to to another miss for instance

4907
02:49:45,680 --> 02:49:47,920
and you're using um

4908
02:49:47,920 --> 02:49:50,720
that as a guest so to say so as a user

4909
02:49:50,720 --> 02:49:52,080
of a community

4910
02:49:52,080 --> 02:49:54,479
not not being the host once you set up

4911
02:49:54,479 --> 02:49:56,399
your own miss pinsons it's best to reuse

4912
02:49:56,399 --> 02:49:58,319
the uid of the organization that you use

4913
02:49:58,319 --> 02:49:59,840
on the other one so the data that you

4914
02:49:59,840 --> 02:50:01,279
create on the other instance links up

4915
02:50:01,279 --> 02:50:03,920
with your organization

4916
02:50:03,920 --> 02:50:06,479
okay now going back to this by default

4917
02:50:06,479 --> 02:50:08,080
whenever we create a sharing group

4918
02:50:08,080 --> 02:50:11,200
our own organization is always included

4919
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:14,319
so so this is something that we

4920
02:50:14,319 --> 02:50:16,640
where we do not allow creating sharing

4921
02:50:16,640 --> 02:50:18,080
groups on behalf of others

4922
02:50:18,080 --> 02:50:19,840
so you always have to be included that's

4923
02:50:19,840 --> 02:50:21,359
one of the caveats here

4924
02:50:21,359 --> 02:50:23,200
then we have two pools of organizations

4925
02:50:23,200 --> 02:50:24,880
to pick from this is a little bit

4926
02:50:24,880 --> 02:50:26,000
confusing and

4927
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
we're not in the administration part of

4928
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:29,680
this so we skipped over this entire

4929
02:50:29,680 --> 02:50:31,359
thing about organizations but just as a

4930
02:50:31,359 --> 02:50:32,080
quick

4931
02:50:32,080 --> 02:50:35,279
explanation any any user any

4932
02:50:35,279 --> 02:50:36,800
organization that is meant to have

4933
02:50:36,800 --> 02:50:38,319
access to your miss for instance will be

4934
02:50:38,319 --> 02:50:39,840
a local organization

4935
02:50:39,840 --> 02:50:41,520
and organizations that your instance

4936
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:43,520
knows about because data was transferred

4937
02:50:43,520 --> 02:50:45,359
that was created by that organization

4938
02:50:45,359 --> 02:50:47,040
from different misspen since goes into

4939
02:50:47,040 --> 02:50:49,439
the remote organization pool

4940
02:50:49,439 --> 02:50:50,960
so make sure you check both when you're

4941
02:50:50,960 --> 02:50:53,120
looking for organizations

4942
02:50:53,120 --> 02:50:54,640
and the organizations that you want to

4943
02:50:54,640 --> 02:50:56,640
involve in the exchange so here we've

4944
02:50:56,640 --> 02:50:57,520
had the few that

4945
02:50:57,520 --> 02:51:00,319
and that should be enough and then you

4946
02:51:00,319 --> 02:51:00,880
can

4947
02:51:00,880 --> 02:51:02,800
appoint certain organizations to extend

4948
02:51:02,800 --> 02:51:04,000
it so in this case we say

4949
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,160
okay we don't know who all the first

4950
02:51:06,160 --> 02:51:07,840
members are in this case for some reason

4951
02:51:07,840 --> 02:51:09,680
because we can't go to the website

4952
02:51:09,680 --> 02:51:11,760
i don't know why that would ever happen

4953
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:14,080
but we want to entrust

4954
02:51:14,080 --> 02:51:17,200
usa golf for example

4955
02:51:17,200 --> 02:51:19,840
to extend the sharing group uh based on

4956
02:51:19,840 --> 02:51:22,000
the spirit of what we intended

4957
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
uh with the sharing group so in this

4958
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:25,439
case we would have

4959
02:51:25,439 --> 02:51:28,479
uh four members of the sharing group

4960
02:51:28,479 --> 02:51:31,760
and two members with extension rights

4961
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:34,800
in addition moving on to the next page

4962
02:51:34,800 --> 02:51:36,720
we can start limiting it to which

4963
02:51:36,720 --> 02:51:38,479
service information is allowed to flow

4964
02:51:38,479 --> 02:51:39,120
to

4965
02:51:39,120 --> 02:51:40,720
now this is something that is generally

4966
02:51:40,720 --> 02:51:42,160
not that useful

4967
02:51:42,160 --> 02:51:45,439
because um because

4968
02:51:45,439 --> 02:51:47,840
even when we we wouldn't set which

4969
02:51:47,840 --> 02:51:49,920
servers the latest vlog to flow through

4970
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:51,600
the ownership of the server is still

4971
02:51:51,600 --> 02:51:53,600
inspected so it means that

4972
02:51:53,600 --> 02:51:55,120
in this case if we would set it into

4973
02:51:55,120 --> 02:51:57,040
roaming mode so ignore this error in the

4974
02:51:57,040 --> 02:51:58,479
server restrictions

4975
02:51:58,479 --> 02:52:01,359
what would happen is miss would deduce

4976
02:52:01,359 --> 02:52:02,960
who owns the remote instances

4977
02:52:02,960 --> 02:52:04,880
and unless the owner of the remote

4978
02:52:04,880 --> 02:52:06,399
instance is included in the list of

4979
02:52:06,399 --> 02:52:09,359
organizations on the previous tab

4980
02:52:09,359 --> 02:52:10,640
the data would not flow in that

4981
02:52:10,640 --> 02:52:12,880
direction anyway but if we want to

4982
02:52:12,880 --> 02:52:14,000
further restrict it

4983
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,880
for example if you were to share with

4984
02:52:16,880 --> 02:52:18,399
circle and you're connected to both the

4985
02:52:18,399 --> 02:52:19,920
private sector and the national sea

4986
02:52:19,920 --> 02:52:21,359
search community

4987
02:52:21,359 --> 02:52:22,800
and you only want to share with the

4988
02:52:22,800 --> 02:52:24,240
national search community and not the

4989
02:52:24,240 --> 02:52:25,520
private sector one

4990
02:52:25,520 --> 02:52:28,160
then you would not use roaming mode and

4991
02:52:28,160 --> 02:52:30,080
instead specify the individual servers

4992
02:52:30,080 --> 02:52:31,600
that you wanted to share with

4993
02:52:31,600 --> 02:52:33,520
so that's just up to you which model you

4994
02:52:33,520 --> 02:52:35,279
want to use generally roaming mode is

4995
02:52:35,279 --> 02:52:37,439
fine for most use cases

4996
02:52:37,439 --> 02:52:39,040
so set up the configuration that you

4997
02:52:39,040 --> 02:52:41,120
want here as well go to the next page

4998
02:52:41,120 --> 02:52:43,439
and then we get a recap of what will

4999
02:52:43,439 --> 02:52:44,800
happen with data

5000
02:52:44,800 --> 02:52:47,040
that get labeled with the sharing group

5001
02:52:47,040 --> 02:52:48,479
now

5002
02:52:48,479 --> 02:52:50,960
we are trained from ground up basically

5003
02:52:50,960 --> 02:52:51,680
to

5004
02:52:51,680 --> 02:52:55,359
ignore any warning texts and recaps like

5005
02:52:55,359 --> 02:52:56,720
that please don't do that

5006
02:52:56,720 --> 02:52:58,960
this is for your own good so that you

5007
02:52:58,960 --> 02:53:00,880
and don't accidentally overshare or

5008
02:53:00,880 --> 02:53:02,160
miss out on someone that should be

5009
02:53:02,160 --> 02:53:04,240
shared to just read through it and when

5010
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:06,160
you're happy with it click submit

5011
02:53:06,160 --> 02:53:07,520
and then you basically have your sharing

5012
02:53:07,520 --> 02:53:09,600
group created from this moment on we

5013
02:53:09,600 --> 02:53:11,040
have created our sharing group

5014
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:14,560
and if we were to now create a new event

5015
02:53:14,560 --> 02:53:16,720
or add an attribute to an event we could

5016
02:53:16,720 --> 02:53:18,560
use the sharing group as distribution

5017
02:53:18,560 --> 02:53:20,720
setting

5018
02:53:20,720 --> 02:53:23,680
okay now if a sharing group no longer

5019
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:25,279
has any use so just quickly if i

5020
02:53:25,279 --> 02:53:27,359
edit edit it and there it is sharing

5021
02:53:27,359 --> 02:53:29,439
group and there it's now in the list of

5022
02:53:29,439 --> 02:53:31,520
sharing groups that are available

5023
02:53:31,520 --> 02:53:34,479
we have two interesting

5024
02:53:35,040 --> 02:53:37,120
okay so it's as simple as that basically

5025
02:53:37,120 --> 02:53:38,319
you can do it on the attribute and

5026
02:53:38,319 --> 02:53:39,600
object level as well

5027
02:53:39,600 --> 02:53:41,200
if a sharing group has outlived its

5028
02:53:41,200 --> 02:53:43,120
purpose an incident is closed and it was

5029
02:53:43,120 --> 02:53:44,560
an ad hoc sharing group and you want to

5030
02:53:44,560 --> 02:53:46,240
get rid of it so that it's no longer

5031
02:53:46,240 --> 02:53:47,760
visible on the ui

5032
02:53:47,760 --> 02:53:49,680
and we generally never delete sharing

5033
02:53:49,680 --> 02:53:52,080
groups because this still

5034
02:53:52,080 --> 02:53:53,520
basically finds who gets to see the

5035
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:56,800
information but we retire them instead

5036
02:53:56,800 --> 02:53:58,720
and we make it non-selectable so the

5037
02:53:58,720 --> 02:54:00,240
sharing group still stays there as an

5038
02:54:00,240 --> 02:54:01,920
object but it will no longer clutter the

5039
02:54:01,920 --> 02:54:03,600
ui when you're selecting sharing groups

5040
02:54:03,600 --> 02:54:04,560
anymore

5041
02:54:04,560 --> 02:54:06,160
so this is the way how we retire them in

5042
02:54:06,160 --> 02:54:08,560
general

5043
02:54:10,080 --> 02:54:11,920
okay that's basically it for the sharing

5044
02:54:11,920 --> 02:54:15,600
groups uh any questions so far

5045
02:54:15,600 --> 02:54:17,120
or or if not then we can talk a little

5046
02:54:17,120 --> 02:54:18,640
bit about the decaying of indicators

5047
02:54:18,640 --> 02:54:20,080
inside things

5048
02:54:20,080 --> 02:54:22,540
alex you want to take that no yeah

5049
02:54:22,540 --> 02:54:25,589
[Music]

5050
02:54:28,560 --> 02:54:30,560
i don't know if some some good example

5051
02:54:30,560 --> 02:54:35,840
here but you can never look

5052
02:54:37,279 --> 02:54:38,960
okay so the first thing that is

5053
02:54:38,960 --> 02:54:41,120
important is we have um

5054
02:54:41,120 --> 02:54:43,680
models uh i think in this training

5055
02:54:43,680 --> 02:54:44,960
instance we have already

5056
02:54:44,960 --> 02:54:46,560
four different models you can create

5057
02:54:46,560 --> 02:54:48,960
your own miscomm bundle with a thing two

5058
02:54:48,960 --> 02:54:50,160
or three models

5059
02:54:50,160 --> 02:54:52,080
so if you want to add yours it's

5060
02:54:52,080 --> 02:54:53,680
straightforward

5061
02:54:53,680 --> 02:54:55,920
you can even have custom models models

5062
02:54:55,920 --> 02:54:58,240
that you share but i'll take a very

5063
02:54:58,240 --> 02:55:03,840
very simple one i look at the

5064
02:55:03,920 --> 02:55:05,760
fishing one so that that's basically the

5065
02:55:05,760 --> 02:55:07,200
one that uh

5066
02:55:07,200 --> 02:55:10,240
everyone can use and uh enabled

5067
02:55:10,240 --> 02:55:13,040
alexa sami also just shared it a good

5068
02:55:13,040 --> 02:55:14,880
example is event 15

5069
02:55:14,880 --> 02:55:19,438
19. okay okay great

5070
02:55:23,520 --> 02:55:26,399
so 15

5071
02:55:28,319 --> 02:55:33,120
15 which one 98

5072
02:55:33,120 --> 02:55:45,840
okay great

5073
02:55:47,760 --> 02:55:49,520
it it has some settings and relevant

5074
02:55:49,520 --> 02:55:51,200
texture yeah perfect

5075
02:55:51,200 --> 02:55:54,160
great okay good example okay so you see

5076
02:55:54,160 --> 02:55:55,840
that on this one we we have this tab

5077
02:55:55,840 --> 02:55:57,920
there on the current base view on the

5078
02:55:57,920 --> 02:55:58,960
dks car

5079
02:55:58,960 --> 02:56:01,680
so what is it it's as we said last time

5080
02:56:01,680 --> 02:56:03,200
of regarding decaying it's really an

5081
02:56:03,200 --> 02:56:04,000
overlay

5082
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:05,439
and you see you have a different model

5083
02:56:05,439 --> 02:56:09,120
here apply you see that some are in

5084
02:56:09,120 --> 02:56:11,520
red somewhere in green so it means that

5085
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:12,880
it's already decay

5086
02:56:12,880 --> 02:56:16,000
or not valid anymore for those acquiring

5087
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:17,279
this model for the phishing model

5088
02:56:17,279 --> 02:56:18,160
nevertheless

5089
02:56:18,160 --> 02:56:19,840
for the energy for the infrared

5090
02:56:19,840 --> 02:56:21,200
detection system model

5091
02:56:21,200 --> 02:56:24,399
this one is still applicable

5092
02:56:24,399 --> 02:56:26,160
so we can we can have a look at that one

5093
02:56:26,160 --> 02:56:27,520
for example

5094
02:56:27,520 --> 02:56:30,560
yes um so you see that this one has an

5095
02:56:30,560 --> 02:56:31,279
interesting

5096
02:56:31,279 --> 02:56:33,920
uh thing so you have a specific value

5097
02:56:33,920 --> 02:56:34,479
which is

5098
02:56:34,479 --> 02:56:37,760
strange but okay uh then we have um

5099
02:56:37,760 --> 02:56:40,160
you see that this is specific became and

5100
02:56:40,160 --> 02:56:42,240
as a specific moment in time

5101
02:56:42,240 --> 02:56:44,160
someone was doing a fighting which

5102
02:56:44,160 --> 02:56:45,840
basically resets

5103
02:56:45,840 --> 02:56:48,720
the current value so that means an

5104
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:50,880
example here a practical one

5105
02:56:50,880 --> 02:56:52,800
you receive an i don't know a nursing

5106
02:56:52,800 --> 02:56:54,319
sheet from i don't know an antivirus

5107
02:56:54,319 --> 02:56:55,439
vendor

5108
02:56:55,439 --> 02:56:57,680
uh you inject it into your intuition

5109
02:56:57,680 --> 02:56:59,200
detection systems and at some point in

5110
02:56:59,200 --> 02:56:59,920
time

5111
02:56:59,920 --> 02:57:02,720
um you you see it again so it means that

5112
02:57:02,720 --> 02:57:03,120
okay

5113
02:57:03,120 --> 02:57:05,520
you get you you you sit on your network

5114
02:57:05,520 --> 02:57:06,720
activity then

5115
02:57:06,720 --> 02:57:09,520
it resets the specific value and this

5116
02:57:09,520 --> 02:57:10,880
one is decaying again

5117
02:57:10,880 --> 02:57:13,680
until erasing a specific threshold cut

5118
02:57:13,680 --> 02:57:14,240
where

5119
02:57:14,240 --> 02:57:16,880
if it's going into this zone it means

5120
02:57:16,880 --> 02:57:18,479
that this one is

5121
02:57:18,479 --> 02:57:22,800
currently unset um you see that this one

5122
02:57:22,800 --> 02:57:23,279
is

5123
02:57:23,279 --> 02:57:26,479
for this specific specific value we see

5124
02:57:26,479 --> 02:57:26,880
that

5125
02:57:26,880 --> 02:57:29,359
this one depending on the tax set you

5126
02:57:29,359 --> 02:57:30,560
have a specific value that

5127
02:57:30,560 --> 02:57:33,200
are set so for example the the tagging

5128
02:57:33,200 --> 02:57:34,080
system in mist

5129
02:57:34,080 --> 02:57:36,560
has numerical value so for some it's not

5130
02:57:36,560 --> 02:57:37,920
set but for some

5131
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:40,640
set so for example for the certainty or

5132
02:57:40,640 --> 02:57:41,760
the sustainability

5133
02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:44,240
you have a specific value set if you see

5134
02:57:44,240 --> 02:57:45,600
for example within exactly no it's

5135
02:57:45,600 --> 02:57:46,399
between

5136
02:57:46,399 --> 02:57:48,640
0 and 100 you can go above but it's

5137
02:57:48,640 --> 02:57:51,359
usually the the

5138
02:57:51,359 --> 02:57:54,399
the area that is used for the numerical

5139
02:57:54,399 --> 02:57:56,479
values there and you see that for this

5140
02:57:56,479 --> 02:57:57,760
one is

5141
02:57:57,760 --> 02:58:01,120
set again this specific value

5142
02:58:01,120 --> 02:58:03,760
there for the score is accessible

5143
02:58:03,760 --> 02:58:04,640
through the api

5144
02:58:04,640 --> 02:58:07,760
and then you can decide on your script

5145
02:58:07,760 --> 02:58:09,359
okay i use this value or not

5146
02:58:09,359 --> 02:58:11,760
so it doesn't change at all anything on

5147
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:13,359
the value itself

5148
02:58:13,359 --> 02:58:16,560
the ids flag and so on but it's just uh

5149
02:58:16,560 --> 02:58:20,319
showing a different score

5150
02:58:20,319 --> 02:58:21,920
i will not go to all the details but

5151
02:58:21,920 --> 02:58:23,760
let's release a quick quick introduction

5152
02:58:23,760 --> 02:58:24,560
on the uh

5153
02:58:24,560 --> 02:58:27,760
on the uh okay i don't know if you want

5154
02:58:27,760 --> 02:58:28,800
to add something

5155
02:58:28,800 --> 02:58:30,640
no i mean i mean the important thing

5156
02:58:30,640 --> 02:58:32,479
with the decaying is what alex mentioned

5157
02:58:32,479 --> 02:58:33,200
this is indeed

5158
02:58:33,200 --> 02:58:34,560
something that not that is not

5159
02:58:34,560 --> 02:58:37,359
persistent that is changed on query

5160
02:58:37,359 --> 02:58:38,800
and the idea is really that when you're

5161
02:58:38,800 --> 02:58:40,399
doing the api queries

5162
02:58:40,399 --> 02:58:42,640
if you have these models defined and

5163
02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:43,840
that you can

5164
02:58:43,840 --> 02:58:47,120
then set the thresholds and really

5165
02:58:47,120 --> 02:58:48,560
depending on the use case of different

5166
02:58:48,560 --> 02:58:51,200
tools that you're feeding have different

5167
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:53,279
outcomes of the queries depending on

5168
02:58:53,279 --> 02:58:54,880
which model use

5169
02:58:54,880 --> 02:58:56,880
and that's why we really i would say

5170
02:58:56,880 --> 02:58:58,720
push people and organizations to use the

5171
02:58:58,720 --> 02:58:59,680
sightings because

5172
02:58:59,680 --> 02:59:02,000
the sighting is really helping the uh

5173
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:03,359
decaying

5174
02:59:03,359 --> 02:59:05,520
so um one of the things that we have

5175
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:06,880
seen for example people are doing

5176
02:59:06,880 --> 02:59:08,240
slightly not only from

5177
02:59:08,240 --> 02:59:11,040
androgen electron system but from sim so

5178
02:59:11,040 --> 02:59:12,160
if you have a cm

5179
02:59:12,160 --> 02:59:14,720
with the um i don't know if you see a

5180
02:59:14,720 --> 02:59:16,240
specific value

5181
02:59:16,240 --> 02:59:19,439
then you if it's provided back into mist

5182
02:59:19,439 --> 02:59:21,279
then you reset the value and so on so

5183
02:59:21,279 --> 02:59:22,560
that means you still need to do

5184
02:59:22,560 --> 02:59:24,640
investigation and search on it

5185
02:59:24,640 --> 02:59:27,040
and that that's really a nice way of

5186
02:59:27,040 --> 02:59:29,200
interacting with a cm for example

5187
02:59:29,200 --> 02:59:30,880
an intrusion detection system that needs

5188
02:59:30,880 --> 02:59:32,479
to be renewed on the rules

5189
02:59:32,479 --> 02:59:34,160
because if you're seeing the same maybe

5190
02:59:34,160 --> 02:59:35,920
we still need to continue to

5191
02:59:35,920 --> 02:59:38,000
investigate it on the network level for

5192
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,399
example

5193
02:59:40,840 --> 02:59:42,880
yeah maybe something else that is also

5194
02:59:42,880 --> 02:59:44,160
interesting here is

5195
02:59:44,160 --> 02:59:46,880
uh to talk a little bit about uh what we

5196
02:59:46,880 --> 02:59:49,040
currently use in terms of components for

5197
02:59:49,040 --> 02:59:49,600
this

5198
02:59:49,600 --> 02:59:51,120
and what we want to do in the future

5199
02:59:51,120 --> 02:59:52,640
with this so this is still an ongoing

5200
02:59:52,640 --> 02:59:53,920
effort

5201
02:59:53,920 --> 02:59:57,040
right now we're taking contacts tags uh

5202
02:59:57,040 --> 02:59:58,800
galaxies and so on into account we're

5203
02:59:58,800 --> 03:00:00,640
taking sightings into account

5204
03:00:00,640 --> 03:00:02,160
we're taking the type of the attribute

5205
03:00:02,160 --> 03:00:04,240
into account so ip addresses for example

5206
03:00:04,240 --> 03:00:06,319
will decay at different rates then

5207
03:00:06,319 --> 03:00:08,479
eyelashes for example but something we

5208
03:00:08,479 --> 03:00:09,680
want to make in the future

5209
03:00:09,680 --> 03:00:12,080
is to open this up to a hooking system

5210
03:00:12,080 --> 03:00:13,120
where you can also

5211
03:00:13,120 --> 03:00:15,279
include for example reputation systems

5212
03:00:15,279 --> 03:00:17,359
as well as an additional pillar

5213
03:00:17,359 --> 03:00:19,359
so if you have internal tools that run

5214
03:00:19,359 --> 03:00:21,120
reputation metrics and so on

5215
03:00:21,120 --> 03:00:22,399
to include that in your pipeline

5216
03:00:22,399 --> 03:00:26,319
directly but with the score calculation

5217
03:00:26,479 --> 03:00:29,439
when you're generating the data yeah i

5218
03:00:29,439 --> 03:00:31,200
saw an interesting case and it was

5219
03:00:31,200 --> 03:00:34,240
done by some custom organizations

5220
03:00:34,240 --> 03:00:36,399
border controls what they did is the

5221
03:00:36,399 --> 03:00:38,640
expiration on cash plate

5222
03:00:38,640 --> 03:00:40,160
so in some countries you have an

5223
03:00:40,160 --> 03:00:41,520
expiration on cash plate based on the

5224
03:00:41,520 --> 03:00:42,080
date

5225
03:00:42,080 --> 03:00:43,680
so they know that this carpet is not

5226
03:00:43,680 --> 03:00:46,319
anymore active or visible so they use

5227
03:00:46,319 --> 03:00:47,279
society

5228
03:00:47,279 --> 03:00:49,040
but if someone sees the car plate being

5229
03:00:49,040 --> 03:00:50,960
reused then they do the site thing again

5230
03:00:50,960 --> 03:00:52,160
so like that you can

5231
03:00:52,160 --> 03:00:53,920
really um play with it so it's working

5232
03:00:53,920 --> 03:00:55,680
with any value so it's working with

5233
03:00:55,680 --> 03:00:57,040
credit card numbers too

5234
03:00:57,040 --> 03:00:59,040
so if you have a keycard number with a

5235
03:00:59,040 --> 03:01:01,040
validity you can use this validity but

5236
03:01:01,040 --> 03:01:01,760
if it's

5237
03:01:01,760 --> 03:01:03,680
appearing somewhere being used and

5238
03:01:03,680 --> 03:01:05,359
blocked for example then you can do a

5239
03:01:05,359 --> 03:01:06,479
slightly so it

5240
03:01:06,479 --> 03:01:08,640
is not only a ip address and stuff like

5241
03:01:08,640 --> 03:01:12,000
that really any indicators

5242
03:01:12,640 --> 03:01:15,840
so it's always at attribute level as far

5243
03:01:15,840 --> 03:01:17,920
as i know we don't support object level

5244
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:19,760
right now but that's something that we

5245
03:01:19,760 --> 03:01:21,120
might at some point need

5246
03:01:21,120 --> 03:01:23,600
to detail the complete object but that's

5247
03:01:23,600 --> 03:01:25,279
for future

5248
03:01:25,279 --> 03:01:26,960
development i hope that we answer the

5249
03:01:26,960 --> 03:01:28,960
questions from

5250
03:01:28,960 --> 03:01:31,760
from the participants yeah and there's

5251
03:01:31,760 --> 03:01:33,680
we only have a few models defined so far

5252
03:01:33,680 --> 03:01:35,279
and you're really looking for more input

5253
03:01:35,279 --> 03:01:36,720
on there so if you have an experience

5254
03:01:36,720 --> 03:01:38,000
with this and you have your own use

5255
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:39,200
cases

5256
03:01:39,200 --> 03:01:40,800
and you build your own models please

5257
03:01:40,800 --> 03:01:43,279
also share it back to us because

5258
03:01:43,279 --> 03:01:44,800
that is one of the outcomes that we're

5259
03:01:44,800 --> 03:01:46,640
hoping for that we get more sane models

5260
03:01:46,640 --> 03:01:49,840
from the community out there

5261
03:01:50,399 --> 03:01:53,600
okay maybe now we can go a bit more into

5262
03:01:53,600 --> 03:01:55,840
customizing mist through those json

5263
03:01:55,840 --> 03:01:57,200
files

5264
03:01:57,200 --> 03:01:59,760
so we have in this various sorts of

5265
03:01:59,760 --> 03:02:00,800
information

5266
03:02:00,800 --> 03:02:04,640
or libraries i i'll take some

5267
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:07,600
i will go for the taxonomy and then we

5268
03:02:07,600 --> 03:02:08,399
can i can

5269
03:02:08,399 --> 03:02:11,680
show an example there so you see the df

5270
03:02:11,680 --> 03:02:12,479
by default

5271
03:02:12,479 --> 03:02:15,840
this library we have a taxonomies

5272
03:02:15,840 --> 03:02:17,040
library

5273
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:20,800
which is composed of uh more than 150

5274
03:02:20,800 --> 03:02:22,319
different taxonomies from different

5275
03:02:22,319 --> 03:02:25,840
project organizations and and

5276
03:02:25,840 --> 03:02:28,880
and workflow and so on and

5277
03:02:28,880 --> 03:02:31,600
then you can decide which one you enable

5278
03:02:31,600 --> 03:02:33,279
in your system

5279
03:02:33,279 --> 03:02:35,680
so if i take an example here for uh i

5280
03:02:35,680 --> 03:02:38,399
don't know i'll take the ransomware one

5281
03:02:38,399 --> 03:02:41,760
i will uh enable all of those um so that

5282
03:02:41,760 --> 03:02:42,319
means no

5283
03:02:42,319 --> 03:02:45,680
i have those taxonomies there it's a

5284
03:02:45,680 --> 03:02:47,680
taxonomy describing the kind of

5285
03:02:47,680 --> 03:02:49,040
ransomware that

5286
03:02:49,040 --> 03:02:53,359
that we we have including for example

5287
03:02:53,359 --> 03:02:56,479
the complexity level things like

5288
03:02:56,479 --> 03:02:58,399
this method of infections original

5289
03:02:58,399 --> 03:02:59,840
infections uh

5290
03:02:59,840 --> 03:03:02,080
malicious actions the purpose of it

5291
03:03:02,080 --> 03:03:03,840
because sometimes ransomware can be

5292
03:03:03,840 --> 03:03:07,279
for use for deployed as cover-up and and

5293
03:03:07,279 --> 03:03:10,720
different reasons and and this is not

5294
03:03:10,720 --> 03:03:11,359
coming from

5295
03:03:11,359 --> 03:03:13,680
from nowhere um it's coming from a

5296
03:03:13,680 --> 03:03:15,359
repository and i will i will directly

5297
03:03:15,359 --> 03:03:17,279
show you so i guess you can see how to

5298
03:03:17,279 --> 03:03:20,880
contribute there um

5299
03:03:21,920 --> 03:03:26,080
training much for the text number one

5300
03:03:26,080 --> 03:03:27,840
it's it's this repository of the

5301
03:03:27,840 --> 03:03:29,200
submodule into the

5302
03:03:29,200 --> 03:03:32,960
core system uh if i'm going to the

5303
03:03:32,960 --> 03:03:36,000
run somewhere one

5304
03:03:36,479 --> 03:03:40,240
just zoom a bit what do we have is

5305
03:03:40,240 --> 03:03:42,160
basically a directory

5306
03:03:42,160 --> 03:03:43,760
which is a namespace what you call the

5307
03:03:43,760 --> 03:03:45,279
taxonomies and then we have a different

5308
03:03:45,279 --> 03:03:46,800
file

5309
03:03:46,800 --> 03:03:48,640
if you can create this kind of decent

5310
03:03:48,640 --> 03:03:50,160
file you can create your own taxonomy

5311
03:03:50,160 --> 03:03:51,760
and what is the format

5312
03:03:51,760 --> 03:03:53,680
so today we will not go into details

5313
03:03:53,680 --> 03:03:54,960
about the different

5314
03:03:54,960 --> 03:03:56,640
model of the taxonomies and so on and

5315
03:03:56,640 --> 03:03:58,479
how you can do it but it's it's

5316
03:03:58,479 --> 03:04:00,160
you see it's really straightforward you

5317
03:04:00,160 --> 03:04:01,920
have a generic namespace

5318
03:04:01,920 --> 03:04:05,200
describing the the namespace uh

5319
03:04:05,200 --> 03:04:07,520
which virtuality some reference and then

5320
03:04:07,520 --> 03:04:09,120
you have the predicate so the predicate

5321
03:04:09,120 --> 03:04:10,479
is basically the second value

5322
03:04:10,479 --> 03:04:12,319
that you see on attack you have the

5323
03:04:12,319 --> 03:04:14,000
ransomware then you will get a

5324
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:16,720
predicate type and for each of the

5325
03:04:16,720 --> 03:04:17,760
predicate

5326
03:04:17,760 --> 03:04:20,000
you have a different kind of ransomware

5327
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:21,600
so you have scareware locker run

5328
03:04:21,600 --> 03:04:23,200
somewhere crypto and somewhere

5329
03:04:23,200 --> 03:04:25,200
the different kind of of ransomware that

5330
03:04:25,200 --> 03:04:26,960
you might have um

5331
03:04:26,960 --> 03:04:29,279
and that's that's basically it so if you

5332
03:04:29,279 --> 03:04:31,120
can modify those json files

5333
03:04:31,120 --> 03:04:34,240
you can modify or miss this behaving

5334
03:04:34,240 --> 03:04:36,240
on the taxonomy side and creating your

5335
03:04:36,240 --> 03:04:38,160
own if you don't want to share it back

5336
03:04:38,160 --> 03:04:39,200
it's fine too

5337
03:04:39,200 --> 03:04:41,600
in mist you can just drop the json files

5338
03:04:41,600 --> 03:04:43,760
update the taxonomy and then it appears

5339
03:04:43,760 --> 03:04:45,600
into your system so if you really want

5340
03:04:45,600 --> 03:04:47,200
to extend mist

5341
03:04:47,200 --> 03:04:50,479
on taxonomy level you can do it

5342
03:04:50,479 --> 03:04:53,760
and it's exactly the same model for

5343
03:04:53,760 --> 03:04:55,359
the galaxies so if i'm going to the

5344
03:04:55,359 --> 03:04:58,080
galaxy so galaxies are a

5345
03:04:58,080 --> 03:05:00,000
structure of information that looks like

5346
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,240
packs but are much more advanced because

5347
03:05:02,240 --> 03:05:04,000
you can structure a lot of of

5348
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
of more information i'm going back again

5349
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:07,439
to run somewhere so i guess you can

5350
03:05:07,439 --> 03:05:09,680
see a comparison why we we have run

5351
03:05:09,680 --> 03:05:11,359
somewhere on backside

5352
03:05:11,359 --> 03:05:12,880
which is more like a classification of

5353
03:05:12,880 --> 03:05:17,278
the type but we have a complete

5354
03:05:17,439 --> 03:05:19,760
database of all the different ransomware

5355
03:05:19,760 --> 03:05:20,560
so if i

5356
03:05:20,560 --> 03:05:25,600
take you i don't know if it is there uh

5357
03:05:25,600 --> 03:05:28,319
babucon somewhere that's a good example

5358
03:05:28,319 --> 03:05:30,479
so what do i have here it's uh

5359
03:05:30,479 --> 03:05:33,120
the description of the ransomware i have

5360
03:05:33,120 --> 03:05:34,800
some detail about the

5361
03:05:34,800 --> 03:05:36,800
specific value there and then the

5362
03:05:36,800 --> 03:05:38,160
reference of

5363
03:05:38,160 --> 03:05:41,279
uh of the ransomware uh i can

5364
03:05:41,279 --> 03:05:44,000
take another one uh exactly the thing

5365
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:45,760
with a different one we have some

5366
03:05:45,760 --> 03:05:47,200
synonyms there

5367
03:05:47,200 --> 03:05:50,319
so i type reveal and sodium key

5368
03:05:50,319 --> 03:05:53,520
b just appear so which

5369
03:05:53,520 --> 03:05:56,800
allow us to to have like multiple name

5370
03:05:56,800 --> 03:05:58,800
for single entity

5371
03:05:58,800 --> 03:06:01,520
same for trade actor i think maybe

5372
03:06:01,520 --> 03:06:03,279
trajectory because this one is a

5373
03:06:03,279 --> 03:06:15,840
good example

5374
03:06:17,600 --> 03:06:20,479
so we have the tractor galaxies um i

5375
03:06:20,479 --> 03:06:21,840
don't know i'm looking for

5376
03:06:21,840 --> 03:06:24,880
apt-29 for example

5377
03:06:24,880 --> 03:06:28,319
this one i have the complete galaxy

5378
03:06:28,319 --> 03:06:29,439
descriptions

5379
03:06:29,439 --> 03:06:31,920
and then all the different parameters

5380
03:06:31,920 --> 03:06:33,439
for this one is quite extensive because

5381
03:06:33,439 --> 03:06:35,040
we have a lot of things like

5382
03:06:35,040 --> 03:06:37,600
with the specs adapter uh target

5383
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:39,040
categories uh

5384
03:06:39,040 --> 03:06:41,279
we have some details of all the synonyms

5385
03:06:41,279 --> 03:06:42,640
so if you search

5386
03:06:42,640 --> 03:06:45,279
on miss for a cozy bear you will end up

5387
03:06:45,279 --> 03:06:45,680
on that

5388
03:06:45,680 --> 03:06:49,439
specific taxonomy there

5389
03:06:49,439 --> 03:06:52,240
um same with difference in industrial

5390
03:06:52,240 --> 03:06:54,000
for this one

5391
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:55,520
and that's the same exactly the same

5392
03:06:55,520 --> 03:06:58,000
model so if you want to extend mix

5393
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:01,120
at a later stage you can just look at

5394
03:07:01,120 --> 03:07:02,960
the galaxy we have what we call

5395
03:07:02,960 --> 03:07:06,319
cluster so it's in two steps you have

5396
03:07:06,319 --> 03:07:07,760
the galaxy on top and then you have the

5397
03:07:07,760 --> 03:07:09,359
cluster for all the elements

5398
03:07:09,359 --> 03:07:12,880
i'll go for the tractor one

5399
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:17,279
and it's again if you want to

5400
03:07:17,279 --> 03:07:22,399
extend it you can either go to the

5401
03:07:22,720 --> 03:07:25,760
json files create templates nevertheless

5402
03:07:25,760 --> 03:07:28,319
what you can do directly on on on myth

5403
03:07:28,319 --> 03:07:29,359
is to

5404
03:07:29,359 --> 03:07:32,240
do the forking so you can fork your

5405
03:07:32,240 --> 03:07:34,399
specific character

5406
03:07:34,399 --> 03:07:37,439
in misp and

5407
03:07:37,439 --> 03:07:39,920
do what you want to do on this one so

5408
03:07:39,920 --> 03:07:40,960
let me create

5409
03:07:40,960 --> 03:07:44,160
some metadata um add some specific

5410
03:07:44,160 --> 03:07:46,880
values there and so on

5411
03:07:46,880 --> 03:07:49,040
um that's that's the thing that is quite

5412
03:07:49,040 --> 03:07:50,240
quite interesting

5413
03:07:50,240 --> 03:07:52,399
and then you can start to edit the

5414
03:07:52,399 --> 03:07:54,720
cluster add some specific parameters and

5415
03:07:54,720 --> 03:07:55,359
so on

5416
03:07:55,359 --> 03:07:57,680
um so that's different options you can

5417
03:07:57,680 --> 03:08:00,000
either directly the json files

5418
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:02,960
or you can contribute back there and and

5419
03:08:02,960 --> 03:08:05,040
you can't

5420
03:08:05,040 --> 03:08:07,439
so that's really just contextualization

5421
03:08:07,439 --> 03:08:09,040
but another thing that you really want

5422
03:08:09,040 --> 03:08:11,359
usually to do is to

5423
03:08:11,359 --> 03:08:13,840
create custom objects so what we have

5424
03:08:13,840 --> 03:08:15,359
seen yesterday

5425
03:08:15,359 --> 03:08:17,920
we were having person object email

5426
03:08:17,920 --> 03:08:19,680
object file object and those one are

5427
03:08:19,680 --> 03:08:22,720
coming from a library

5428
03:08:22,720 --> 03:08:26,160
so the thing is in that library you have

5429
03:08:26,160 --> 03:08:30,080
default library on on mist

5430
03:08:30,080 --> 03:08:31,840
so if you go on the object template it's

5431
03:08:31,840 --> 03:08:33,600
basically all the objects there

5432
03:08:33,600 --> 03:08:38,319
so if i take again the person

5433
03:08:38,319 --> 03:08:41,680
object we basically have a template

5434
03:08:41,680 --> 03:08:42,560
there

5435
03:08:42,560 --> 03:08:45,359
with things like for example suspect a

5436
03:08:45,359 --> 03:08:47,439
victim a culprit whatever

5437
03:08:47,439 --> 03:08:50,479
and all of all those parameters

5438
03:08:50,479 --> 03:08:52,160
this is not coming from nowhere but you

5439
03:08:52,160 --> 03:08:54,160
can customize it and that's

5440
03:08:54,160 --> 03:08:57,359
really really easy to do it so

5441
03:08:57,359 --> 03:09:01,120
it's again a json file we have again a

5442
03:09:01,120 --> 03:09:03,439
repository this one is a sub modules

5443
03:09:03,439 --> 03:09:06,880
on mist itself and

5444
03:09:06,880 --> 03:09:10,319
i'll take the object here for

5445
03:09:10,319 --> 03:09:11,840
person you see that we have a lot of

5446
03:09:11,840 --> 03:09:14,080
mode of existing object template

5447
03:09:14,080 --> 03:09:15,600
i'll just take personal flyers you can

5448
03:09:15,600 --> 03:09:17,600
see the um

5449
03:09:17,600 --> 03:09:20,239
description and this one is describing

5450
03:09:20,239 --> 03:09:21,439
how the object should be

5451
03:09:21,439 --> 03:09:23,600
and that's basically it so if you want

5452
03:09:23,600 --> 03:09:25,120
to customize

5453
03:09:25,120 --> 03:09:28,800
misp for as in your own object

5454
03:09:28,800 --> 03:09:30,239
you can create an object template in

5455
03:09:30,239 --> 03:09:32,960
json add it into your mix instance and

5456
03:09:32,960 --> 03:09:34,239
then you have a complete new mixed

5457
03:09:34,239 --> 03:09:35,279
object so you can

5458
03:09:35,279 --> 03:09:38,319
really fine tune the object the only

5459
03:09:38,319 --> 03:09:39,680
restriction there is

5460
03:09:39,680 --> 03:09:41,840
each of the attributes need to be an

5461
03:09:41,840 --> 03:09:44,000
existing mist type we have around

5462
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:47,439
250 missed type

5463
03:09:47,439 --> 03:09:50,319
we are regularly adding some new

5464
03:09:50,319 --> 03:09:51,840
depending of the people requesting

5465
03:09:51,840 --> 03:09:52,800
different things

5466
03:09:52,800 --> 03:09:54,160
if you see missing one but you have some

5467
03:09:54,160 --> 03:09:57,600
basic ones like text

5468
03:09:57,600 --> 03:10:00,399
numerical values uh integers things like

5469
03:10:00,399 --> 03:10:00,960
that

5470
03:10:00,960 --> 03:10:03,680
uh you have for example uh things like

5471
03:10:03,680 --> 03:10:05,040
person itself

5472
03:10:05,040 --> 03:10:07,920
credit card number iban and software and

5473
03:10:07,920 --> 03:10:09,760
you can compose new objectives so for

5474
03:10:09,760 --> 03:10:11,279
example if you want to make an object

5475
03:10:11,279 --> 03:10:12,960
for person

5476
03:10:12,960 --> 03:10:14,880
and passport number you can just like

5477
03:10:14,880 --> 03:10:17,040
build it together reuse existing one

5478
03:10:17,040 --> 03:10:20,080
or create your your own so

5479
03:10:20,080 --> 03:10:21,359
based on the question of yesterday

5480
03:10:21,359 --> 03:10:23,200
someone was asking about

5481
03:10:23,200 --> 03:10:26,080
can can i customers missed to my own

5482
03:10:26,080 --> 03:10:26,880
needs yes

5483
03:10:26,880 --> 03:10:29,279
for sure and without even changing your

5484
03:10:29,279 --> 03:10:30,160
line of code

5485
03:10:30,160 --> 03:10:31,600
in mist you can do it from the

5486
03:10:31,600 --> 03:10:35,040
taxonomies you can do it from the

5487
03:10:35,040 --> 03:10:38,319
objects galaxies we have some other

5488
03:10:38,319 --> 03:10:39,840
thing that you can even customize like

5489
03:10:39,840 --> 03:10:41,359
notice list and so on which is

5490
03:10:41,359 --> 03:10:44,399
interacting on the user interface but

5491
03:10:44,399 --> 03:10:45,520
you have a large set

5492
03:10:45,520 --> 03:10:48,560
of different

5493
03:10:48,560 --> 03:10:51,600
way of customizing mixed directly and

5494
03:10:51,600 --> 03:10:52,720
then you have obviously

5495
03:10:52,720 --> 03:10:55,359
modules which are external python

5496
03:10:55,359 --> 03:10:56,720
modules that you can

5497
03:10:56,720 --> 03:10:59,120
develop and for example we have seen

5498
03:10:59,120 --> 03:11:00,720
people developing their own python

5499
03:11:00,720 --> 03:11:02,000
module to access for example the

5500
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:03,279
ticketing system

5501
03:11:03,279 --> 03:11:06,399
uh which is directly called uh into

5502
03:11:06,399 --> 03:11:08,960
into uh

5503
03:11:11,760 --> 03:11:13,200
so it was a quick introduction of how

5504
03:11:13,200 --> 03:11:14,960
you can modify myths but maybe i'm

5505
03:11:14,960 --> 03:11:16,399
missing some but it's like

5506
03:11:16,399 --> 03:11:18,479
we have some some slide deck regarding

5507
03:11:18,479 --> 03:11:20,720
this project of creators and so on

5508
03:11:20,720 --> 03:11:24,479
uh i really advise you to have a look on

5509
03:11:24,479 --> 03:11:26,640
the

5510
03:11:26,640 --> 03:11:29,840
training page i'll just show you there

5511
03:11:29,840 --> 03:11:30,399
we have

5512
03:11:30,399 --> 03:11:33,920
complete slide deck for

5513
03:11:33,920 --> 03:11:36,080
for example object creation and so on so

5514
03:11:36,080 --> 03:11:37,760
for example object template

5515
03:11:37,760 --> 03:11:40,800
if slides explain how to do it same with

5516
03:11:40,800 --> 03:11:41,680
the

5517
03:11:41,680 --> 03:11:44,880
galaxy 2.0 same

5518
03:11:44,880 --> 03:11:46,880
some stuff you can you can basically

5519
03:11:46,880 --> 03:11:48,080
here because

5520
03:11:48,080 --> 03:11:50,640
for example decaying indicators i was

5521
03:11:50,640 --> 03:11:51,920
quick there but if you want to see the

5522
03:11:51,920 --> 03:11:52,800
formula

5523
03:11:52,800 --> 03:11:55,279
or it's applying and so on uh check the

5524
03:11:55,279 --> 03:11:57,200
slide deck it's really containing a lot

5525
03:11:57,200 --> 03:11:58,080
of

5526
03:11:58,080 --> 03:12:01,039
a lot of information

5527
03:12:03,680 --> 03:12:05,439
okay so that was a quick quick

5528
03:12:05,439 --> 03:12:07,200
introduction on that aspect

5529
03:12:07,200 --> 03:12:10,399
uh so text name is galaxy it's a warning

5530
03:12:10,399 --> 03:12:11,120
list it's

5531
03:12:11,120 --> 03:12:13,120
maybe one that you you want to customize

5532
03:12:13,120 --> 03:12:15,359
it to um

5533
03:12:15,359 --> 03:12:18,479
you have different different differently

5534
03:12:18,479 --> 03:12:20,800
enabled i don't know what we have

5535
03:12:20,800 --> 03:12:22,239
enabled but i can i can

5536
03:12:22,239 --> 03:12:24,160
make a quick show because yes yesterday

5537
03:12:24,160 --> 03:12:26,160
we didn't show the warnings

5538
03:12:26,160 --> 03:12:29,520
so what what i will do is i will create

5539
03:12:29,520 --> 03:12:31,840
add an attribute with the dns on our

5540
03:12:31,840 --> 03:12:33,200
activities

5541
03:12:33,200 --> 03:12:35,600
you can just check everyone knows this

5542
03:12:35,600 --> 03:12:36,319
apic

5543
03:12:36,319 --> 03:12:40,479
if it's a google record server

5544
03:12:40,479 --> 03:12:42,000
i will just set the introductory

5545
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:43,279
detection system i put it as an

5546
03:12:43,279 --> 03:12:44,800
indicator there and you see

5547
03:12:44,800 --> 03:12:47,680
automatically misp is telling me oh be

5548
03:12:47,680 --> 03:12:48,399
careful

5549
03:12:48,399 --> 03:12:51,359
we have a potential warning of an

5550
03:12:51,359 --> 03:12:52,960
existing false positive there

5551
03:12:52,960 --> 03:12:55,840
and nothing is the case 888 is part of

5552
03:12:55,840 --> 03:12:56,720
one of the list

5553
03:12:56,720 --> 03:13:00,640
of known public ipv4 public dns resolver

5554
03:13:00,640 --> 03:13:02,560
so it's giving an idea already when you

5555
03:13:02,560 --> 03:13:04,080
start to enter information into this

5556
03:13:04,080 --> 03:13:04,640
okay

5557
03:13:04,640 --> 03:13:07,439
if you are careful there it might be uh

5558
03:13:07,439 --> 03:13:08,960
it might be something like

5559
03:13:08,960 --> 03:13:10,800
transitive or it might be something that

5560
03:13:10,800 --> 03:13:12,560
you don't want to publish and so on

5561
03:13:12,560 --> 03:13:15,439
so one list can be used for that we we

5562
03:13:15,439 --> 03:13:17,439
come with a

5563
03:13:17,439 --> 03:13:20,479
pretty large list of warning lists which

5564
03:13:20,479 --> 03:13:24,160
again json file that you can customize

5565
03:13:24,160 --> 03:13:29,840
i can quickly show you the

5566
03:13:34,399 --> 03:13:39,200
so this one is all the list

5567
03:13:39,200 --> 03:13:41,760
see that we have a specific list of of

5568
03:13:41,760 --> 03:13:44,720
things like for example of vh cluster

5569
03:13:44,720 --> 03:13:47,920
we have some for phone numbers this one

5570
03:13:47,920 --> 03:13:50,160
is is quite

5571
03:13:50,160 --> 03:13:52,080
funny it's a list of phone numbers that

5572
03:13:52,080 --> 03:13:53,359
are used for example for

5573
03:13:53,359 --> 03:13:56,160
movies and stuff like that so if someone

5574
03:13:56,160 --> 03:13:57,840
is entering effect phone numbers you can

5575
03:13:57,840 --> 03:13:59,200
directly spot it

5576
03:13:59,200 --> 03:14:02,319
without at least the one in list um we

5577
03:14:02,319 --> 03:14:02,800
have

5578
03:14:02,800 --> 03:14:04,960
plenty of of lisa you can create your

5579
03:14:04,960 --> 03:14:06,319
own um

5580
03:14:06,319 --> 03:14:09,040
but it's really really useful especially

5581
03:14:09,040 --> 03:14:10,160
for example we have the one from

5582
03:14:10,160 --> 03:14:12,239
microsoft office 365.

5583
03:14:12,239 --> 03:14:13,680
it's very common that when you do

5584
03:14:13,680 --> 03:14:15,840
analysis and so on you know one it is

5585
03:14:15,840 --> 03:14:16,560
slipped

5586
03:14:16,560 --> 03:14:18,960
out of your list and it's basically a

5587
03:14:18,960 --> 03:14:21,120
backend system of microsoft or some

5588
03:14:21,120 --> 03:14:23,439
other and you can directly spot it

5589
03:14:23,439 --> 03:14:26,560
um in addition to that you sit on the

5590
03:14:26,560 --> 03:14:28,319
interface but it's

5591
03:14:28,319 --> 03:14:30,720
enabled on the api too so you can

5592
03:14:30,720 --> 03:14:31,680
enforce

5593
03:14:31,680 --> 03:14:34,080
the warning list directly on the api so

5594
03:14:34,080 --> 03:14:36,000
what is the benefit there

5595
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:38,880
so instead of of just having a kind of

5596
03:14:38,880 --> 03:14:40,560
warning on the user interface

5597
03:14:40,560 --> 03:14:43,760
it's already filtered out by misp

5598
03:14:43,760 --> 03:14:46,720
uh when you are feeding those lists into

5599
03:14:46,720 --> 03:14:47,200
your

5600
03:14:47,200 --> 03:14:49,600
ids protective tools and so on so which

5601
03:14:49,600 --> 03:14:51,120
is like a quick gain because you can

5602
03:14:51,120 --> 03:14:51,680
okay

5603
03:14:51,680 --> 03:14:53,840
if you have really obvious warning lists

5604
03:14:53,840 --> 03:14:56,399
they are automatically blocked

5605
03:14:56,399 --> 03:14:57,920
we have seen different user warning

5606
03:14:57,920 --> 03:15:00,800
lists i know an ic for example which is

5607
03:15:00,800 --> 03:15:03,439
putting their pack and iprs is there

5608
03:15:03,439 --> 03:15:06,640
for tourism first to not uh block them

5609
03:15:06,640 --> 03:15:08,479
when they are doing a firewall rules and

5610
03:15:08,479 --> 03:15:09,359
so on on

5611
03:15:09,359 --> 03:15:11,359
on on some specifically proceeds like

5612
03:15:11,359 --> 03:15:12,880
management ips

5613
03:15:12,880 --> 03:15:14,880
but in addition to that if when they

5614
03:15:14,880 --> 03:15:17,279
have like working on a case

5615
03:15:17,279 --> 03:15:19,279
if it's eating one of their critical

5616
03:15:19,279 --> 03:15:20,720
infrastructures like oh

5617
03:15:20,720 --> 03:15:22,479
maybe we have to have a careful look on

5618
03:15:22,479 --> 03:15:24,080
this one and so you can

5619
03:15:24,080 --> 03:15:25,840
use it as a kind of warning okay it's

5620
03:15:25,840 --> 03:15:27,439
maybe false positive but you can use the

5621
03:15:27,439 --> 03:15:28,720
kind of warning too

5622
03:15:28,720 --> 03:15:30,479
like okay it's something that i really

5623
03:15:30,479 --> 03:15:34,000
need to dig into and have a look at and

5624
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:34,800
those these are

5625
03:15:34,800 --> 03:15:37,359
again different files so you can do it

5626
03:15:37,359 --> 03:15:38,479
locally

5627
03:15:38,479 --> 03:15:41,279
customize it and then update it and if

5628
03:15:41,279 --> 03:15:42,160
you want to share

5629
03:15:42,160 --> 03:15:43,920
with us some warning lists for specific

5630
03:15:43,920 --> 03:15:45,439
topic and so on for example we have a

5631
03:15:45,439 --> 03:15:46,560
list of

5632
03:15:46,560 --> 03:15:48,880
all those banking websites uh which

5633
03:15:48,880 --> 03:15:50,239
might leak at some point when you are

5634
03:15:50,239 --> 03:15:51,359
doing reversing

5635
03:15:51,359 --> 03:15:53,120
and you end up into like having one of

5636
03:15:53,120 --> 03:15:55,279
these official domains of the domain

5637
03:15:55,279 --> 03:15:57,680
of the bank itself in the miss even and

5638
03:15:57,680 --> 03:15:59,439
you can get a warning

5639
03:15:59,439 --> 03:16:02,560
and not share it and this warning list

5640
03:16:02,560 --> 03:16:04,720
will be enabled only when ids flag is

5641
03:16:04,720 --> 03:16:05,359
set

5642
03:16:05,359 --> 03:16:08,000
because if you unset the ids flag we act

5643
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:10,560
as a kind of contextual information

5644
03:16:10,560 --> 03:16:13,279
and then it will not be fed into

5645
03:16:13,279 --> 03:16:17,200
automatic systems

5646
03:16:17,200 --> 03:16:19,279
okay i think that's basically it for for

5647
03:16:19,279 --> 03:16:22,000
taxonomies galaxies and warning lists

5648
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:23,359
andras you see something else i'm

5649
03:16:23,359 --> 03:16:25,120
missing there yeah

5650
03:16:25,120 --> 03:16:28,479
no and i think we've covered most of the

5651
03:16:28,479 --> 03:16:29,439
topics so

5652
03:16:29,439 --> 03:16:31,120
maybe we can have some time for

5653
03:16:31,120 --> 03:16:32,640
questions and then

5654
03:16:32,640 --> 03:16:35,520
yeah sure sure yeah so if you have any

5655
03:16:35,520 --> 03:16:36,319
questions

5656
03:16:36,319 --> 03:16:39,359
don't hesitate to use a q a application

5657
03:16:39,359 --> 03:16:41,439
so even the chat uh

5658
03:16:41,439 --> 03:16:43,120
we are really open to different

5659
03:16:43,120 --> 03:16:44,479
questions

5660
03:16:44,479 --> 03:16:46,399
at the same time maybe i can talk about

5661
03:16:46,399 --> 03:16:48,880
what we are working on and

5662
03:16:48,880 --> 03:16:51,840
first of all we are working on a huge

5663
03:16:51,840 --> 03:16:54,239
revamp on the backend infrastructure

5664
03:16:54,239 --> 03:16:55,920
because we are moving into a new

5665
03:16:55,920 --> 03:16:58,160
framework for the backend this one is

5666
03:16:58,160 --> 03:17:00,800
not that much visible but it's a

5667
03:17:00,800 --> 03:17:03,359
quite heavy work on on on on the

5668
03:17:03,359 --> 03:17:06,319
refactoring of misspent song

5669
03:17:06,319 --> 03:17:08,800
obviously we are doing various things so

5670
03:17:08,800 --> 03:17:10,319
um

5671
03:17:10,319 --> 03:17:12,479
they are obviously a update into a new

5672
03:17:12,479 --> 03:17:13,920
feature that is like

5673
03:17:13,920 --> 03:17:17,120
continuous uh integrations uh thing that

5674
03:17:17,120 --> 03:17:18,239
we are working in that

5675
03:17:18,239 --> 03:17:19,760
in the parallel we are working on a

5676
03:17:19,760 --> 03:17:22,080
project called celebrate

5677
03:17:22,080 --> 03:17:26,420
um which provides um

5678
03:17:26,420 --> 03:17:28,080
[Music]

5679
03:17:28,080 --> 03:17:32,000
a way to have for example sharing groups

5680
03:17:32,000 --> 03:17:35,600
uh organization and so on on uh

5681
03:17:35,600 --> 03:17:38,560
directory services and it's already

5682
03:17:38,560 --> 03:17:40,319
integrated we have some

5683
03:17:40,319 --> 03:17:43,760
it's called a cerebral there

5684
03:17:43,760 --> 03:17:47,520
and you can have a kind of um

5685
03:17:47,520 --> 03:17:50,160
dedicated directory uh and it's

5686
03:17:50,160 --> 03:17:51,120
something that is like

5687
03:17:51,120 --> 03:17:52,800
very interesting for isaac when you have

5688
03:17:52,800 --> 03:17:54,239
multiple myths and you have a kind of

5689
03:17:54,239 --> 03:17:55,520
sharing committee

5690
03:17:55,520 --> 03:17:57,120
it's interesting for first for example

5691
03:17:57,120 --> 03:18:00,319
to we plan to have one for them too

5692
03:18:00,319 --> 03:18:02,960
where you can manage directly your

5693
03:18:02,960 --> 03:18:04,000
organizations

5694
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:06,239
and users there so that's the thing that

5695
03:18:06,239 --> 03:18:07,760
you are working on

5696
03:18:07,760 --> 03:18:09,760
we have plenty of parallel projects

5697
03:18:09,760 --> 03:18:12,000
there one of our colleagues right now is

5698
03:18:12,000 --> 03:18:14,239
working on an open api

5699
03:18:14,239 --> 03:18:16,960
so that means uh we will expose from

5700
03:18:16,960 --> 03:18:17,439
missed

5701
03:18:17,439 --> 03:18:20,960
the open api aspect we have

5702
03:18:20,960 --> 03:18:23,439
plenty of outgoing work on the user

5703
03:18:23,439 --> 03:18:24,479
interface and

5704
03:18:24,479 --> 03:18:27,520
it's a slow move because we change the

5705
03:18:27,520 --> 03:18:30,880
templating aspect there because

5706
03:18:30,880 --> 03:18:32,640
the software itself is becoming bigger

5707
03:18:32,640 --> 03:18:34,560
and bigger and sometimes we have to

5708
03:18:34,560 --> 03:18:35,120
revamp

5709
03:18:35,120 --> 03:18:36,399
the user interface to make it more

5710
03:18:36,399 --> 03:18:38,560
convenient um

5711
03:18:38,560 --> 03:18:42,720
we have a a long set of of of project

5712
03:18:42,720 --> 03:18:43,600
and so on the

5713
03:18:43,600 --> 03:18:46,319
on the user interface um so thing that

5714
03:18:46,319 --> 03:18:48,880
figures and introduces galaxy 2.0

5715
03:18:48,880 --> 03:18:51,520
where you can really uh customize uh

5716
03:18:51,520 --> 03:18:53,359
galaxies and so on but uh

5717
03:18:53,359 --> 03:18:55,439
we might go a bit further there on

5718
03:18:55,439 --> 03:18:57,040
integrations we we are planning

5719
03:18:57,040 --> 03:18:58,560
integration with another project that we

5720
03:18:58,560 --> 03:19:00,319
are working on called cycad

5721
03:19:00,319 --> 03:19:02,080
um for having those kind of share

5722
03:19:02,080 --> 03:19:04,720
library and as an expansion not only are

5723
03:19:04,720 --> 03:19:06,960
the ones done by myths but others

5724
03:19:06,960 --> 03:19:10,000
and there's the questions uh that's a

5725
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:10,720
good one

5726
03:19:10,720 --> 03:19:12,960
yeah so the question question is what is

5727
03:19:12,960 --> 03:19:14,800
the difference between a community and

5728
03:19:14,800 --> 03:19:16,000
the sharing

5729
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:19,120
and the sharing group um and the

5730
03:19:19,120 --> 03:19:20,560
sharing group have access to more than

5731
03:19:20,560 --> 03:19:21,840
one community this is indeed a little

5732
03:19:21,840 --> 03:19:22,640
bit tricky

5733
03:19:22,640 --> 03:19:24,640
so what we call a community in general

5734
03:19:24,640 --> 03:19:26,239
is anyone that has access to a miss

5735
03:19:26,239 --> 03:19:29,040
server so anyone that gets access on on

5736
03:19:29,040 --> 03:19:29,439
the miss

5737
03:19:29,439 --> 03:19:31,439
private sector uh communities or ms

5738
03:19:31,439 --> 03:19:33,840
princeton's or is part of the community

5739
03:19:33,840 --> 03:19:35,520
however we can further cluster the

5740
03:19:35,520 --> 03:19:36,160
access

5741
03:19:36,160 --> 03:19:38,560
uh for the different members within this

5742
03:19:38,560 --> 03:19:39,359
community

5743
03:19:39,359 --> 03:19:42,399
using sharing groups so so

5744
03:19:42,399 --> 03:19:44,560
it's we don't really call sharing groups

5745
03:19:44,560 --> 03:19:45,680
communities

5746
03:19:45,680 --> 03:19:48,080
but they can be the representations of

5747
03:19:48,080 --> 03:19:48,880
data sets

5748
03:19:48,880 --> 03:19:51,279
for a community a sub-community so for

5749
03:19:51,279 --> 03:19:52,800
example in our case we have the private

5750
03:19:52,800 --> 03:19:54,319
sector miss vincent's

5751
03:19:54,319 --> 03:19:56,880
where we have a lot of different users

5752
03:19:56,880 --> 03:19:59,120
and some of those users belong to an

5753
03:19:59,120 --> 03:20:00,800
organization that is in the financial

5754
03:20:00,800 --> 03:20:02,479
sector for example in luxembourg

5755
03:20:02,479 --> 03:20:03,920
and they create a sharing group where

5756
03:20:03,920 --> 03:20:05,600
they're only sharing information

5757
03:20:05,600 --> 03:20:07,040
that is meant for the lux and mortgage

5758
03:20:07,040 --> 03:20:09,439
private financial sector

5759
03:20:09,439 --> 03:20:11,600
with the sharing group and only they can

5760
03:20:11,600 --> 03:20:13,520
see that data

5761
03:20:13,520 --> 03:20:15,439
so when you're talking about the miss

5762
03:20:15,439 --> 03:20:16,960
community really it's just the whole

5763
03:20:16,960 --> 03:20:17,359
thing

5764
03:20:17,359 --> 03:20:20,000
together and then you can have actual

5765
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:21,520
communities that are

5766
03:20:21,520 --> 03:20:23,439
participating and sharing and

5767
03:20:23,439 --> 03:20:25,520
self-organizing into smaller so yeah

5768
03:20:25,520 --> 03:20:28,640
to take maybe a like a visual example

5769
03:20:28,640 --> 03:20:30,399
imagine that you have a miss for your i

5770
03:20:30,399 --> 03:20:32,960
don't know your village or your city

5771
03:20:32,960 --> 03:20:35,279
and within the city you might have a

5772
03:20:35,279 --> 03:20:36,239
suburbs

5773
03:20:36,239 --> 03:20:38,960
or specific area and you can have

5774
03:20:38,960 --> 03:20:41,359
sharing groups within those areas so

5775
03:20:41,359 --> 03:20:44,239
really the community per se is like

5776
03:20:44,239 --> 03:20:46,160
having access to a mixed instance and

5777
03:20:46,160 --> 03:20:47,359
then you can

5778
03:20:47,359 --> 03:20:49,279
refresh that in different sectors that's

5779
03:20:49,279 --> 03:20:52,640
uh nothing correct

5780
03:20:53,840 --> 03:20:56,479
yeah indeed so yeah kind of because

5781
03:20:56,479 --> 03:20:57,600
because on the other hand

5782
03:20:57,600 --> 03:20:59,680
a sharing group can it can span more

5783
03:20:59,680 --> 03:21:00,880
than one community

5784
03:21:00,880 --> 03:21:02,319
so you can create a sharing group where

5785
03:21:02,319 --> 03:21:04,239
you involve organizations on your local

5786
03:21:04,239 --> 03:21:04,720
instance

5787
03:21:04,720 --> 03:21:06,319
as well as other communities out there

5788
03:21:06,319 --> 03:21:08,479
as well and then the data is propagated

5789
03:21:08,479 --> 03:21:09,600
and they're also involved in the

5790
03:21:09,600 --> 03:21:10,000
community

5791
03:21:10,000 --> 03:21:11,520
so it's just a different way of

5792
03:21:11,520 --> 03:21:14,000
clustering the organizations

5793
03:21:14,000 --> 03:21:17,040
yeah so if you look at the map you you

5794
03:21:17,040 --> 03:21:17,680
have

5795
03:21:17,680 --> 03:21:20,000
community that are really the instance

5796
03:21:20,000 --> 03:21:20,960
and the people that are directly

5797
03:21:20,960 --> 03:21:23,200
connected and the sharing group could be

5798
03:21:23,200 --> 03:21:26,319
an extension of multiple missed

5799
03:21:26,319 --> 03:21:27,439
instances because it's

5800
03:21:27,439 --> 03:21:29,439
flowing into different different

5801
03:21:29,439 --> 03:21:31,920
communities

5802
03:21:33,760 --> 03:21:39,840
but in this very good question indeed

5803
03:21:45,600 --> 03:21:47,680
any other questions uh galaxy community

5804
03:21:47,680 --> 03:21:49,439
yeah galaxy is something completely

5805
03:21:49,439 --> 03:21:50,560
different so galaxies

5806
03:21:50,560 --> 03:21:54,239
is basically just a knowledge-based

5807
03:21:54,239 --> 03:21:55,760
library

5808
03:21:55,760 --> 03:21:58,560
so galaxy clusters so for example threat

5809
03:21:58,560 --> 03:22:01,359
actors as a concept for us our galaxy

5810
03:22:01,359 --> 03:22:03,600
then individual threat actors are galaxy

5811
03:22:03,600 --> 03:22:06,080
clusters within that galaxy

5812
03:22:06,080 --> 03:22:07,840
so here here alex is showing the list of

5813
03:22:07,840 --> 03:22:10,239
galaxies out there for example we have

5814
03:22:10,239 --> 03:22:12,560
attack patterns from mitre you have

5815
03:22:12,560 --> 03:22:14,560
lists of countries that is also a galaxy

5816
03:22:14,560 --> 03:22:16,960
so it's a general concept

5817
03:22:16,960 --> 03:22:19,760
of knowledge base elements and then each

5818
03:22:19,760 --> 03:22:21,200
of those clusters are basically

5819
03:22:21,200 --> 03:22:22,880
individual data points

5820
03:22:22,880 --> 03:22:26,640
uh how does the feed overall heat map

5821
03:22:26,640 --> 03:22:28,399
actually work and is it real time

5822
03:22:28,399 --> 03:22:30,640
so the way it works is uh it uses the

5823
03:22:30,640 --> 03:22:32,479
caches so it's not real time it's using

5824
03:22:32,479 --> 03:22:34,160
the cache data that you're pulling

5825
03:22:34,160 --> 03:22:35,200
so that means that if you want to

5826
03:22:35,200 --> 03:22:37,600
generate a fresh data set for your heat

5827
03:22:37,600 --> 03:22:39,680
map you need to pull in the new caches

5828
03:22:39,680 --> 03:22:41,279
once you pull in the caches it's using

5829
03:22:41,279 --> 03:22:42,720
those to do the overlay or

5830
03:22:42,720 --> 03:22:46,080
between the different uh data sets so

5831
03:22:46,080 --> 03:22:48,800
i think for for example for uh for the

5832
03:22:48,800 --> 03:22:50,640
for the default set of feeds i think

5833
03:22:50,640 --> 03:22:52,239
caching the whole thing takes something

5834
03:22:52,239 --> 03:22:52,640
like

5835
03:22:52,640 --> 03:22:56,479
two minutes or so um so it's quite fast

5836
03:22:56,479 --> 03:22:58,800
uh for misp servers it's obviously a bit

5837
03:22:58,800 --> 03:23:00,880
slower but it's also not that slow so it

5838
03:23:00,880 --> 03:23:02,720
will take a few minutes per server

5839
03:23:02,720 --> 03:23:04,800
so if you want to generate a fresh full

5840
03:23:04,800 --> 03:23:06,479
cache of all data sets and you have

5841
03:23:06,479 --> 03:23:08,319
several missed connections

5842
03:23:08,319 --> 03:23:10,160
several feeds that you're ingesting or

5843
03:23:10,160 --> 03:23:12,080
several dozens of feeds like here

5844
03:23:12,080 --> 03:23:14,160
and then it will take you like five to

5845
03:23:14,160 --> 03:23:15,920
ten minutes to generate a new full set

5846
03:23:15,920 --> 03:23:16,800
of caches

5847
03:23:16,800 --> 03:23:18,640
and then you can do an overlap analysis

5848
03:23:18,640 --> 03:23:20,080
of the current state

5849
03:23:20,080 --> 03:23:21,920
but if you if you put a new server it

5850
03:23:21,920 --> 03:23:23,760
will be updated so you don't need to

5851
03:23:23,760 --> 03:23:31,840
do a full update of the of the mapping

5852
03:23:42,479 --> 03:23:44,479
yeah when you feed with 10k uh different

5853
03:23:44,479 --> 03:23:45,520
attributes where can

5854
03:23:45,520 --> 03:23:47,520
we see what type of attributes we

5855
03:23:47,520 --> 03:23:49,120
fetched um

5856
03:23:49,120 --> 03:23:51,359
okay that is a good question so if it's

5857
03:23:51,359 --> 03:23:52,960
a mis-style feed

5858
03:23:52,960 --> 03:23:54,800
it is indeed more difficult because

5859
03:23:54,800 --> 03:23:56,800
they're generated as normal events

5860
03:23:56,800 --> 03:23:59,680
so so with events you know you can get

5861
03:23:59,680 --> 03:24:02,000
all sorts of data in there

5862
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:03,520
so it's a little bit trickier when it

5863
03:24:03,520 --> 03:24:05,040
comes to feeds from csv

5864
03:24:05,040 --> 03:24:06,319
feeds and so on it's a bit more

5865
03:24:06,319 --> 03:24:08,560
straightforward because everything goes

5866
03:24:08,560 --> 03:24:11,120
into a single event in the

5867
03:24:11,120 --> 03:24:12,720
feats end a little bit easier to see

5868
03:24:12,720 --> 03:24:14,160
what got pulled in

5869
03:24:14,160 --> 03:24:17,359
uh for the other one for uh for miss

5870
03:24:17,359 --> 03:24:19,200
feeds uh it's going to be a pretty broad

5871
03:24:19,200 --> 03:24:21,920
spectrum update that you're getting

5872
03:24:21,920 --> 03:24:24,560
yeah we're getting the question of guest

5873
03:24:24,560 --> 03:24:26,239
yes it's possible so

5874
03:24:26,239 --> 03:24:28,800
you can for example have custom galaxy

5875
03:24:28,800 --> 03:24:30,000
so if you fall

5876
03:24:30,000 --> 03:24:32,319
and you can distribute you can even say

5877
03:24:32,319 --> 03:24:34,000
or you disreview the galaxy just like

5878
03:24:34,000 --> 03:24:35,600
the event so you can say for example i

5879
03:24:35,600 --> 03:24:37,439
want to share it within that community

5880
03:24:37,439 --> 03:24:39,359
so if i have my personal galaxy for

5881
03:24:39,359 --> 03:24:40,560
tradators for example

5882
03:24:40,560 --> 03:24:42,560
i can't share it with for example the

5883
03:24:42,560 --> 03:24:43,920
community garage

5884
03:24:43,920 --> 03:24:46,080
will basically get all those other

5885
03:24:46,080 --> 03:24:47,359
communities so you can do that

5886
03:24:47,359 --> 03:24:48,800
you can you can even use sharing groups

5887
03:24:48,800 --> 03:24:51,520
for example so that means the library

5888
03:24:51,520 --> 03:24:54,800
of galaxies could benefit of exactly the

5889
03:24:54,800 --> 03:24:55,439
same shelling

5890
03:24:55,439 --> 03:24:58,160
we didn't show that but we didn't and

5891
03:24:58,160 --> 03:24:59,279
and maybe one thing to

5892
03:24:59,279 --> 03:25:00,800
to explain here as well as we have two

5893
03:25:00,800 --> 03:25:02,800
layers of galaxies one of the layers is

5894
03:25:02,800 --> 03:25:04,399
basically everything that we as miss

5895
03:25:04,399 --> 03:25:06,960
project provide by default in every miss

5896
03:25:06,960 --> 03:25:08,319
vincent so when you install miss you

5897
03:25:08,319 --> 03:25:09,760
will get a set of galaxies

5898
03:25:09,760 --> 03:25:11,439
and the other set is what alex mentioned

5899
03:25:11,439 --> 03:25:13,760
you can create your own galaxy clusters

5900
03:25:13,760 --> 03:25:15,600
ad hoc so if you're tracking a new

5901
03:25:15,600 --> 03:25:17,439
adversary that is not described in any

5902
03:25:17,439 --> 03:25:18,880
of the libraries you can quickly create

5903
03:25:18,880 --> 03:25:20,560
a galaxy cluster for them

5904
03:25:20,560 --> 03:25:22,800
or you can create a complete new concept

5905
03:25:22,800 --> 03:25:24,399
as well and indeed those

5906
03:25:24,399 --> 03:25:26,319
can be published and shared the same way

5907
03:25:26,319 --> 03:25:28,000
as events will get shared

5908
03:25:28,000 --> 03:25:29,520
so when you create your own galaxy

5909
03:25:29,520 --> 03:25:31,359
cluster then you can set distribution

5910
03:25:31,359 --> 03:25:32,560
level and you can share it with the

5911
03:25:32,560 --> 03:25:33,359
community

5912
03:25:33,359 --> 03:25:35,760
so here's an example of a custom one

5913
03:25:35,760 --> 03:25:37,680
which is a fork of an existing one

5914
03:25:37,680 --> 03:25:39,680
i think or is this the default one

5915
03:25:39,680 --> 03:25:40,880
that's

5916
03:25:40,880 --> 03:25:44,160
a default one yeah

5917
03:25:44,239 --> 03:25:46,319
so so this one would act like an event

5918
03:25:46,319 --> 03:25:47,760
you can publish it and it will be

5919
03:25:47,760 --> 03:25:48,960
synchronized based on the same

5920
03:25:48,960 --> 03:25:50,319
distribution settings as

5921
03:25:50,319 --> 03:25:51,600
well as how events would get

5922
03:25:51,600 --> 03:25:54,000
synchronized and you can set the

5923
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:55,840
distribution as you like uh

5924
03:25:55,840 --> 03:25:58,479
like like the others and the same so

5925
03:25:58,479 --> 03:25:59,920
that means you can really have

5926
03:25:59,920 --> 03:26:01,359
so like rush mentioned we have this

5927
03:26:01,359 --> 03:26:03,760
galaxy default layer which is like the

5928
03:26:03,760 --> 03:26:04,160
one that

5929
03:26:04,160 --> 03:26:07,359
enables um a on your wrist instance or

5930
03:26:07,359 --> 03:26:09,200
you can enable what you want but

5931
03:26:09,200 --> 03:26:11,120
basically there and then you can extend

5932
03:26:11,120 --> 03:26:13,680
it uh or create your own and then uh

5933
03:26:13,680 --> 03:26:15,920
decide to share it or not that's uh just

5934
03:26:15,920 --> 03:26:18,239
just like and it's independent

5935
03:26:18,239 --> 03:26:21,520
from um the synchronization of event

5936
03:26:21,520 --> 03:26:24,319
so we didn't mention that but if you go

5937
03:26:24,319 --> 03:26:25,520
to the server

5938
03:26:25,520 --> 03:26:27,680
you have an option to share that so it's

5939
03:26:27,680 --> 03:26:28,800
an additional measure

5940
03:26:28,800 --> 03:26:31,600
in case and you can basically push and

5941
03:26:31,600 --> 03:26:34,640
pull galaxy cluster

5942
03:26:36,080 --> 03:26:39,039
there is another question

5943
03:26:39,840 --> 03:26:43,040
about the enabling of the caching so

5944
03:26:43,040 --> 03:26:46,000
when you enable feed caching it will not

5945
03:26:46,000 --> 03:26:47,040
do anything

5946
03:26:47,040 --> 03:26:49,279
at that point so you need to click on

5947
03:26:49,279 --> 03:26:50,080
the top of the

5948
03:26:50,080 --> 03:26:53,040
table there is a button for cache all

5949
03:26:53,040 --> 03:26:53,520
field

5950
03:26:53,520 --> 03:26:56,160
feeds or fetch all feeds so if you just

5951
03:26:56,160 --> 03:26:57,680
want to cache then it's a caching button

5952
03:26:57,680 --> 03:26:59,040
that you need to press

5953
03:26:59,040 --> 03:27:01,359
now if you go to the automation page so

5954
03:27:01,359 --> 03:27:03,120
normally i'm having to click on the

5955
03:27:03,120 --> 03:27:04,960
system you wouldn't have to just

5956
03:27:04,960 --> 03:27:06,880
do that and only put data in whenever

5957
03:27:06,880 --> 03:27:08,640
you're clicking on an interface

5958
03:27:08,640 --> 03:27:09,840
what you would do is you go to the

5959
03:27:09,840 --> 03:27:11,760
bottom of the automation page there the

5960
03:27:11,760 --> 03:27:13,600
cli commands are explained

5961
03:27:13,600 --> 03:27:15,439
and what you can and there is one called

5962
03:27:15,439 --> 03:27:17,920
cache feeds for quick lookups

5963
03:27:17,920 --> 03:27:19,920
so what you can do is you can you can

5964
03:27:19,920 --> 03:27:21,520
take that cli command

5965
03:27:21,520 --> 03:27:24,080
you can put in a cron job and cache your

5966
03:27:24,080 --> 03:27:24,800
feeds every

5967
03:27:24,800 --> 03:27:29,840
15 minutes for example pretty

5968
03:27:41,200 --> 03:27:43,760
so we started with with taxonomies as a

5969
03:27:43,760 --> 03:27:46,479
way of classifying all those labels

5970
03:27:46,479 --> 03:27:48,000
and then we saw that we have so many

5971
03:27:48,000 --> 03:27:49,760
limitations on

5972
03:27:49,760 --> 03:27:51,439
the complexity of information that you

5973
03:27:51,439 --> 03:27:53,840
want and then galaxy uh and evolution

5974
03:27:53,840 --> 03:27:56,960
nevertheless both are a bit different i

5975
03:27:56,960 --> 03:27:59,200
think galaxy came on on the fact that

5976
03:27:59,200 --> 03:28:00,880
a lot of organizations have different

5977
03:28:00,880 --> 03:28:02,960
way of representing cti

5978
03:28:02,960 --> 03:28:04,800
and that's why we we created galaxy

5979
03:28:04,800 --> 03:28:06,479
perfect but

5980
03:28:06,479 --> 03:28:07,840
taxonomy and galaxies are just

5981
03:28:07,840 --> 03:28:09,760
complementary taxonomy

5982
03:28:09,760 --> 03:28:12,239
is things that you can express in triple

5983
03:28:12,239 --> 03:28:12,880
tag

5984
03:28:12,880 --> 03:28:14,880
like namespace predicate and value

5985
03:28:14,880 --> 03:28:16,960
things that are more complex are

5986
03:28:16,960 --> 03:28:25,839
expressed in galaxy

5987
03:28:26,479 --> 03:28:28,319
uh oh you got a list of taxonomies here

5988
03:28:28,319 --> 03:28:30,720
sure so if you go to the um

5989
03:28:30,720 --> 03:28:32,960
even actions you have the least taxonomy

5990
03:28:32,960 --> 03:28:34,080
then ah

5991
03:28:34,080 --> 03:28:36,319
maybe something that i forgot to mention

5992
03:28:36,319 --> 03:28:38,479
the library the taxonomies are

5993
03:28:38,479 --> 03:28:40,160
are there and you decide which one you

5994
03:28:40,160 --> 03:28:41,359
want to enable you have this kind of

5995
03:28:41,359 --> 03:28:43,840
play button there when you enable it

5996
03:28:43,840 --> 03:28:46,880
then later this will be as a tag

5997
03:28:46,880 --> 03:28:50,239
so there is a coexistence

5998
03:28:50,239 --> 03:28:51,760
either you take your stacks from the

5999
03:28:51,760 --> 03:28:53,840
taxonomies or you have free tag

6000
03:28:53,840 --> 03:28:55,840
and people can use whatever they like

6001
03:28:55,840 --> 03:28:57,359
but the idea

6002
03:28:57,359 --> 03:29:00,160
and that's why we have taxonomies so if

6003
03:29:00,160 --> 03:29:01,520
you want the full story

6004
03:29:01,520 --> 03:29:03,520
the initial history missed you had just

6005
03:29:03,520 --> 03:29:05,040
three tags so that people could just

6006
03:29:05,040 --> 03:29:06,640
entertain the problem is people are

6007
03:29:06,640 --> 03:29:08,160
expressing the same thing in different

6008
03:29:08,160 --> 03:29:09,040
way

6009
03:29:09,040 --> 03:29:11,040
and that's why we start with taxonomies

6010
03:29:11,040 --> 03:29:13,359
then the tsunamis are the libraries of

6011
03:29:13,359 --> 03:29:14,239
those tags

6012
03:29:14,239 --> 03:29:15,359
and then you can share it with those

6013
03:29:15,359 --> 03:29:18,000
ones and when you select a taxonomy then

6014
03:29:18,000 --> 03:29:18,960
afterwards

6015
03:29:18,960 --> 03:29:20,640
they are part of the list tax and if you

6016
03:29:20,640 --> 03:29:22,960
look at the tax itself here

6017
03:29:22,960 --> 03:29:26,960
just take maybe an example

6018
03:29:27,120 --> 03:29:28,720
you see that for example those are

6019
03:29:28,720 --> 03:29:30,399
coming from a taxonomy and this is

6020
03:29:30,399 --> 03:29:31,359
expressed

6021
03:29:31,359 --> 03:29:33,040
if it's not there for example this one

6022
03:29:33,040 --> 03:29:34,800
is circle

6023
03:29:34,800 --> 03:29:37,600
tags you see that it's not there it just

6024
03:29:37,600 --> 03:29:40,160
means that we didn't enable

6025
03:29:40,160 --> 03:29:42,800
the associated taxonomy so if i'm going

6026
03:29:42,800 --> 03:29:44,479
back to the taxonomy list and just

6027
03:29:44,479 --> 03:29:45,920
enable the circular one

6028
03:29:45,920 --> 03:29:48,080
those one will be part of the second

6029
03:29:48,080 --> 03:29:50,479
accident

6030
03:29:53,359 --> 03:29:56,080
um maybe this question uh it's easier to

6031
03:29:56,080 --> 03:29:56,640
pull it

6032
03:29:56,640 --> 03:30:00,000
than to type it so

6033
03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:02,319
what happens uh or your feet pull and

6034
03:30:02,319 --> 03:30:03,600
fetch will overwrite the

6035
03:30:03,600 --> 03:30:05,439
old event in order to avoid duplication

6036
03:30:05,439 --> 03:30:07,359
so fetches

6037
03:30:07,359 --> 03:30:09,279
every time you fetch a source it drops

6038
03:30:09,279 --> 03:30:11,040
the previous state of the of the

6039
03:30:11,040 --> 03:30:13,520
cache and it generates a new one for

6040
03:30:13,520 --> 03:30:15,359
feed pool it's a different story

6041
03:30:15,359 --> 03:30:18,960
for miss pools it will

6042
03:30:18,960 --> 03:30:20,720
use the normal mis-synchronization

6043
03:30:20,720 --> 03:30:22,880
methods of updating existing events

6044
03:30:22,880 --> 03:30:24,960
deduplicating and so on so there's no

6045
03:30:24,960 --> 03:30:26,160
problem there

6046
03:30:26,160 --> 03:30:28,399
for csv and free textile feeds you have

6047
03:30:28,399 --> 03:30:29,840
to be careful how you configure it and

6048
03:30:29,840 --> 03:30:31,120
depends on that you have merge

6049
03:30:31,120 --> 03:30:32,720
strategies that you can configure in the

6050
03:30:32,720 --> 03:30:33,439
feed

6051
03:30:33,439 --> 03:30:35,520
and you basically tell miss whether to

6052
03:30:35,520 --> 03:30:37,279
pull in new events each time

6053
03:30:37,279 --> 03:30:39,840
or update an existing event so what i

6054
03:30:39,840 --> 03:30:41,600
would normally do for most of the feeds

6055
03:30:41,600 --> 03:30:42,560
is i would say

6056
03:30:42,560 --> 03:30:44,160
use a fixed event and keep that one

6057
03:30:44,160 --> 03:30:46,720
updated and when you have a

6058
03:30:46,720 --> 03:30:48,399
and there's a merge strategy that you

6059
03:30:48,399 --> 03:30:50,000
can select and one and one is called

6060
03:30:50,000 --> 03:30:51,439
delta merge i would use that

6061
03:30:51,439 --> 03:30:53,279
what that one does is it aligns your

6062
03:30:53,279 --> 03:30:55,520
local event with the state of the feed

6063
03:30:55,520 --> 03:30:56,960
that means if something is removed from

6064
03:30:56,960 --> 03:30:57,680
the feed

6065
03:30:57,680 --> 03:30:59,439
it will also be removed from the event

6066
03:30:59,439 --> 03:31:01,520
on your instance so that is generally

6067
03:31:01,520 --> 03:31:03,359
also the default for most of them so

6068
03:31:03,359 --> 03:31:05,279
delta merge that's the strategy

6069
03:31:05,279 --> 03:31:07,840
and for target event it should be fixed

6070
03:31:07,840 --> 03:31:08,319
event

6071
03:31:08,319 --> 03:31:10,239
and then it will just keep your local

6072
03:31:10,239 --> 03:31:12,479
event up to date with the remote source

6073
03:31:12,479 --> 03:31:14,800
yeah and to avoid duplication in any

6074
03:31:14,800 --> 03:31:16,399
case if you haven't misfit you don't

6075
03:31:16,399 --> 03:31:17,680
have duplicate because those

6076
03:31:17,680 --> 03:31:22,160
are unique in your enormity

6077
03:31:22,319 --> 03:31:24,840
that's why we have a preference for

6078
03:31:24,840 --> 03:31:27,840
misformative

6079
03:31:37,439 --> 03:31:40,239
there's a question i joined i have just

6080
03:31:40,239 --> 03:31:41,359
installed miss when i've enabled

6081
03:31:41,359 --> 03:31:43,760
something oh we had to edit already

6082
03:31:43,760 --> 03:31:46,239
okay we already answered that that's

6083
03:31:46,239 --> 03:31:48,479
fine

6084
03:31:49,840 --> 03:31:54,800
we've answered this one too

6085
03:31:54,800 --> 03:31:56,800
uh how often our galaxy is updated and

6086
03:31:56,800 --> 03:31:58,239
this is links to being a member of

6087
03:31:58,239 --> 03:32:00,399
specific communities good question

6088
03:32:00,399 --> 03:32:03,120
so first of all the default galaxies are

6089
03:32:03,120 --> 03:32:05,040
updated all the time basically

6090
03:32:05,040 --> 03:32:06,399
generally what we do is whenever there

6091
03:32:06,399 --> 03:32:07,760
is a missed release we update the

6092
03:32:07,760 --> 03:32:09,520
reference the latest set of galaxies

6093
03:32:09,520 --> 03:32:11,200
sometimes you do it more frequently than

6094
03:32:11,200 --> 03:32:12,239
that

6095
03:32:12,239 --> 03:32:14,399
so how often individual galaxies are

6096
03:32:14,399 --> 03:32:16,000
updated really depends on who's

6097
03:32:16,000 --> 03:32:17,359
maintaining it

6098
03:32:17,359 --> 03:32:19,359
so for example when it comes to the

6099
03:32:19,359 --> 03:32:21,200
attack matrix we update every time there

6100
03:32:21,200 --> 03:32:22,640
is new release of attack

6101
03:32:22,640 --> 03:32:24,560
when it comes to threat actor galaxies

6102
03:32:24,560 --> 03:32:26,080
that is one of the most

6103
03:32:26,080 --> 03:32:27,760
actively updated ones by a lot of

6104
03:32:27,760 --> 03:32:29,200
different parties

6105
03:32:29,200 --> 03:32:32,080
and that sometimes several times per day

6106
03:32:32,080 --> 03:32:33,120
so it really depends

6107
03:32:33,120 --> 03:32:35,040
as for the custom galaxies that depends

6108
03:32:35,040 --> 03:32:36,880
on the synchronization

6109
03:32:36,880 --> 03:32:38,479
uh so if you're if you're part of a

6110
03:32:38,479 --> 03:32:40,479
community that is sharing information

6111
03:32:40,479 --> 03:32:41,040
about the

6112
03:32:41,040 --> 03:32:42,800
customs of threat actors and so on as

6113
03:32:42,800 --> 03:32:45,359
well then uh you will get information as

6114
03:32:45,359 --> 03:32:46,640
soon as it is published

6115
03:32:46,640 --> 03:32:51,760
so uh yeah that's basically it

6116
03:32:51,760 --> 03:32:54,960
we've already had that yeah yep

6117
03:32:54,960 --> 03:32:57,120
i think we don't have any more pending

6118
03:32:57,120 --> 03:32:59,760
questions oh there's one

6119
03:32:59,760 --> 03:33:04,640
mailing mr yeah okay uh

6120
03:33:04,640 --> 03:33:06,640
yeah the twitter account i think is is

6121
03:33:06,640 --> 03:33:08,479
the most important one we don't really

6122
03:33:08,479 --> 03:33:10,000
have a mailing list we used to have one

6123
03:33:10,000 --> 03:33:12,000
but we stopped doing that

6124
03:33:12,000 --> 03:33:13,600
so the best is really just to follow the

6125
03:33:13,600 --> 03:33:15,359
twitter account

6126
03:33:15,359 --> 03:33:18,319
yeah and for corporate people and so on

6127
03:33:18,319 --> 03:33:19,120
we have a

6128
03:33:19,120 --> 03:33:23,120
new professional services page where we

6129
03:33:23,120 --> 03:33:25,920
have some additional support for

6130
03:33:25,920 --> 03:33:27,600
organizations that are

6131
03:33:27,600 --> 03:33:29,920
not used to basically just have just

6132
03:33:29,920 --> 03:33:30,880
open source

6133
03:33:30,880 --> 03:33:33,760
and needs or more contractual

6134
03:33:33,760 --> 03:33:35,279
relationships

6135
03:33:35,279 --> 03:33:36,960
we have one called professional support

6136
03:33:36,960 --> 03:33:38,560
it's not something that we

6137
03:33:38,560 --> 03:33:40,479
we advertise a lot but sometimes it's

6138
03:33:40,479 --> 03:33:41,600
needed for

6139
03:33:41,600 --> 03:33:43,760
organizations and partnerships that they

6140
03:33:43,760 --> 03:33:46,160
need to be uh

6141
03:33:46,160 --> 03:33:47,410
in some way

6142
03:33:47,410 --> 03:33:50,489
[Music]

6143
03:33:55,600 --> 03:33:57,840
yeah so the professional services that

6144
03:33:57,840 --> 03:34:00,640
we provide is mainly on on issue ticket

6145
03:34:00,640 --> 03:34:04,319
and supplier to get some priorities

6146
03:34:04,319 --> 03:34:07,200
installation itself we are not really

6147
03:34:07,200 --> 03:34:09,200
doing that but

6148
03:34:09,200 --> 03:34:10,640
what we do for example for some

6149
03:34:10,640 --> 03:34:12,640
communities we do management and hosting

6150
03:34:12,640 --> 03:34:14,479
of misconceptions

6151
03:34:14,479 --> 03:34:16,800
so for example we operate various

6152
03:34:16,800 --> 03:34:19,600
communities and we find partnership

6153
03:34:19,600 --> 03:34:22,319
so we notice all the organization that

6154
03:34:22,319 --> 03:34:23,520
we are doing

6155
03:34:23,520 --> 03:34:27,439
but what we do is if we have a strong

6156
03:34:27,439 --> 03:34:28,080
intellect

6157
03:34:28,080 --> 03:34:30,800
of this kind of organization we can so

6158
03:34:30,800 --> 03:34:32,640
if you are interested just

6159
03:34:32,640 --> 03:34:37,840
drop us an email and we can have a look

6160
03:34:38,319 --> 03:34:43,840
yeah sure

6161
03:34:43,840 --> 03:34:45,680
and the twitter icon is pretty active

6162
03:34:45,680 --> 03:34:47,040
because we share

6163
03:34:47,040 --> 03:34:48,720
all information about release security

6164
03:34:48,720 --> 03:34:51,679
and abilities there

6165
03:34:53,760 --> 03:34:57,840
in the chat

6166
03:35:23,120 --> 03:35:24,640
and don't hesitate if you have a

6167
03:35:24,640 --> 03:35:26,160
research project idea

6168
03:35:26,160 --> 03:35:29,120
collaboration and so on we uh the

6169
03:35:29,120 --> 03:35:30,720
project is pretty large i mean

6170
03:35:30,720 --> 03:35:32,800
we have regular contributors the core

6171
03:35:32,800 --> 03:35:34,319
team is

6172
03:35:34,319 --> 03:35:35,680
the set of people that are always

6173
03:35:35,680 --> 03:35:38,000
willing to share and work with others so

6174
03:35:38,000 --> 03:35:40,800
don't hesitate and would be more eager

6175
03:35:40,800 --> 03:35:42,319
to support

6176
03:35:42,319 --> 03:35:47,359
a new use case or a specific usage of

6177
03:35:47,359 --> 03:35:49,040
regarding sharing communities if you are

6178
03:35:49,040 --> 03:35:51,120
building one and you want support or

6179
03:35:51,120 --> 03:35:52,960
you want to discuss with us and so on

6180
03:35:52,960 --> 03:35:55,200
don't hesitate to reach out

6181
03:35:55,200 --> 03:35:58,080
we are more eager to help on the

6182
03:35:58,080 --> 03:35:58,720
question of

6183
03:35:58,720 --> 03:36:00,560
building sharing communities and isaac

6184
03:36:00,560 --> 03:36:02,960
and so on

6185
03:36:04,840 --> 03:36:06,000
uh

6186
03:36:06,000 --> 03:36:09,120
uh yeah uh that that

6187
03:36:09,120 --> 03:36:10,720
should not be the case anymore so but

6188
03:36:10,720 --> 03:36:12,880
it's kind of tricky so right now the way

6189
03:36:12,880 --> 03:36:14,640
it works with sightings indeed uh

6190
03:36:14,640 --> 03:36:17,279
when you initially synchronize an event

6191
03:36:17,279 --> 03:36:18,960
uh the sightings carry along with an

6192
03:36:18,960 --> 03:36:19,680
event

6193
03:36:19,680 --> 03:36:21,279
and indeed if you just add follow-up

6194
03:36:21,279 --> 03:36:22,720
sightings they are not synchronized

6195
03:36:22,720 --> 03:36:24,560
directly so what happens is

6196
03:36:24,560 --> 03:36:26,479
every time an event is published the

6197
03:36:26,479 --> 03:36:28,960
sightings carry along with it

6198
03:36:28,960 --> 03:36:32,000
so it's indeed a little bit

6199
03:36:32,000 --> 03:36:34,319
messy in this sense that that whenever

6200
03:36:34,319 --> 03:36:35,600
there is an update to an event

6201
03:36:35,600 --> 03:36:37,200
all the new sightings carry over so you

6202
03:36:37,200 --> 03:36:38,880
would have to republish the event

6203
03:36:38,880 --> 03:36:40,640
to resynchronize the sightings for the

6204
03:36:40,640 --> 03:36:42,560
event this is something we're looking

6205
03:36:42,560 --> 03:36:42,960
into

6206
03:36:42,960 --> 03:36:45,040
decoupling completely from the event

6207
03:36:45,040 --> 03:36:46,319
synchronization process

6208
03:36:46,319 --> 03:36:48,960
and having a different trigger for it uh

6209
03:36:48,960 --> 03:36:50,880
and to really synchronize the sightings

6210
03:36:50,880 --> 03:36:51,279
uh

6211
03:36:51,279 --> 03:36:53,279
separately but right now the problem is

6212
03:36:53,279 --> 03:36:55,359
that sightings can get very numerous in

6213
03:36:55,359 --> 03:36:58,720
the negotiation phase would really put

6214
03:36:58,720 --> 03:37:03,120
an extra strain on the yeah

6215
03:37:03,120 --> 03:37:05,760
and that's linked to the external

6216
03:37:05,760 --> 03:37:07,520
sighting database connections too

6217
03:37:07,520 --> 03:37:09,200
so if you want to have a specific site

6218
03:37:09,200 --> 03:37:10,720
in there

6219
03:37:10,720 --> 03:37:14,399
that's that's another another way to do

6220
03:37:14,840 --> 03:37:17,840
it

6221
03:37:22,000 --> 03:37:24,880
any other questions

6222
03:37:25,520 --> 03:37:27,920
why not we can what we can we can we can

6223
03:37:27,920 --> 03:37:31,200
close the session for today

6224
03:37:34,560 --> 03:37:36,560
oh we didn't talk about the talk we

6225
03:37:36,560 --> 03:37:38,080
didn't talk about that

6226
03:37:38,080 --> 03:37:40,319
yes

6227
03:37:41,840 --> 03:37:43,680
okay that's okay we can do a quick one

6228
03:37:43,680 --> 03:37:45,920
before before uh

6229
03:37:45,920 --> 03:37:49,600
so base in in this ability to add

6230
03:37:49,600 --> 03:37:52,319
widgets uh or maybe unless you want to

6231
03:37:52,319 --> 03:37:53,359
talk about it

6232
03:37:53,359 --> 03:37:55,279
yeah so so basically we have two

6233
03:37:55,279 --> 03:37:57,200
dashboard systems one that is built into

6234
03:37:57,200 --> 03:37:58,640
miss so that is the one that alex is

6235
03:37:58,640 --> 03:37:59,680
showing

6236
03:37:59,680 --> 03:38:01,040
with this one you can you can use a

6237
03:38:01,040 --> 03:38:02,800
bunch of different

6238
03:38:02,800 --> 03:38:05,840
widgets that you can configure for each

6239
03:38:05,840 --> 03:38:07,279
individual user

6240
03:38:07,279 --> 03:38:10,560
and they're using the local queries on

6241
03:38:10,560 --> 03:38:13,279
the instance including all the acl

6242
03:38:13,279 --> 03:38:15,200
being included and so on so it's pretty

6243
03:38:15,200 --> 03:38:16,399
safe to use on across

6244
03:38:16,399 --> 03:38:19,200
instance there is a question and is

6245
03:38:19,200 --> 03:38:19,600
there

6246
03:38:19,600 --> 03:38:21,120
another way to design dashboard apart

6247
03:38:21,120 --> 03:38:23,760
from this dashboard where we can export

6248
03:38:23,760 --> 03:38:26,080
dashboard elements to other web portals

6249
03:38:26,080 --> 03:38:27,680
so this is indeed not something we can

6250
03:38:27,680 --> 03:38:29,120
do but that is something we should be

6251
03:38:29,120 --> 03:38:29,840
able to do

6252
03:38:29,840 --> 03:38:33,120
ah that's a good one okay i'll think

6253
03:38:33,120 --> 03:38:33,920
about it and

6254
03:38:33,920 --> 03:38:35,279
and we'll do something with that so we

6255
03:38:35,279 --> 03:38:36,640
can do that because you cannot

6256
03:38:36,640 --> 03:38:38,239
individually request just the output

6257
03:38:38,239 --> 03:38:41,279
from a dashboard widget but it's safe

6258
03:38:41,279 --> 03:38:43,040
so you you want to finally include the

6259
03:38:43,040 --> 03:38:44,640
yeah yeah yeah that makes sense

6260
03:38:44,640 --> 03:38:46,479
okay and that's that's a very good one

6261
03:38:46,479 --> 03:38:47,920
an open issue about that

6262
03:38:47,920 --> 03:38:49,520
because that's something we should be

6263
03:38:49,520 --> 03:38:51,120
able to do i mean

6264
03:38:51,120 --> 03:38:52,960
we already have the query we just don't

6265
03:38:52,960 --> 03:38:55,199
describe how to fetch that

6266
03:38:55,199 --> 03:38:58,000
because what this system does as well is

6267
03:38:58,000 --> 03:38:59,359
it basically it does

6268
03:38:59,359 --> 03:39:01,439
an ajax query and fetches the contents

6269
03:39:01,439 --> 03:39:02,399
of the

6270
03:39:02,399 --> 03:39:04,479
uh widget and it just places it on the

6271
03:39:04,479 --> 03:39:06,239
page we just need to expose that query

6272
03:39:06,239 --> 03:39:08,399
so that you can put on other web portals

6273
03:39:08,399 --> 03:39:09,920
yeah and you can just use the api key

6274
03:39:09,920 --> 03:39:12,080
and then you can get it yeah

6275
03:39:12,080 --> 03:39:13,840
that's a good point that's a very good

6276
03:39:13,840 --> 03:39:15,439
point yeah

6277
03:39:15,439 --> 03:39:16,800
i don't know why we didn't think of that

6278
03:39:16,800 --> 03:39:18,640
before

6279
03:39:18,640 --> 03:39:21,120
that's silly and the miss dashboard

6280
03:39:21,120 --> 03:39:23,520
itself is an external application so

6281
03:39:23,520 --> 03:39:25,760
it's the this may be a confusion about

6282
03:39:25,760 --> 03:39:26,640
that so this

6283
03:39:26,640 --> 03:39:29,279
building dashboard with widgets in mist

6284
03:39:29,279 --> 03:39:30,080
and you have a miss

6285
03:39:30,080 --> 03:39:31,520
dashboard which is an external

6286
03:39:31,520 --> 03:39:33,120
applications where it's a kind of proof

6287
03:39:33,120 --> 03:39:34,560
of concept development

6288
03:39:34,560 --> 03:39:37,040
based on the zero mq feeds to show what

6289
03:39:37,040 --> 03:39:39,120
you can do automatically with the field

6290
03:39:39,120 --> 03:39:41,040
with two separate things it's nothing to

6291
03:39:41,040 --> 03:39:42,399
do with which is

6292
03:39:42,399 --> 03:39:45,920
each other and

6293
03:39:45,920 --> 03:39:48,080
this dashboard is developing python as a

6294
03:39:48,080 --> 03:39:50,000
standalone application this one is

6295
03:39:50,000 --> 03:39:54,160
really part of the core of

6296
03:40:02,640 --> 03:40:06,880
openness about it okay good

6297
03:40:07,040 --> 03:40:09,680
that's a good one

6298
03:40:10,880 --> 03:40:14,000
okay um thank you thank you very much

6299
03:40:14,000 --> 03:40:16,160
it was great to have a lot of people

6300
03:40:16,160 --> 03:40:18,160
today for the second session of

6301
03:40:18,160 --> 03:40:22,080
the workshop uh so again

6302
03:40:22,080 --> 03:40:24,160
it's nice to see a lot of people we had

6303
03:40:24,160 --> 03:40:25,199
like 57

6304
03:40:25,199 --> 03:40:28,160
questions today and and so on we opened

6305
03:40:28,160 --> 03:40:30,720
some issue too so it's usually a good a

6306
03:40:30,720 --> 03:40:32,239
good sign

6307
03:40:32,239 --> 03:40:34,000
and for us really helping the

6308
03:40:34,000 --> 03:40:35,760
development of me so

6309
03:40:35,760 --> 03:40:37,680
thank you and and thanks a lot for your

6310
03:40:37,680 --> 03:40:39,520
collaboration pretty it's really great

6311
03:40:39,520 --> 03:40:43,040
thank you very much take care

6312
03:40:44,160 --> 03:40:55,279
thanks all see you bye
