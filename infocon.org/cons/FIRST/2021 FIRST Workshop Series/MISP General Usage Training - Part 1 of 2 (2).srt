of one hour where we do amazons together

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,559
um for the logistic aspect um

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,520
in the chat room we will share with you

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:55,840
uh

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,520
all the details how to access the mist

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,520
instance so during the sessions in the

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,399
workshop

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,239
you can connect to a dedicated michelin

30
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,840
stand that we set up for you

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,840
and this one will be used for all the

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,680
end and zones that we will

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,080
we do as i just mentioned we have a

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,240
small short break of 15 minutes

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,159
and then we will continue in the end

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,680
zone and so on

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,960
depending of how far we are today uh

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,880
we will maybe talk about the community

39
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,960
building aspect but this is a topic for

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,720
tomorrow obviously

41
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,240
but if we have some time remaining we

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,640
might uh talk about this and then we

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,280
have a

44
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,920
q a sessions uh to discuss about the

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,280
different topic and so on

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,360
so don't hesitate to to put your

47
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,439
question into and to zoom

48
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,439
uh directly and we will try to answer

49
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,799
her life

50
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,320
all those questions that you are asking

51
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,600
during uh during this session

52
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,479
so first of all welcome all as well from

53
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,240
me so i'm on rashi claudia i'm

54
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,520
also working at circle working on miss

55
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,799
um to just kick things off um i think

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,280
it's a good

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,719
good moment to start a little bit about

58
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,079
the history of how this whole thing

59
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,079
started how myst came about

60
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,880
so just a quick introduction of where we

61
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,840
came from and where where we are

62
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,520
nowadays uh initially this whole thing

63
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,399
for us with miss

64
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,520
started as part of a of a series of

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,959
incidents that we had in

66
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,360
back in 2012 between national and

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,760
military certs at the time

68
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,480
where we were basically investigating um

69
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,520
attacks

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,800
that were hitting several of the

71
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,120
institutions at the at the time

72
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,319
and one of the interesting things that

73
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,400
we found was that even though we had

74
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,760
something called the malware analysis

75
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,519
working group which was this which is a

76
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,120
group that was regularly meeting and

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,360
discussing ongoing incidents

78
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,680
we still had a massive gap in between

79
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,720
those meetings

80
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,080
where everyone was working in their own

81
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,319
silo on basically the same attack and

82
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,920
and doing reverse engineering of the

83
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,760
same attacks without

84
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,000
having the ways the means or the

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,120
processes

86
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
to directly share with our peers so we

87
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,040
ended up with a lot of duplication of

88
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,920
work which ended

89
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,760
which was obviously frustrating from uh

90
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,200
for many of us

91
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,440
so christoph and the bus at the time he

92
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,599
was working at the belgian

93
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,319
ministry of defense um in his free time

94
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,400
wrote a platform called side of sick

95
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,319
that later on ended up becoming miss so

96
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,519
the initial idea was

97
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,280
really for reverse engineers to share

98
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,800
the output of their work directly with

99
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,440
their peers

100
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,720
in a hosted platform and since then

101
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,159
obviously miss has evolved and changed

102
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,159
the scope of what we were nowadays doing

103
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,840
with misp and what sort of information

104
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,799
we're sharing

105
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,640
but it all started with this and since

106
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,159
then it has been an ongoing effort

107
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,879
basically by

108
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,200
a large community of different

109
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
requirements and different needs

110
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,360
and that has been building both the

111
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
ideas that go into misp as well as the

112
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,159
software itself

113
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,839
next time please

114
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,200
yeah so what is the background and why

115
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,920
we are doing

116
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,840
we missed it uh i think like on rash

117
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,080
mentioned it started from a with a kind

118
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,640
of

119
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,040
verisco project for a small set of

120
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,480
cesium

121
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,599
circulates is nowadays

122
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,959
the search for the private sector the

123
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,360
community modernities in luxembourg

124
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,959
and we basically deal with the

125
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,200
development of mix not only for our use

126
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,159
case but for many

127
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,360
different users so we are called as

128
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,320
a third we basically operate the

129
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,440
development and we operate

130
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,479
differentiating communities

131
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,639
so a little bit about our involvement

132
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:26,960
and

133
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,479
why we're doing this in the first place

134
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,080
so we as circle we're funded by the

135
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,560
ministry of economy to basically build

136
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,680
security for the private sector uh and a

137
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,600
lot of what we do involves uh open

138
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,199
source software development so we're

139
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:39,840
basically

140
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,160
the funding that we get for the uh for

141
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,080
activities also cover our development

142
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,199
forms

143
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,919
we're also uh besides just building the

144
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,360
tools like santa's our dimension we're

145
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,160
also

146
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,479
basically involved in a lot of sharing

147
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,919
activities as well as our day-to-day

148
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,840
operations we're users of the

149
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,400
tool primarily as well we basically host

150
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,479
a bunch of different communities for the

151
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,720
uh national c-certs for the

152
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,440
luxembourgish private sector community

153
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,919
for law enforcement uh organizations

154
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,680
financial institutions and so on and so

155
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,960
forth

156
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,320
so so we're kind of uh

157
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,240
in the game on both sides so to say that

158
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
both as a

159
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,120
producer and as a consumer also and the

160
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,000
project was

161
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,080
co-financed by the euro european union

162
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,759
under the sev project

163
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,120
uh so this is also one of the sources of

164
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,400
the income that we got basically to

165
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,120
build the tool and as a first member you

166
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,560
have access to a misping stamp that is

167
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,080
operated

168
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,479
maintained by the first and circle that

169
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,000
you can get access to

170
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
so you just need to to use your

171
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,520
traditional credential or

172
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,680
access at first and you get access to

173
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360
this instance with information

174
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,600
that you can use and so on we will talk

175
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,440
about that later on

176
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,160
so me the main question and i think it's

177
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
coming from this story uh

178
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,080
as andresh mentioned from the early days

179
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,600
miss was

180
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,759
focusing from a very specific aspect

181
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,840
which was malware reversing and so on

182
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,120
nowadays it's are sharing platforms we

183
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,800
are basically sharing any kind of

184
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,039
intelligence through uh through miss

185
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,039
um because we had an evolution of the

186
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,479
time for the different things so

187
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,400
and our main goals and that's very

188
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,880
important for us it's an open source

189
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,440
software so that means miss will always

190
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,120
remain an open source project we even

191
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,520
take

192
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,000
some decisions within the project to

193
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,880
keep it as

194
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,120
open source and that's that's really a

195
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,639
key for us so it's really uh

196
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,720
something that you can download yourself

197
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,800
from on your infrastructure and so on

198
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,039
you can really have the full control on

199
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,240
the software stack

200
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,639
when you are using lisp and one of the

201
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,000
goals of the software itself is to

202
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,039
collect information

203
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,240
from other partners from in the analyst

204
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
from automatic tools from different

205
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,280
fields and so on

206
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,800
that was really one of the initial goal

207
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,199
of myth is like being able to collect

208
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,680
to get all this information into one uh

209
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,360
one place

210
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,039
and then afterwards what you can do with

211
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,560
it is to normalize

212
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,720
correlate this information extend the

213
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,840
information and reach

214
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,560
information with more information and

215
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,199
then

216
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,880
really benefit from the sharing aspect

217
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,800
of mix and you can allow

218
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,120
teams and community to cover collaborate

219
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,840
and we have

220
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,479
seen miss for example use not only

221
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,319
within different organizations but even

222
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,160
within a single organization you can for

223
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,759
example run multiple myths

224
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,240
to collaborate directly on different

225
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,120
investigations

226
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,080
impedance and casey and obviously when

227
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,520
you have all this information and all

228
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,280
these analysis performance to miss

229
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,759
you are ready to use this information to

230
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,639
for example

231
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,960
feed your automatic protective tools

232
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,840
like intrusion detection systems

233
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,000
firewalls whatever and to feed

234
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,280
automatically those

235
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,599
information to basically make protective

236
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,800
measures

237
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,319
in your in your environment

238
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,479
so start from the starting point that we

239
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,840
already mentioned basically how we

240
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,680
started out with ms

241
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,639
let's have a quick look at how uh the

242
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,800
user user base of mr evolved in terms of

243
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,400
the different types of stakeholders

244
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,000
within our own organizations and other

245
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,120
organizations

246
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,560
the reason for that is obviously that

247
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,319
this drives the development process as

248
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:10,800
well

249
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
so the way miss grows over time really

250
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,400
depends the type of users that are using

251
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,800
the

252
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,479
type of users that are requesting new

253
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,319
features or that are providing pull

254
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,160
requests on the project and providing

255
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,720
code

256
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,639
for the project so i said before

257
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,759
initially

258
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,160
the scope of miss was very limited it

259
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,759
was basically just the output of malware

260
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,360
reversers which meant

261
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,199
raw indicators that we were extracting

262
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,479
during the process and that we're

263
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,559
sharing directly

264
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,640
with our partners this meant very little

265
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,080
analysis was done on each of these

266
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,519
individual indicators there was very

267
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,599
little information in terms of

268
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,440
of why those data points are relevant in

269
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,200
the long term how they are meant to be

270
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,760
used

271
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,360
from detection perspective they were

272
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,519
really just the raw output

273
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,480
from the analysis process or the

274
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,000
reversing process

275
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,080
now one of the side effects of this when

276
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,519
you start building a collection within

277
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,440
your organization of this information

278
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,360
the security analysts are feeding your

279
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,880
various protective tools become

280
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,320
interested in that data set

281
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,839
because obviously whatever is targeting

282
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,000
your organization or your direct peers

283
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,160
are probably the most relevant piece of

284
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,360
information that you can use for

285
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,040
detection

286
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,160
so one of the first steps that we that

287
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,959
we opened

288
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,040
up to was basically involving our own

289
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,480
security analysis our

290
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,279
own organizations so they can hook their

291
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,320
the output of

292
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,360
of the reverse engineering team

293
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,080
up to their seams to their ids's to

294
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,360
their firewalls

295
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
and to feed this data directly into

296
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,440
their protective measures

297
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,720
now one of the interesting things when

298
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
you start doing that though is that you

299
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,800
generate a new type of output which is

300
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,560
timeliness for the data freshness for

301
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
the data as well as feedback on how

302
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,839
useful the data was

303
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,839
so we're very often when you're

304
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,240
extracting information for uh

305
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,040
by sandboxing for example a lot of the

306
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,360
data generated will be nice in the end

307
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,680
and this noise will generate false

308
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,760
positive alerts for example in your id

309
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,160
in your detection tools now feeding this

310
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,320
information back

311
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,560
to data gave it a whole new type of

312
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,519
value

313
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,560
we had freshness so if an older

314
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,160
indicator was reused

315
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
over time we saw that that is still

316
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,440
something that is actively to be

317
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,560
monitored

318
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,160
and if we saw that something turned out

319
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,839
to be a cleaned up host

320
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,200
in the meanwhile or something was a

321
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,440
false positive from the get-go

322
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,200
we could feed that information back as

323
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,880
well so

324
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,399
suddenly once you have timeliness as

325
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,760
well as the the raw data itself

326
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
you uh you get the intelligence and

327
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,279
lists interested that are tracking the

328
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,399
movements and the

329
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,519
changes of how attackers operate

330
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,000
uh over time so that means that usually

331
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,640
back then

332
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,360
especially in 2012 in most of our

333
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,200
organizations the people that are doing

334
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,560
intelligence and the people that were

335
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,560
doing operations and security for the

336
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,240
operations were usually working in their

337
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,440
own silos

338
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,680
so while there was obviously interaction

339
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,040
between the teams it was not as

340
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,959
ingrained to work together

341
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,920
between those type of rules but this

342
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,600
changed over time and one of the changes

343
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,000
that

344
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
that we saw happened was that the output

345
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,079
of what the security analysts

346
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,240
and the reversers and the analysts were

347
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,160
outputting basically from the operation

348
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,880
side

349
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,480
became more and more interesting for the

350
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,399
intelligence analysts that meant that

351
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,839
if they were tracking a certain threat

352
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,920
actor and they could attribute certain

353
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,600
actions that they were seen in the

354
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
network of the organization

355
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,519
to the certain threat actor they could

356
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,959
monitor for example how

357
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,279
the given actuary was changing how fast

358
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,880
they were changing infrastructure

359
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,079
whether they were switching up their

360
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,000
methodology and this

361
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,079
gave them a lot of idea of useful data

362
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,519
of improving their libraries of the

363
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,200
threat actors that they were tracking

364
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,800
so suddenly we got this group interest

365
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,920
as well and they were obviously

366
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,839
producing data as well so nowadays if

367
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:44,880
you look at misp

368
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,279
going from a raw indicator uh sharing

369
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,200
platform that mis was initially

370
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,399
nowadays you have a lot of the high

371
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,160
level threat intel information included

372
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,760
with the data as well so you will see

373
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,880
threat reports

374
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,720
you will see interconnected information

375
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
about uh

376
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,839
threat actors modus operandi uh

377
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,399
infrastructure impact and so on so all

378
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,079
these extra layers of information that

379
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,360
we're missing initially

380
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,720
so this was the biggest change that we

381
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,000
had over time within our own

382
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,440
organizations but

383
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,920
obviously it's a c-cert that has

384
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,519
different constituencies

385
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,200
we're also interacting with the security

386
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,800
teams of other organizations and one of

387
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,720
the things we noticed early on was

388
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,320
there's a lot of the issues that other

389
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,160
types of organizations had internally

390
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,600
with information sharing are very

391
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,880
similar to ours

392
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,800
so initially the first use case that we

393
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,959
got that was different and from our

394
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,800
normal security use case

395
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,720
was basically the various financial

396
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,399
organizations reaching out to us saying

397
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,920
that their fraud teams were

398
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,760
running into similar sort of issues with

399
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,600
sharing between their teams

400
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,760
sharing with other partner teams

401
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,839
information about mule accounts and

402
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,320
about other fraud related information

403
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,519
so they reached out to us and they

404
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,680
basically their security teams reached

405
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,480
out to us and said

406
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,200
can't we just try to help them uh also

407
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,639
to share that sort of information

408
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,000
through misdirectly i mean we already

409
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,760
had the tooling in place

410
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,200
it was just a question of changing the

411
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
data model so

412
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,120
we we started doing that for uh together

413
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,639
with the financial sector initially

414
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,480
where we expanded the data model of miss

415
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,000
when we allowed for modeling of new

416
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,519
custom data types

417
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,920
and it's even surprising to us at the

418
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,680
time turned into a success

419
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,320
very rapidly so nowadays we're involved

420
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,600
with quite a few different types of

421
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,959
organizations out there

422
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,519
replicating the same scenario where for

423
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,880
example law enforcement where we

424
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,320
initially had

425
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
mostly contact with their security teams

426
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,079
and helping them build data sets for

427
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:32,720
their

428
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,399
for bootstrapping their forensic

429
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,240
investigations nowadays we have all

430
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,480
sorts of information sharing involving

431
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,959
uh for example uh seized good

432
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,639
information sharing from

433
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,279
border control agencies uh law

434
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,880
enforcement agencies uh

435
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,800
sharing information about passenger

436
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,120
information so a lot of the type of data

437
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,360
sharing that was very unusual for us as

438
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
a sister initially

439
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,079
now once you get all this data in a

440
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:58,880
system and you

441
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,040
started building a data set from your

442
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,480
community

443
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,399
you start to see trends in the data set

444
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,079
and this is what gets

445
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,839
for example our risk analysis team

446
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,760
interested in it the moment that you're

447
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,440
seeing how attackers are changing their

448
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,639
trends over time

449
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,199
you can better advise your uh your

450
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,360
constituency your customers and so on

451
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,720
about the different phase

452
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,959
risks that they might be facing and the

453
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,160
different risks that they should be

454
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,279
preparing for

455
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,880
and preparing the organizations for

456
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,959
based on what the same sector is facing

457
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,519
perhaps in the same geographic location

458
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,360
so suddenly you get a lot of knowledge

459
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,120
out of the collected data as long as

460
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
data is well contextualized and i think

461
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,720
this will be one of the main topics that

462
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,079
we're going to be talking about quite a

463
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,680
bit today and tomorrow

464
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,519
is contextualizing the information and

465
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,600
making the information actually usable

466
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
and turning data really into knowledge

467
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,639
yeah so like andrash mentioned

468
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,040
we have a pretty large set of different

469
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,240
communities using mist

470
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,000
and over the time it became i think more

471
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,160
complicated to handle all those requests

472
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,760
from different organizations

473
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,120
um so we came with a model of governance

474
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,000
even if it's a very lightweight one we

475
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
decided to have this kind of models to

476
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,839
still benefit from the open source

477
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,680
community model and then

478
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,199
bring all the experience from a

479
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,279
different community into systems where

480
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,199
it allows us to develop and extend the

481
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,720
software so we decided to

482
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,959
create this kind of models where we

483
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,240
basically

484
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,880
take care of all the features and

485
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,320
requests that we receive from different

486
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,680
organizations

487
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,399
so we use this kind of priority list of

488
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,600
different features

489
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,279
and we get we get that feedback from

490
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,720
different

491
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,639
one of the abusive one i would say is

492
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,880
github so we get the feed from

493
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,480
the different issue that we receive from

494
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,399
github i mean on the if you look at on

495
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,639
github you'll see that we have a

496
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,320
significant number of issues and those

497
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
issue are usually for us a way to track

498
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,800
down

499
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,639
all the different requests of features

500
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,880
in myth and that's one way to get it

501
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,120
another way and this one is a quite

502
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,639
common one one

503
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,399
is basically a training or session like

504
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,040
this where people are providing feedback

505
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,800
bug reports future requests and so on

506
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,040
directly during the training and for us

507
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,880
uh i think really practical and we can

508
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,959
get all this information needed for us

509
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,040
to improve the software another thing

510
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,000
that we do and

511
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,759
that's maybe for the audience some

512
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,839
people are interested in that one

513
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,040
we know that there are plenty of

514
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,560
different misuse of groups that we don't

515
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,399
control and that we don't manage that's

516
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,320
great we have for example isaac isao

517
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,680
doing really those kind of things where

518
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,360
you have those kind of user groups

519
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,839
and what we do we participate to on a

520
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,600
regular basis to one of those groups for

521
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,279
example on a quarterly basis on a yearly

522
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,000
basis

523
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,240
and we do a collection of requirements

524
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,759
from those different groups

525
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,240
during during one session and that's

526
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,959
really

527
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,720
i think useful for us because it's a way

528
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,800
to to gather information so for example

529
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,720
on rash mentioned those

530
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,079
financial groups where people are

531
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,519
sharing information about bank account

532
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,560
detail and so on

533
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,480
and that's where we basically gather all

534
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,920
those requirements

535
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,279
so if you are setting up a group

536
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,040
somewhere in u.s or

537
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,279
in the world about sharing information

538
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,319
and so on and you want to

539
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,000
invite us at some point in time it's a

540
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,760
way for us to gather those kind of

541
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,959
requirements

542
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,160
we do a summit which is a yearly event

543
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,760
usually it was physical but nowadays

544
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,599
it's virtual trainings

545
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,000
so it's basically every user or

546
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,919
organizations using mispresenting what

547
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,199
they are doing

548
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,959
it's a way for us to to see the

549
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,559
interactions and see what

550
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,480
can be improved in myths and see or

551
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
dynamic in the community behind

552
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,760
and then we have a kind of twenty

553
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,840
percent project around in myth

554
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,200
where we design new functionalities and

555
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,000
we test

556
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,559
them out for example one of those is the

557
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,919
detailing of indicators

558
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,200
which was a request from different

559
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,400
organizations but it was kind of

560
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,919
difficult to design

561
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,919
and with this kind of models where we we

562
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,240
designed first as a kind of prototype

563
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,480
multiple iterations uh we did a multiple

564
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,559
research paper on that and then finally

565
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,000
this become part of the core software

566
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,919
we will show that later on but so we

567
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,679
have a lightweight governance model

568
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,679
but really the goal is to to gather as

569
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,840
much feedback from the user so don't

570
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,280
hesitate if you have any

571
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,600
bug reports idea and so on either open

572
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,320
issue

573
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,360
get in touch with us um we are more than

574
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,919
we

575
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,280
you are more than welcome to basically

576
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,399
share such kind of information

577
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,320
yeah now addressing the elephant in the

578
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,720
room

579
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,160
when you bring so many different

580
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
organizations together and build a large

581
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,760
community of sharing with different

582
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,200
needs and requirements

583
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,559
you're obviously going to have to run

584
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,200
into conflicting requirements as well

585
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,720
so one of the most obvious ones that

586
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,240
that we're dealing with very often with

587
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,640
information sharing and something that

588
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,720
that we have we're working on tackling

589
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,840
basically

590
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,080
since we started with miss is dealing

591
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,600
with a different requirement of

592
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,280
of what you count as valuable

593
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
information depending on your use case

594
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,520
so this is

595
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,400
different also within the different

596
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,600
analysts different

597
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,360
roles within the same organization as

598
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,080
well so for example for us as a c-cert

599
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,039
in general

600
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,720
uh detection is the most important

601
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,240
matter so we're interested

602
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,640
uh in in using indicators to detect if

603
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
our constituency

604
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,880
is affected by something that the

605
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,000
information is being

606
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,880
shared about or whether uh any of the

607
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,160
the infrastructure that we're

608
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,200
responsible for is uh is infected on the

609
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,840
other hand

610
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,919
if you're if you're talking to an isp

611
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,640
one of the large

612
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,640
requirements from an isp basically will

613
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,720
be able to protect their users

614
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,039
from potential harm so that means that

615
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,080
there are

616
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,000
if there are any urls websites and so on

617
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,480
that

618
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,880
they should block for their users they

619
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,480
need to be able to generate a block list

620
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,679
out of the data

621
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,440
that is considered to be malicious

622
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,600
enough now if you compare these two use

623
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,360
cases with each other detection versus

624
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,240
blocking

625
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,400
you will immediately see that the effect

626
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,360
of

627
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,200
of having a false positive in the data

628
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,360
set or data that is no longer fresh

629
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,160
has a completely different impact sure

630
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,120
for us when

631
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,960
that are mostly in the detection game

632
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,720
it's annoying we get a false positive

633
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,400
alert it has to be handled

634
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
and it takes time and effort it also

635
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,760
introduces something called alert

636
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,200
fatigue that i'm sure many of you are

637
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,320
familiar with

638
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,440
if you're getting a lot of false

639
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,080
positive alerts you're more likely to

640
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,120
ignore the

641
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,679
next alert that you get but besides that

642
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,799
it has no real

643
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,120
operational impact on us on the other

644
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,880
hand for an isp that ends up blocking

645
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,880
something that is uh

646
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
potentially a false positive might have

647
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,400
a catastrophic impact

648
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,840
imagine if someone accidentally for

649
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,600
example shares

650
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,280
facebook.com as an indicator that might

651
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,760
basically cause a riot with their uh

652
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,280
with their users or it might stop one

653
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,120
but it's a different story

654
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,520
but with that in mind you see that these

655
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,480
two use cases are already conflicting

656
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,679
now if you also take the perspective of

657
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,360
intelligence unless that are tracking

658
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,400
strategy movements into account that's

659
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:52,799
an

660
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,880
even more lacks use case where you care

661
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,400
uh where you care about

662
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,159
uh whether something is a fresh

663
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,080
indicator still or not

664
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,159
even less than the other two groups the

665
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,440
reason for that is you're interested in

666
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,880
the historical movements

667
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,120
of a threat actor for example so even if

668
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,240
something is no longer

669
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,440
an indicator because and an infected

670
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,039
website was cleaned up

671
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,960
since the time when the indicator was

672
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,039
shared they still want to see

673
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,880
how long for example a threat actor was

674
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,559
using that infrastructure

675
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,080
how quickly they changed to something

676
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,120
else and what methods they used

677
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,520
back when they were exploiting it so if

678
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,240
you bring

679
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,480
these different requirements on board on

680
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,840
the same

681
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,200
platform is difficult and there are some

682
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,960
things that we can do to alleviate these

683
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
issues for example what we do with

684
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,720
mispis

685
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,799
we have a system called warning list

686
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,480
system that allows us to filter out

687
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
obvious false positives

688
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,640
so we maintain these lists of most

689
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,799
most common websites empty hash lists

690
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,720
public dns resolvers and all these

691
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,320
typical things that end up in

692
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,559
the sets while doing automatic

693
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,400
extraction for example

694
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
that end up being false positives but

695
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,080
with that said this is just one part of

696
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,720
the story

697
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,480
uh so if you're looking at the different

698
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,080
use cases up there that doesn't solve

699
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,880
our issue of

700
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,000
of having different requirements from

701
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,600
from the data set based on what you do

702
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,559
with it

703
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,559
and this is where contextualization

704
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,320
becomes more important again

705
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,159
if we can supply the information

706
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,000
together with the data why this data is

707
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,440
relevant and what context you're

708
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,880
supposed to be using it

709
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,640
then the consumers of the data can make

710
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,480
those decisions for themselves based on

711
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,440
whatever they want to use

712
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,280
the data for in any of those different

713
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,640
use cases

714
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,520
so so one of our main efforts with misp

715
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,720
has been

716
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,400
to be able to provide these different

717
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,000
structures together with the data and to

718
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,520
be able to label data well enough

719
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,880
back to you yeah so and that's

720
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,960
i think an important regarding the

721
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,720
different kind of use cases and so on

722
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
and we try to try to

723
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,360
to support those different use cases and

724
00:22:59,360 --> 00:22:59,760
that's

725
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,679
sometimes challenging for us but luckily

726
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,679
we are at the same time

727
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,320
part of various community so we can see

728
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,840
the different use cases especially

729
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,280
regarding the ending of

730
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,480
of false positive which is a

731
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,880
an ongoing challenge but uh we will show

732
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,559
you or to handle that

733
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,840
and at the same time we basically

734
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,000
operate those different communities um

735
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,080
so for example we operate a pretty large

736
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,159
one for the private sector

737
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,799
um where we have a lot a lot of

738
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,559
organizations more than

739
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,880
1200 organizations are basically uh

740
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,159
connected there um

741
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,440
it's pretty large and we see an active

742
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,799
community sharing information and then

743
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,400
you have plenty of different communities

744
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
some that we don't know even about

745
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,840
because you can even run your own

746
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,279
private communities without telling

747
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,559
anyone that's fine

748
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,880
that's part of the system but if you you

749
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,760
want to have

750
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,200
different kind of communities you can

751
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,840
connect those uh

752
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,240
automatically then you have i would say

753
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,679
different kind of model you have those

754
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,799
kind of of

755
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,799
fully island mode communities to kind of

756
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,480
trust in groups so for example for the

757
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,679
intelligence community

758
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,760
it's very common for them to run miss

759
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,520
spin and island mode

760
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,760
so having a gap system and so on

761
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
sometimes they are partially connected

762
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,919
with third parties to share partial

763
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,600
information so for example we know some

764
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,400
organizations

765
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,200
or for example border controls or

766
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,640
customs

767
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,080
are using myths but they still need to

768
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,919
share some some small information and

769
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:22,320
that

770
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
partially connected system risk freely

771
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,159
and supports those kind of models

772
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,000
and then you have community that are

773
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,679
more broad and more large

774
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,360
for example in the financial sector and

775
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,279
i think the secret to luxembourg has

776
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,240
some banks

777
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,880
uh we we are involved in various sharing

778
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,600
communities

779
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,480
at european level and worldwide level um

780
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,520
where for example we

781
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,760
we know some isaac that are dedicated to

782
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,600
the financial sector are using it as a

783
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,200
sharing mechanism you have some

784
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,039
organizations that are really

785
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,279
dedicated to a payment processing system

786
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,480
that are using this to share

787
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,520
automatically

788
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,640
information and so on or analysis uh one

789
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,520
of

790
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,279
the i was a pretty large community too

791
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,520
with the military

792
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,960
organization in international

793
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,360
organizations first for example

794
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,720
you have a lot of first number using

795
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,640
myths for sharing their information

796
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,159
but there are plenty of networks

797
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,760
national governmental networks

798
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,840
a military one intelligence one or even

799
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,279
nato for example are using

800
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,679
using myths so maybe some of you are

801
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,600
eligible to access those ones so we have

802
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,720
on the mixed

803
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,400
interface a way to connect to those

804
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,320
community and you can reach out to the

805
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,240
different community by asking an access

806
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,200
for example

807
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,960
then you have very specific communities

808
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,320
that are set up by

809
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,720
security vendors it's not uncommon to

810
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,000
see for example a security vendor

811
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,760
services their own miss

812
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,360
we have seen for example some

813
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,120
traditional agents vendors running a

814
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,320
dedicated miss

815
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,799
or even some operators of specific cloud

816
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,480
services running as municipal instance

817
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,400
to share information amongst

818
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,360
their different customers then you have

819
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,320
communities that are

820
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,799
i would say very specific on the topic

821
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,039
for example you have

822
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,080
about sick information uh forced news

823
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,039
and stuff like that you have

824
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,279
communities doing that uh for example we

825
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,120
cooperate one called the commitment in

826
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,720
mist which is really targeting

827
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,919
um covet 19 as a topic and then you have

828
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,840
10 different subtopics like cybex

829
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,720
security

830
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,400
health related topics and forms so you

831
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,919
can see that this can be really used on

832
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,679
different model of communities

833
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,440
you can bridge those communities you can

834
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
interconnect those with together

835
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,360
you can keep it for yourself so it's

836
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,760
really a matter of models um

837
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,840
worldwide there are i would say a lot of

838
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,760
communities that we are not aware of

839
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,200
uh but we as fiscal uh operates

840
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,600
around 20 communities nowadays that you

841
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,120
can basically get access

842
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,840
and that's just sharing the chat uh the

843
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
access to the commit 19

844
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,440
list and if you want to get access to

845
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,679
that one you can connect on the

846
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,320
on the main page and self-register and

847
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,200
you can request

848
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,520
access to that community so you see that

849
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,799
misp has

850
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,039
different groups different communities

851
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,360
and it's up to you at the end to decide

852
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,640
which kind of community you want to

853
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,880
visit

854
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,960
so a little bit besides all the

855
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,799
technical things that we talked about

856
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,480
that we do with miss spend when that we

857
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,840
try to solve it

858
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,919
in terms of sharing there are obviously

859
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,279
going to be other hurdles that you have

860
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,720
to overcome whenever it comes to

861
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,159
information sharing

862
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,000
one of the the toughest things to

863
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,679
overcome and this is where no two can

864
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,880
really help you

865
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,080
is to get enough trust in a community to

866
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,679
be able to share your information with

867
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,320
them

868
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,159
so the only way to facilitate this is

869
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,919
really social interactions

870
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,399
so sadly though we're living in times

871
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,000
where social interactions are tougher

872
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,279
than usual

873
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,679
but for example events like first

874
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,440
conferences are great ways to get to

875
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,880
know your community and to

876
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,440
build this trust and build those those

877
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,200
social relationships that you need to be

878
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,159
able to

879
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,840
to really exchange meaningful

880
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,679
information with the community

881
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,919
so i really encourage everyone that that

882
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,000
wants to partake in information sharing

883
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,360
communities to

884
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,760
to be social to reach out and to get to

885
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,279
know your community because that's the

886
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,880
biggest facilitator for sharing in the

887
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,080
first place

888
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,919
other than that there are obviously some

889
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,600
legal restrictions that you have

890
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,360
that might come up in the entire process

891
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,399
we see this very often with

892
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,080
organizations where the the first

893
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,520
questions that they ask us when they

894
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:09,919
join

895
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,039
in our communities okay how does this

896
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,240
fit into gdpr for example

897
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,559
if my legal team asks me why i'm sharing

898
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,039
any information out what can i

899
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,720
give them as an explanation of why i'm

900
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,799
supposed to or allowed to do this

901
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,159
so if you need any help with that we

902
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,320
have a bunch of compliance documentation

903
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,840
and that we've been working on together

904
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,240
with a bunch of partners

905
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,640
and so we have descriptions for uh how

906
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,799
this fits into the gdpr the nis

907
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,919
directive

908
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,080
and some other frameworks so we just

909
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,360
have a look there and if you have any

910
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,120
questions or if you feel that anything

911
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,000
is not covered let

912
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,640
us know and we keep updating our uh our

913
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,600
documentation

914
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,679
based on on feedback of what's missing

915
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,520
or ideas that we should be incorporating

916
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,559
in there

917
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,279
but generally

918
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,880
what once your legal team is more

919
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,640
familiar with the process and why this

920
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,360
is style

921
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,080
why ensuring security for your

922
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,760
organization and for the data that you

923
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,799
have to secure

924
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,960
is important then it's seen more as a

925
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,640
benefit than a hurdle really

926
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,360
but it it obviously takes time to get

927
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,279
this into your processes to define why

928
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,240
you're

929
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,399
doing what you're doing uh your

930
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,679
retention periods

931
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,200
describing how you're going to handle

932
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,960
data and so on

933
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,520
so this obviously has some ramp up time

934
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,399
but we have

935
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,840
a lot of documentation that will help

936
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,440
you with that there are also some

937
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,960
practical restrictions that we hear from

938
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,559
organizations so very often when

939
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,080
organizations reach out to us

940
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,440
the first thing they say is we don't

941
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,200
really have any information to share

942
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,120
we don't have the capability for example

943
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,880
to build those highly vetted threat

944
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,640
reports that we're so used to from

945
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,440
feed providers and obviously very few

946
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,960
organizations do

947
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,919
with that said information sharing comes

948
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,200
in many different

949
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,600
shapes and sizes for example going back

950
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,200
to the initial use case about

951
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,559
providing feedback from your analysts

952
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,000
about the data that you receive from

953
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,240
your community is already valuable

954
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,840
information sharing so if someone for

955
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,600
example provides sightings

956
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,279
i've also seen this indicator at this

957
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,840
given time

958
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,799
that can already help you tune the data

959
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,360
set

960
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,120
for what goes into your working data

961
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,880
sets for for detection and blocking and

962
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,320
so on

963
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,840
also providing information on false

964
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,960
positives and some information that

965
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,320
provide that you provided

966
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,640
to the community turns out to be false

967
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,880
or something that is no longer relevant

968
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,960
getting information that is valid as

969
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,039
well so pretty much everyone has

970
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,279
information to share by just using the

971
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,399
information and running

972
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,720
into frustration with the data by itself

973
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,000
also besides not having information to

974
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,640
share

975
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,399
there comes also the issue of time

976
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,399
most most of us are overburdened with

977
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,760
the different tasks that we're facing

978
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,799
nowadays

979
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,960
so um taking extra time uh out of the

980
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,600
day to

981
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,679
encode information and to share it out

982
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,039
in the community

983
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,640
is obviously going to be an extra burden

984
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,559
there is no way around it what we try to

985
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,600
do with misper

986
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,440
is to make this process as minimal as

987
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,039
possible but it is going to be a time

988
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,000
investment in the end

989
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,240
after all especially if you want to vet

990
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,840
the data if you want to ensure that you

991
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,960
don't uh

992
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
that you the right data reaches right

993
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,240
but

994
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,840
recipients this always has a time

995
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,480
drain on you as well but in return this

996
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,240
is offset by what you gain

997
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,080
by by sharing that information we're

998
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,440
going to talk about this a little bit

999
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,360
more during the community building part

1000
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,760
about what effects you're going to see

1001
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,279
if you're sharing information and why it

1002
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,640
is relevant for you

1003
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,159
but to to to basically sum it up in one

1004
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,120
sentence

1005
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,960
and whatever affects your organization

1006
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,240
is probably the most important

1007
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,679
information for you and if you get

1008
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,200
feedback on that

1009
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,760
what what you're seeing in your network

1010
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,240
and

1011
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,399
and more eyes on it more perspectives

1012
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,240
more

1013
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,080
perhaps more sophisticated methods of

1014
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,159
research from other organizations

1015
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,519
then that will probably just improve

1016
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,600
your own security posture the best way

1017
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,519
it can

1018
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,919
now besides timeliness and uh and

1019
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,519
basically having information to share

1020
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,880
there's also the issue of different

1021
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,960
classification models so classification

1022
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,240
not just in a sense of

1023
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,519
of deciding who we share information

1024
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,159
with

1025
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,080
but how we classify information really

1026
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,279
in terms of

1027
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,799
uh contextualizating it we are all used

1028
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,240
to naming things

1029
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,320
a certain way in our organizations in

1030
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,159
our communities and we've probably

1031
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,039
been doing it for longer than

1032
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,320
information systems

1033
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,559
digital information systems exist so

1034
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,840
we're probably using a lot of those

1035
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,600
vocabularies that we've been using for

1036
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,640
decades

1037
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,120
and what one of the things that we

1038
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,600
wanted to avoid with misp is to

1039
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,679
get these communities to switch to a

1040
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:46,640
different way

1041
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,120
of describing things so if you already

1042
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,360
have your set methods your set processes

1043
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,960
how you define things

1044
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,480
we don't want to alter that so one of

1045
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,840
the things that we do with misplan we're

1046
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,279
going to talk a fair bit about that

1047
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,799
tomorrow mostly

1048
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,519
is that you have ways to describe your

1049
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,679
own taxonomies and your own vocabularies

1050
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,000
to use those in your community so very

1051
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,120
often when you're spinning up the

1052
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,559
community and when you're starting out

1053
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,200
with the sharing

1054
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,880
community a national sharing community

1055
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,480
sectorial one whatever

1056
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,320
then one of the first tasks is basically

1057
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,399
defining those those common vocabularies

1058
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,720
that you're going to be using

1059
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,640
now apart from the vocabularies

1060
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,320
themselves there is also the issue of

1061
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,039
of us speaking many different languages

1062
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:25,840
in terms of

1063
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,640
of our tools using different formats so

1064
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,519
that means even

1065
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,080
within our own organization which is

1066
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,919
rather small we have a set of different

1067
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:34,640
tools

1068
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,679
that will ingest data in different

1069
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,559
formats

1070
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,559
or will prefer to ingest data in given

1071
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,240
format so one of the things we also try

1072
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,120
to do with ms

1073
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,760
is to act as a hub for all your

1074
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,799
different tools

1075
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,200
that will get their data translated into

1076
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,519
the format that they can best ingest

1077
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,960
obviously this is something where we

1078
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,840
cannot be completely

1079
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,120
100 percent covering all the other

1080
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,519
things that exist out there so one of

1081
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,880
the things we try to do with mist

1082
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,559
is make it as modular as possible and

1083
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,399
it's easy to encode your own formats as

1084
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,279
possible

1085
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,440
we're not going to go deeply into the

1086
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,359
into how to do this during the training

1087
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,440
but if anyone is interested about that

1088
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,040
just

1089
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,399
let us know and we'll point you in the

1090
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,599
right direction where you can find

1091
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,599
documentation on how to modularize and

1092
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,159
how to

1093
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,159
build import and export my usefulness

1094
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,639
so just one side note all the training

1095
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,560
materials are available online

1096
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,320
like martial mentioned we have a gita

1097
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,599
repository with a

1098
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,599
pretty extensive rhythmic files with all

1099
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,000
the material that we provide

1100
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,040
there's a miss book too which includes a

1101
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,800
lot of reference

1102
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,839
to to miss as as you know misspell it's

1103
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,719
pretty large topic coming from from

1104
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,159
technical aspect and

1105
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,079
you you'll see that in a minute about

1106
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,480
the project overview

1107
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
so don't hesitate to go there on the on

1108
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,520
the training

1109
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,359
page on github this one is a good

1110
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,640
reference because it's really pointing

1111
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,640
to the different elements

1112
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,920
that we have we have a huge slide deck

1113
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,240
of

1114
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,560
close to 500 pages of slide deck on the

1115
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,560
music book we have close to 500 pages i

1116
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,680
would not mention the number of pages

1117
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,440
for taxonomies galaxies and front it's

1118
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,720
quite large too

1119
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,520
but really look at this as a kind of way

1120
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,040
to shape what you like

1121
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,240
so it's really there to help you and if

1122
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,520
you see something missing

1123
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,440
uh let us know but we have slides for

1124
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,800
example for for

1125
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,839
system requirements uh things like uh

1126
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,200
for example building community that

1127
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,960
we'll talk tomorrow uh that's

1128
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,440
part of it uh but for more the

1129
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,599
programmatic aspect eti

1130
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,320
how to integrate with miss penson uh how

1131
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,200
to extend it

1132
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,040
to the plenty of slides regarding that

1133
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,800
so it's really a good reference

1134
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
and thanks to martial to share this

1135
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,560
information on the on the chat

1136
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,800
so to just give a quick overview of this

1137
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,720
project and really to show that

1138
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,200
the project is quite large nowadays um

1139
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,400
we basically have

1140
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,839
like four pillars of uh of things in me

1141
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,440
one is obviously the open software

1142
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,200
itself um

1143
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,240
so the initial version in 2012 it was

1144
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,079
the small first small block there

1145
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,240
the miss core software which is like

1146
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,440
just the software

1147
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,800
uh mainly for the uh lamb aspect where

1148
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,400
you have the backend the web interface

1149
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,920
and so on but over the time

1150
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,760
the project extended with multiple

1151
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,960
things so if you look on the github

1152
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,040
repository of mid project we have around

1153
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,800
50 repositories so

1154
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,520
it's pretty large just to summarize what

1155
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,720
are the different one

1156
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,119
we have for example the miss modules um

1157
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:31,920
which is an

1158
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,480
easy way to extend miss so the behavior

1159
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,119
of mist

1160
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,640
on the expansion side on the impor

1161
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,880
export and so on by just writing

1162
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,040
python modules it's super easy to

1163
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,480
develop and use

1164
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,000
and the idea behind is obviously to

1165
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,920
extend myths without knowing

1166
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,960
the core details about the system then

1167
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,440
we have a library called pymist and this

1168
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,359
pie mist library is basically a

1169
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,640
python library to expose a new the

1170
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,320
mispress api so mispass a large

1171
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,200
rest api this one can be quite large but

1172
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,040
by misc is really

1173
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,599
helping you to to for example jet events

1174
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,680
create feet and stuff like that so it's

1175
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,200
really important if you want to

1176
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,359
extend me to have a look at primis that

1177
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,040
is not the only librarian for for

1178
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,480
extending uh

1179
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,520
mystia some in golang you have some

1180
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,440
other in python two you have others in

1181
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,640
java and so on

1182
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,400
but the parameters one is the one that

1183
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,000
is maintained by

1184
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,400
the uh author of myth so it's maintained

1185
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,200
by us and

1186
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,480
you can have a look at this one it's

1187
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,400
really the one that's up to date it's

1188
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,000
really core and part of the system too

1189
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
because we use it for our own tests

1190
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,400
within me then we have different

1191
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,320
repository i will just mention one which

1192
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,359
is

1193
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,760
dashboard the dashboard is an extension

1194
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,560
module

1195
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,839
in mist using what we call the mq

1196
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,839
feed mix so we have a kind of way to

1197
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,160
have kind of a real-time fit

1198
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,400
in this pretense between 012 kafka and

1199
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,800
so on but we wanted to show an example

1200
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,640
application for that and the miss

1201
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,240
dashboard is exactly that

1202
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,880
is a way to really get all the

1203
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,560
information that you're in nisp

1204
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,960
uh into a very nice dashboard and so on

1205
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,920
this is really to

1206
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,760
have a good example of what you can do

1207
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,359
with information within misspen or you

1208
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,240
can use it

1209
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,520
so that's the main pillar you have

1210
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
plenty of other projects but those one

1211
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,079
are the main

1212
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,880
main one then on top of that you have um

1213
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,400
what we call the intelligent knowledge

1214
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,359
database of

1215
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,240
misp um and rush mentioned about the

1216
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,119
difficulty

1217
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,200
sometimes in some organizations to use a

1218
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,280
proper classification and so on

1219
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,520
and we try to ease this in this

1220
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,040
different organization by having a kind

1221
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,640
of library of all the taxonomies that

1222
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,280
exist

1223
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,680
so we started as a very simple one where

1224
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,520
it was just including for example a

1225
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,359
taxonomy like the traffic light protocol

1226
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,440
one first is using it and it's a

1227
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,839
commonly used classification but over

1228
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,119
the time we have seen that many

1229
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,320
organizations have different

1230
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,720
classification and so on so we already

1231
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,320
in advance we prepare all those

1232
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,839
taxonomies in

1233
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,160
possible information let's expose lisp

1234
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,599
and you can enable the one that you want

1235
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,400
so we have around 150 libraries

1236
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,040
ranging from classifications uh specific

1237
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,680
ones for

1238
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,160
intelligence communities uh and some

1239
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,560
other activities so this one is our

1240
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,400
really useful label and you can just

1241
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,440
pick the one that you want and we

1242
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,040
maintain those one

1243
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,960
so we have some that are coming from

1244
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,880
third party some that we are operating

1245
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,040
as with projects or creating

1246
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,040
it's really usually a good source to see

1247
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,720
how other communities are using

1248
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,839
classifying and contextualizing the

1249
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:28,640
information there's nevertheless the

1250
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,480
taxonomy itself was like

1251
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,040
kind of liable those labels were quite

1252
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,520
small

1253
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,760
so it was not like completely extensive

1254
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,960
information so

1255
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,880
over the time we maintain a kind of more

1256
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,040
extensive one called the galaxy

1257
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,079
you will hear the term very often

1258
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,280
those galaxies are defining many things

1259
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,200
for example one of the most common one

1260
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,040
is the trajectory we have a

1261
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,800
huge database of selectors but a lot of

1262
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,400
times it was extended

1263
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
for example microsoft is not using

1264
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,320
tractors for example here this activity

1265
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,359
group is part of the

1266
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,400
of the galaxy uh it's really one that we

1267
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,119
use for different and you can represent

1268
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:05,760
whatever

1269
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,359
galaxy you want so you have a predefined

1270
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,280
set of existing one

1271
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,960
but you can create your own so if you

1272
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,880
have your own product or database

1273
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,400
you can create your own from scratch or

1274
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,480
you can reuse and fork existing ones so

1275
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,280
that's really

1276
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,480
those kind of things that we manage in

1277
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,319
the project is not only code and

1278
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,920
software we manage those kind of

1279
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,040
knowledge base

1280
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,079
uh for intelligent contextualization um

1281
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,760
we have some specific one like the

1282
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,200
notice list this one is a

1283
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,720
pretty small one that you use for the

1284
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,480
gdpr aspect

1285
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,920
but this one can be used for anything

1286
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,480
you want it's for informing

1287
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,359
the analyst or the user of misp when he

1288
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,960
touched some specific information in

1289
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,440
mist

1290
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,040
that could impact for example the legal

1291
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,280
framework and so on it's actively using

1292
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,119
intelligence community

1293
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,280
law enforcement and so on maybe less in

1294
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,960
security operation center but it's

1295
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,880
coming more and more due to the legal

1296
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,880
uh site of information sharing and

1297
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,240
especially storing information that

1298
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,480
might contain personal information

1299
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,680
then we have another one called the

1300
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,480
warning list and um andrasali quickly

1301
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,160
mentioned this kind of of

1302
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,560
recurring problems or false positives

1303
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,160
and the one in list are

1304
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,800
basically list of existing potential for

1305
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,720
politics for example we have lists of

1306
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,560
well-known ipr graphs from microsoft for

1307
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,440
example we have list of

1308
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,920
things like domain names used by google

1309
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,800
and so on so

1310
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,520
that's already helping users to find out

1311
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,599
if something might be a false positive

1312
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,119
and we do that automatically and we

1313
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,560
maintain those libraries because one

1314
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,839
english they're automatically updated

1315
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:30,800
regularly

1316
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,880
um i think we have around 50 lists

1317
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,079
nowadays

1318
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,079
it's it's really useful when you do on a

1319
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,160
day-to-day basis and creating events and

1320
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,680
so on you can really find

1321
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,839
and spot things that might be a false

1322
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,119
positive in advance

1323
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,280
by having those running lists enabled

1324
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,000
and again it's up to the user to select

1325
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,839
one money warning list or to enable

1326
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,040
everything depending on the

1327
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,800
different use case so that's one of

1328
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,480
those pillar

1329
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,920
knowledge base i mean a lot of

1330
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,520
contributions coming from threat parties

1331
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,640
are coming from that

1332
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,720
aspect so it's not really programmers or

1333
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,480
or coders that are contributing there

1334
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,680
but it's more analysts

1335
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,599
and people doing religious intelligence

1336
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,319
or classification and so on is really

1337
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,160
something that is useful for everyone

1338
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,079
without being your direct contributions

1339
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,160
on the code

1340
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,960
then over the times we we we became a

1341
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,720
kind of de facto standard and

1342
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,960
uh nowadays is even more than a de facto

1343
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,480
standard is a standard

1344
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,280
um we published as an interesting

1345
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,200
engineering task force draft

1346
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,760
all those documents especially the core

1347
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,440
format

1348
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,839
and to ease that for the development of

1349
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,200
external tools

1350
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,000
integration and so on um so if you're

1351
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,280
interested you can go to the

1352
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,119
standard website where we describe the

1353
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,319
different standards that we

1354
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,920
published we even co-host standards that

1355
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,200
are for people

1356
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,480
integrating with with um with mist

1357
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,599
and we have specific standards for

1358
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,599
example for the object template

1359
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,800
and that's something that we will talk

1360
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,800
about but that's something that was

1361
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,079
really a need for for

1362
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,839
us from the early beginning of mist a

1363
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,359
lot of organizations want to have their

1364
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,800
own structure of information

1365
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,280
about objects and so on and we have a

1366
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,880
flexible modeling miss to

1367
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,520
really create your own data models and

1368
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,359
this one is standardized too

1369
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,920
and it's really helping sharing

1370
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,359
communities to

1371
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,720
extend miss us wishes and their models

1372
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,319
without breaking the

1373
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,680
the standards itself so that's really

1374
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,119
interesting for for showing you new

1375
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,079
models

1376
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,599
and then next to that we will do

1377
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,079
everything possible to help community

1378
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,800
um and rush mentioned the question of

1379
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,359
the

1380
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,599
legal aspect and i think maybe some of

1381
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,680
you already have this order to

1382
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,640
its legal theme about the information

1383
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,400
sharing policies and so on

1384
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,960
we try to make it easier um so we

1385
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,880
publish this kind of compliance document

1386
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,720
and so on it's part of this project

1387
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,160
everything is open source again so

1388
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,880
everything we do is open source and uh

1389
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,359
on open access you can reuse it and so

1390
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,760
on we have for example a specific

1391
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,400
document about building communities

1392
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,920
which is something that we do within the

1393
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,680
cross size

1394
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,319
project and it's containing kind of best

1395
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,200
practices

1396
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,520
what are kind of agreement that you can

1397
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,960
use when doing a setup of

1398
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,119
sharing communities up to things about

1399
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,280
how to do contextualization and so on

1400
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,440
um so that's that's maybe something that

1401
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,040
for an organization that wants to boost

1402
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,520
up

1403
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,760
an isaac or sharing communities they can

1404
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,119
look at those documents and so on so

1405
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,760
it's again a thing that we try to help

1406
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,200
for example we produce kind of osc feeds

1407
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,800
of existing reports and so on to

1408
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,520
not only have software ready but i have

1409
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,880
to have some some some

1410
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,880
content and to show what kind of

1411
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,560
information can be shared

1412
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,560
within uh different communities

1413
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,680
so to let some get some of the naming

1414
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,880
conventions out of the way

1415
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,400
and before we start really hands-on

1416
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,880
stuff and just a quick explanation of

1417
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,839
the different

1418
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,119
uh data points and uh and naming

1419
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,720
conventions that we use for them so it's

1420
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,400
a bit easier afterwards

1421
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,000
this can be a bit overwhelming don't

1422
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,599
worry we'll go through everything step

1423
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:04,640
by step also

1424
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,000
during the hands-on part so basically

1425
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,520
all the data that goes into mist we

1426
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,359
separate into two main layers

1427
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,440
or one we call data layer which is

1428
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,880
really everything it has to do with

1429
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,160
individual data points they're

1430
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,520
compositioning

1431
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,400
and so on so everything that we share in

1432
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,000
misp in general in this regard

1433
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,359
starts with something that we call an

1434
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,200
event these are our general

1435
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,240
envelopes for information so that means

1436
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:28,560
that

1437
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,960
whenever we're describing an incident

1438
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,960
we're describing a threat report we're

1439
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,480
describing a watch list that we

1440
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,000
recurringly update

1441
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,599
and they will all be grouped into

1442
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,400
something that we call an event

1443
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,760
uh so the name is uh is a little bit

1444
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,680
controversial at times we try to pick a

1445
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,400
name that

1446
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,520
that is at the least amount of a loaded

1447
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,440
term that we could find

1448
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,319
but obviously even with that there it

1449
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,240
can be a bit confusing but just consider

1450
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,359
it as a generic

1451
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,040
container for data that has some

1452
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,880
contextual linking

1453
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,000
then each of these events is populated

1454
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,319
with lists of attributes so attributes

1455
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:07,040
are more

1456
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,839
most basic data points in misp an

1457
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,760
attribute can describe for example an ip

1458
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,280
address

1459
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,240
you can describe describe a file hash or

1460
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,160
it can describe

1461
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,200
a car plate number for example

1462
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,040
there it's basically just an individual

1463
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,599
data point with some basic context

1464
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,760
around it such as

1465
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,400
describing in what context this was seen

1466
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:30,800
in

1467
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,960
what type we're using to describe the

1468
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,440
attribute for example that

1469
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,000
we're using an md5 hash to describe the

1470
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,680
hash of a file

1471
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,680
would be one of those descriptions

1472
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,319
hopefully not used as much these days

1473
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,640
but that's just an example and then we

1474
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,400
can take these individual attributes and

1475
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,599
composite them

1476
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,920
into what we call objects that are

1477
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,319
describing multifaceted

1478
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,119
concepts for example a file object would

1479
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,440
be described by a list of attributes

1480
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,440
including a file name different file

1481
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,480
hashes

1482
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,400
maybe file entropy and so on and so

1483
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,760
forth

1484
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,520
each of these individual objects and

1485
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,960
attributes can then be further

1486
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,440
interlinked by what we call references

1487
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,119
so that means that if we most of the

1488
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,119
time when we're describing data in this

1489
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,040
we're trying to tell a story so we're

1490
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,960
thinking graphs instead of individual

1491
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,000
data points

1492
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,520
that means that we can for example

1493
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,559
describe the entire flow of an attack

1494
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,240
from the initial attack vector all the

1495
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,079
way to the exploitation

1496
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,920
uh using the interconnected graphs using

1497
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,599
these references so we could say

1498
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,680
initially it all started with an email

1499
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,960
that was received

1500
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,680
that contained for example a malicious

1501
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,559
sample

1502
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,480
which then had to send this effect in

1503
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,000
our infrastructure so all of these

1504
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,839
different steps can be then described

1505
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,000
via

1506
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,240
different references there then to

1507
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,520
aggregate this information

1508
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,240
into a and and aggregate the sightings

1509
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,079
of this information we have a structure

1510
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,079
that basically captures sightings from

1511
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,280
our different

1512
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,440
information sources that means if you

1513
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,760
have an ids that is generating alerts

1514
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,839
you can feed information back on when

1515
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,640
when individual attributes were seen

1516
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,880
uh in your network in your premises or

1517
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,160
at your partners and so on

1518
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,839
so this is basically it for the data

1519
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,359
layer these are

1520
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,920
our main building blocks for that now in

1521
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,119
order to contextualize this information

1522
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,599
we have different tools at our disposal

1523
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,760
the most simple one is what we call tags

1524
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,160
these are basic text labels that we

1525
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,000
attach on individual data points or

1526
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,599
entire events

1527
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,680
and these can either be created freely

1528
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,440
or most commonly they come from what we

1529
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,520
call taxonomies

1530
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,880
they're basically standardized

1531
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,400
vocabularies and that are either shared

1532
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,599
by us so the miss project at large

1533
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,520
or by individual communities to their

1534
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,119
members so

1535
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,880
these vocabularies can include anything

1536
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,040
from for example something is simple and

1537
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,040
and commonly used as tlp to national

1538
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,280
classifications

1539
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,839
to various different sectoral

1540
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,319
classifications and so on

1541
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,720
now if you wanted to provide more

1542
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,079
high-level information

1543
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,559
that that we instead of just simple

1544
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,160
labels for the information

1545
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,640
we can use what we call galaxy clusters

1546
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,400
so galaxy cluster is basically a

1547
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,400
knowledge based element that we use as a

1548
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,200
label

1549
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,680
these can be either coming from standard

1550
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,880
libraries

1551
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,720
such as the ones that we maintain or you

1552
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,480
can create them at hawken mess

1553
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,000
that means if you're describing a threat

1554
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,839
actor you could create create a threat

1555
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,440
actor galaxy cluster

1556
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,359
that describes the various metadata

1557
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:36,800
about the threat actor and then use this

1558
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,559
to label your data whenever you think

1559
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:38,880
that

1560
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,640
whatever you're describing is associated

1561
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,160
with a strategy

1562
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,800
you can also create for example a galaxy

1563
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,480
cluster describing the different

1564
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,400
uh uh target sectors and then interlink

1565
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,760
using cluster relationships uh the uh

1566
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,440
the uh threat actor galaxy clusters

1567
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,559
with target sectors

1568
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,440
with exploited tdps and so on and so

1569
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,359
forth so these are the high level

1570
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,040
structures that you can put on top of

1571
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,720
your data basically to further

1572
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,839
contextualize it

1573
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:13,839
alex

1574
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,000
yeah so just to summarize it and that's

1575
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,040
always a

1576
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,200
lot of people are asking about the or do

1577
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,280
you summarize it about

1578
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,920
for example in easy way you have to see

1579
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,319
really

1580
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,079
misprevented as an envelope and then you

1581
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,839
have information inside and then

1582
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,319
what android describe is basically

1583
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,760
different component that you have within

1584
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,800
that envelope and then you have

1585
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,760
contextual

1586
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,680
contextual layers on that envelope and

1587
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,960
relationship that are

1588
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,480
basically based on on that

1589
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,680
so another thing that is very often and

1590
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,319
i think

1591
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,960
it is good to explain it is about the

1592
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,400
terminology between

1593
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,119
indicators attributes and so on that is

1594
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:54,559
a different special indicator of

1595
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,359
compromise and so on

1596
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:00,720
in misp an attribute is close to an

1597
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,440
indicator

1598
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,720
and we have this kind of flexible models

1599
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,599
where

1600
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,200
maybe some of you are familiar with

1601
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,200
observables in myth

1602
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,640
we call it attributes and those

1603
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,400
observables are basically depending on

1604
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,440
the type so

1605
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,640
we have a specific flag in

1606
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,280
in attributes which is basically

1607
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,000
defining

1608
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,400
if information can be used automatically

1609
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,599
for detection and that's

1610
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:24,880
i think one of the most important

1611
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,960
aspects when we talk about attribute in

1612
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,880
mist

1613
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,280
an attribute can become an observable or

1614
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,119
a become an indicator of compromise

1615
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,000
depending on the

1616
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,880
simple flag and this is quite important

1617
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,280
because

1618
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,640
a lot of analysis and so on will depend

1619
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,319
on that and especially or you will use

1620
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:43,599
that afterwards

1621
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,280
if you plan for example to use the data

1622
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,040
into a protective

1623
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,760
systems and so on the ids flags need to

1624
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,280
be set so

1625
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,079
the thing is if i take an example you

1626
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,200
reverse the malware

1627
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,480
and this malware is connected to

1628
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,520
google.com for testing the connectivity

1629
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,119
obviously you will have an attribute for

1630
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,079
example www.google.com

1631
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,680
and this one is an interesting indicator

1632
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,280
for information

1633
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,440
for the analyst so like that you can for

1634
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,400
example

1635
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,160
maybe cluster those kind of malware

1636
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,000
together as in this kind of behavior

1637
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,200
nevertheless

1638
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,640
you are not really interested in that

1639
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,160
information as an indicator of

1640
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,280
compromise

1641
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,680
because it will generate a huge amount

1642
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,480
of

1643
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,599
false positive but if for example at

1644
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:26,960
some point you have an ideology that is

1645
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,640
really dedicated to that malware then

1646
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,520
you will set the ids flag

1647
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,720
so the thing is when you

1648
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,760
uh define in in in missed

1649
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,839
these flags and we will show you later

1650
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:41,599
on it's very important because

1651
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,000
it will define what you can do with

1652
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,119
information later on

1653
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,640
if you're going to automate and so on

1654
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,160
like

1655
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,000
in mix what we try to do too instead of

1656
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,240
having just indicators

1657
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,400
it's very common and i think many of you

1658
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,359
know about it

1659
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,280
you might see for example a list of

1660
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,319
ashes so like for example md5s without

1661
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:01,599
any context

1662
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:02,960
and sometimes it's difficult to know

1663
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,280
exactly what we are talking about um

1664
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,760
are we talking about md5 of malicious

1665
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,720
sample are we

1666
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,599
talking about md5 of legitimate software

1667
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,280
are we talking about the md5

1668
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,040
value of the x55 are we talking about an

1669
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,680
md5 as a mutex in memory we have plenty

1670
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,720
of way of seeing those kind of md5 so

1671
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,760
we try in myth to have what we call the

1672
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,480
kind of

1673
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,480
i would not say kill shine but at least

1674
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,319
contextualization a category that

1675
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:32,880
help to see in which context this has

1676
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,280
been seen

1677
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,000
and as for example f1 and d5 you might

1678
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,119
have a payload delivery

1679
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,559
telling that in which scope this has

1680
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,400
been so that's been in mist

1681
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,440
we have always and complementary type

1682
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,680
so for example for an md5 files you can

1683
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,880
say that this one is

1684
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,599
from a file or is an md5 of a figure

1685
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:52,640
screen

1686
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,000
thing so that means always in miss

1687
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,319
try to have as an indicator all those

1688
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,680
three information together

1689
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,760
so it is giving at least more context

1690
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,359
and if you cannot say this context

1691
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,640
myth will try to automatically set it so

1692
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,280
attributes are equal to indicators but

1693
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,280
with a bit more of information which is

1694
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,240
useful for

1695
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,280
you at least being in a way to

1696
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,720
understand what is in a position to

1697
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,680
understand

1698
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,359
what you have in front of you when you

1699
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:25,359
have to treat those attributes

1700
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:28,400
so this is just a brief

1701
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,920
view of what this looks like we're going

1702
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,680
to see this more in

1703
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,160
practice basically the idea is that that

1704
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,240
all the data that we have in misp

1705
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,799
uh if it's well defined uh allows us to

1706
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,799
draw a graph out of the data and allows

1707
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,880
us to tell a story more easily

1708
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,640
so here we see a simple example

1709
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,799
that basically shows

1710
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,200
the bank account that is associated with

1711
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,480
the threat actor

1712
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,319
uh with all the various different data

1713
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:57,680
points with uh with it

1714
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,280
and then we can basically relate these

1715
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,200
different data points to each other and

1716
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,200
give it give the relationship a term as

1717
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,880
well so in this case we see from the

1718
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,240
chart immediately there

1719
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,160
that that person is the owner of that

1720
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,520
bank account with all those different

1721
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,640
data points

1722
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,119
uh for us as humans it's it's generally

1723
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,079
much more

1724
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,920
easily understood if we look at a graph

1725
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,839
like that and tell the story that way

1726
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:19,760
then if we look at a tabularized view of

1727
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,799
the data

1728
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,480
so one of the goals and something that

1729
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,240
we hope that we get out of

1730
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,280
of going through trainings like these is

1731
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,680
to really convert also the participants

1732
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,480
to uh to see the value of producing data

1733
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,319
in that way instead of just

1734
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:38,558
sharing raw indicator lists for example

1735
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,240
and that's again what's what we think

1736
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,200
that's really important is the

1737
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,280
contextualization again

1738
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,079
so i mentioned we have the galaxies in

1739
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:48,480
mist

1740
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,319
and we have plenty of representation

1741
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,240
headaches and so on and obviously one

1742
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,839
that is quite important is the mighty

1743
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:54,720
attack one

1744
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,240
so might have attack is what only the

1745
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,760
galaxy

1746
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,000
and we have this flexible mosaic mist

1747
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,520
that you can represent those kind of

1748
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,200
matrix-like model

1749
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,040
which is a case for attack which is a

1750
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,880
very convenient way of representing the

1751
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,680
different

1752
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,559
techniques in a progressive way used by

1753
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,480
the attackers and that's exactly what we

1754
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,160
can do in mist so you have this

1755
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,960
kind of model and we have different

1756
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,760
model formats

1757
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,079
so again we have an advanced

1758
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,640
i would say integration with attack but

1759
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,799
you can extend it with multiple

1760
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,359
different kinds of galaxies which are

1761
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:30,000
similar to

1762
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,839
attacks or complementary for example we

1763
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,839
have the individual control system of

1764
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:34,400
attack

1765
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,599
it's a separated galaxy you can even

1766
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,440
create a custom one

1767
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,880
directly in the system and then you can

1768
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,520
filter out your data and so on

1769
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,520
and that's exactly the thing that we why

1770
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,880
we are i would say

1771
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,640
in bracket pushing people to do more

1772
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,480
contextualization it would be useful for

1773
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,599
them at the end

1774
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,040
because this kind of information is

1775
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,119
really

1776
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,079
showing you for example your gap in your

1777
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:58,960
defense

1778
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,280
your specific things that the techniques

1779
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,720
that are not used by an attacker you

1780
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,359
might ask

1781
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,280
why maybe because you are missing a

1782
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,040
specific detection point that you cannot

1783
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,640
detect this kind of attacks

1784
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,640
or things like that so it's really

1785
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,240
actively using the data

1786
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,160
to show something meaningful with it and

1787
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,760
i think attack is one of the way

1788
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,280
but if you can combine this with

1789
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,119
additional information like site links

1790
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:20,720
uh contextualization of the relationship

1791
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,240
between different objects and so on

1792
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,240
basically everything in hand to improve

1793
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,559
your question secure it

1794
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,079
yeah perhaps something to add to this as

1795
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,000
well some of the

1796
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
additional advantages is the moment that

1797
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,839
you encode all this information along

1798
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,720
with the data you can start asking those

1799
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,040
those questions from your tool basically

1800
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,480
for example show me

1801
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,119
uh what sort of threats my my

1802
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:45,200
constituency is facing over the past

1803
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:45,760
year

1804
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,839
and overlaid over how what sort of

1805
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,760
threats it was facing a year ago what

1806
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,680
are the trends that have evolved since

1807
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,319
then

1808
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:53,520
the other thing that it really helps

1809
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,440
with is it also gives you a high level

1810
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,400
overview of in

1811
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,960
individual reports that means if i'm

1812
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,720
looking at an event in misp

1813
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,079
i and it has 800 different attributes

1814
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,079
described in there

1815
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:07,920
making any sense out of that quickly is

1816
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,680
very difficult but getting a high level

1817
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,720
overview using

1818
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,400
a micro attack where you say oh okay

1819
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,559
this this has to deal with spearfishing

1820
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,240
it has to deal with information

1821
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,400
exfiltration so these immediately tell

1822
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,160
me the story of what i'm dealing with

1823
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,680
without having to dig deeper into the

1824
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,079
data

1825
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,720
itself so it is incredibly useful for an

1826
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,480
analyst that is trying to make sense of

1827
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,359
the data that you're sharing

1828
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,760
also as for the sharing itself i mean

1829
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,200
one of the main goals with miss is

1830
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,000
obviously to share

1831
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,520
information we haven't really talked

1832
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,280
about the sharing mechanisms yet

1833
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,880
we basically have a bunch of different

1834
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,880
uh functionalities and myths that we're

1835
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,000
going to see over the next

1836
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,040
two days the deal with distributing the

1837
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,640
information

1838
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,119
one of the most obvious ones to tackle

1839
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,160
is basically who

1840
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,079
is to be the recipient of information

1841
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,280
that we're sharing

1842
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,160
so basically miss we we can basically

1843
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,359
set the distribution

1844
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:03,040
uh settings for each individual data

1845
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,400
point individually

1846
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,559
or for entire collections of data in one

1847
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:07,680
shot so that means if we

1848
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,760
create an event we can decide who we

1849
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,520
share the event with but we can further

1850
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,160
restrict

1851
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,880
individual attributes or objects further

1852
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,440
now

1853
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,839
in who we share the information with

1854
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:19,040
gets decided on

1855
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,319
using one of two different

1856
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,079
means one of them is a simple system

1857
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,440
where we tell miss pure allowed to

1858
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,040
distribute it to everyone that has

1859
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,280
access to this community for example

1860
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,760
or to everyone just that is directly

1861
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,440
connected to my community

1862
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,839
but you can also define more strict

1863
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,760
distribution lists what we call sharing

1864
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,400
groups

1865
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,680
where you individually name the

1866
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,960
organizations that are to be the

1867
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,720
recipients

1868
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,000
now on top of that one of the things

1869
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,960
that we often struggle with

1870
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,119
is especially if you're in some of those

1871
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:52,160
communities

1872
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,000
or you're taking part or assisting some

1873
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,680
of the communities

1874
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,880
where sharing any information might lead

1875
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,040
to reputation or financial loss

1876
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,720
for example in the financial sector we

1877
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,319
have these worries very often

1878
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,480
where if a financial organization were

1879
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,319
to share any information out it could be

1880
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,520
misconstrued

1881
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,839
as a successful attack against them so

1882
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,200
instead they choose to

1883
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,720
basically even if it was something

1884
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,240
completely benign that they caught in

1885
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,240
their sandboxes in their honeypots

1886
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,200
whatever

1887
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,839
and they decide not to share it out of

1888
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:22,400
fear of

1889
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,599
of incurring this reputation loss so one

1890
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,440
of the things that we have in this

1891
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,680
system called delegation where you can

1892
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,920
for example appoint your isac your

1893
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,559
central

1894
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:35,599
uh authority for a community uh

1895
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,880
your a national c cert whatever with the

1896
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,040
responsibility of taking over the data

1897
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,079
that you produce

1898
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,920
and to share it out in their name so

1899
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,480
that that way it's basically a semi

1900
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,559
anonymized information sharing where you

1901
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:49,839
are completely removed from the data

1902
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:50,880
that is shared out

1903
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,599
so the only two parties that will know

1904
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:54,000
who

1905
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
the originator of the data is are you

1906
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,119
and whoever is

1907
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:59,680
is taking over the data and taking over

1908
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,480
the responsibility for the data

1909
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,920
on top of that one of the things that we

1910
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,280
wanted to achieve with this was

1911
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,280
basically to build a collaboration with

1912
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,720
our different partners so it means that

1913
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,520
whenever we're

1914
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,520
sharing information we don't want it to

1915
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,680
be a one-way communication so we don't

1916
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,359
want to have this whole feed provider

1917
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:16,400
and consumers

1918
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,880
uh relationship but we want everyone to

1919
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,799
be able to chip in with their ideas

1920
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,480
so while anything that you produce in

1921
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,559
mist will only be tied and editable by

1922
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,160
your organization others can make

1923
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,720
proposals or counter analysis to it

1924
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,559
so proposals are a system where you can

1925
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:31,920
basically flag

1926
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,280
information as incorrect and provide

1927
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,440
feedback on how to improve it or how you

1928
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,680
can add your own perspective to an event

1929
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,200
so if you receive an event from a third

1930
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,359
party you can say oh i can improve it

1931
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:44,400
and listen this way

1932
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,319
please incorporate these changes in the

1933
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,319
event and then the original producer can

1934
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:49,839
make the decision whether to incorporate

1935
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:50,960
it or discard your

1936
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,520
your changes as for counter analysis

1937
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,359
this is what we call extend events

1938
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,359
you can basically create an event that

1939
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:59,359
that latches onto an original shared by

1940
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:00,640
a third party

1941
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,039
and provide your own perspective of it

1942
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:04,400
and then you keep full control of the

1943
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,160
data and you become the owner of

1944
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,680
whatever the extension is that you

1945
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,440
produce to the original event

1946
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,680
this happens very often for us for

1947
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,280
example when

1948
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,880
when a vendor shares out a report

1949
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,720
for example we get a report from say

1950
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,000
kaspersky and

1951
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,760
we have additional information or we

1952
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,440
have a a a

1953
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,520
different opinion on something then we

1954
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,200
might create an extended event that we

1955
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,960
share out to our constituency

1956
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,280
which which if they have access to the

1957
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,359
original report will latch onto it

1958
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,599
and it will show our perspective on top

1959
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,520
of the original

1960
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,000
now as for the exchange itself every

1961
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,440
organization is free to host their own

1962
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,200
mispencence and then they can decide who

1963
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,960
they want to interconnect with if both

1964
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,480
parties agree

1965
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,240
a synchronization link is established

1966
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,000
between the two mispencences and sharing

1967
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,839
can start flowing between them

1968
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,599
now this this sharing is still governed

1969
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,359
by those distribution lists and by some

1970
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,200
other mechanism that we'll get

1971
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,200
we'll talk about more tomorrow but

1972
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,799
basically and

1973
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,799
mispe exchanges information between the

1974
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:03,920
individual nodes in

1975
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,880
in kind of a mesh network way we also

1976
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,559
have feed system that allows us to

1977
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,799
generate feeds and to share those feeds

1978
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,960
with larger communities so we as circle

1979
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,280
we provide another sim feed for example

1980
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,559
that we make freely available in our

1981
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:20,720
infrastructure anyone can just point

1982
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,440
their mist to it and adjust the data

1983
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,039
and keep it updated using the feed

1984
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,119
system this is also great if you have

1985
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:28,559
ever have the need of sharing

1986
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,640
information between aircraft systems

1987
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,440
you can just generate a feed based on

1988
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,160
certain

1989
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,359
filter rules um and basically basically

1990
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:38,640
share it through

1991
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,000
say a flash drive or something like that

1992
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,280
with an internal system

1993
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,119
now all of these filtering options are

1994
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,720
basically user defined and they rely

1995
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,880
heavily also on the contextualization so

1996
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,319
very often what we're doing

1997
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,640
and especially if you were ever signing

1998
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,319
up for the covidiences that i mentioned

1999
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:57,039
before

2000
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,640
is you can also make those decisions

2001
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,559
based on the context what data you're

2002
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:01,680
interested in what date you're

2003
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,960
interested in sharing out

2004
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,400
for example if you connect to covet

2005
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,400
instance we categorize all of the

2006
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,160
information into three categories

2007
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,079
health related information so basically

2008
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,520
information about the spread of the

2009
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,720
pandemic

2010
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,200
information about misinformation at

2011
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,400
targeting kovid

2012
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,119
and also cyber security uh threats that

2013
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:19,920
are targeting

2014
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,319
uh that are now basically abusing the

2015
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:24,559
whole kobe situation with

2016
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,880
remote work and so on so if you're only

2017
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,760
interested in certain

2018
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,440
in one or two of these three different

2019
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,520
topics then you can set up your filters

2020
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,520
to only ingest data coming from

2021
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,880
a subset of the data set very often what

2022
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,480
we do as well is we have these internal

2023
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,640
mis clusters in our own organization as

2024
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,280
well

2025
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,799
where we collect information from

2026
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:44,640
different sources so we have a dedicated

2027
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,480
miss vincents where we purely collect

2028
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,799
spam information for example so

2029
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,559
for a constituency anyone can forward

2030
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:51,839
their spam to us

2031
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:53,520
and we'll just generate events out of

2032
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,359
those in that lisp generally this

2033
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,039
information is really not

2034
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,960
interesting for a day-to-day detection

2035
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,480
use for example

2036
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,920
but what we do is we cache this

2037
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,680
information and we can cross-correlate

2038
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,119
this information with our operational

2039
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:05,760
instance

2040
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,440
that means if we start the analysis

2041
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,839
process and we we start

2042
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,240
an investigation then we immediately see

2043
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,240
the moment we start encoding data points

2044
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,319
oh this is something that was already

2045
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:17,599
flagged once in our

2046
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:19,359
spam instance this information that that

2047
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,359
instance knows about then we can pivot

2048
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:22,720
over to that instance

2049
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,440
and fetch the information related to

2050
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,960
that same data point that we're also

2051
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,400
seeing in our current incident and

2052
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,079
perhaps get more information that is

2053
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:32,000
relevant for us from there

2054
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,520
so basically very often we have these

2055
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,079
multimis internal enclaves that help us

2056
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:37,760
basically to

2057
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,559
to separate different concerns and

2058
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,240
different collection mechanisms into

2059
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,038
their own instances

2060
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,039
just just in that scope and i think is

2061
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:49,039
linked to the question that we had

2062
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,920
um regarding the military miss pinternal

2063
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:52,799
enclave

2064
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:55,359
someone was asking about synchronizing

2065
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:57,599
with an existing miss penson

2066
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:58,960
you have this kind of local enclave

2067
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,720
options where you can synchronize to me

2068
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,839
like they behave in the same

2069
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:03,920
organization that's one of the

2070
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,200
interesting options

2071
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,359
by the way i would just give the mic to

2072
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:09,359
josh that will explain a bit more about

2073
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:10,960
the question and answer in zoom

2074
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,440
um to have directly the ability to

2075
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,799
answer the question answering

2076
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:18,400
in the market i just want to jump in

2077
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,839
real quick uh yeah if you have any

2078
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:20,640
questions

2079
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,240
uh please direct them at the q a

2080
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,400
board versus the chat room that way we

2081
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,599
can kind of keep a monitor

2082
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,760
of that and other people can actually

2083
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,359
see the questions and the answer

2084
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:33,200
directly in that area so if you have

2085
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,520
questions feel free to use the q a board

2086
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,039
and that's all thank you josh that's

2087
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:39,920
very useful

2088
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,000
um so we can keep track of them and we

2089
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,200
can answer live or

2090
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,760
directly in the chat okay great um so

2091
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:46,720
you see that the sharing

2092
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,520
aspect of risk is like pretty extensive

2093
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,160
um

2094
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,319
and you have different models of of

2095
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:53,280
usage of me

2096
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,720
some people have this pre-consumption

2097
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,480
about me being like oh

2098
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,319
i need to share with me no it's

2099
01:06:58,319 --> 01:06:59,760
depending on what you want to do with

2100
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,119
your misconception

2101
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:02,799
and the core functionality of myths is

2102
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:04,960
really to to give i would say the

2103
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,480
freedom to each of the

2104
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,880
organizations to decide what to do with

2105
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,280
the data if they want to share or not

2106
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,200
and we uh always design myths that

2107
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,359
everyone can be kind of consumers like

2108
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:18,960
basically getting data from different

2109
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,839
fields or producer contributors

2110
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:23,680
uh unless mentioned a different way of

2111
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,520
contributing like

2112
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,160
sightings making proposals things like

2113
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,039
that

2114
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:32,000
but it's up to the original contributors

2115
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,240
to decide if they want to share

2116
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,319
that's really the thing with me speak

2117
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,599
and set up a myth for like

2118
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,480
just pulling data getting the data and

2119
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,119
that's it

2120
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:42,720
and if at one point in time you want to

2121
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,400
like push some data

2122
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,480
you can just enable it and that's it so

2123
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,599
it's really uh

2124
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,920
uh it's just a matter of just tuning the

2125
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,440
configuration the filtering really on

2126
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,640
the synchronization

2127
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,079
if you want to share so you don't have

2128
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:55,839
to change anything in your misp instance

2129
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:57,039
it's just a matter of

2130
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,640
of what you decide and what you need to

2131
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,319
share and then the thing that is really

2132
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,079
important in mist

2133
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,319
everything can be in flex i mean events

2134
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:05,760
for example that we were mentioning so

2135
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,799
those kind of envelope

2136
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:10,240
information might change over time

2137
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,319
we have we have seen for example some

2138
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:13,839
past or a scenery point

2139
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,440
that has been updated like two years

2140
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,960
later because they discover

2141
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,719
who was the target or the character

2142
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,640
behind and that's the thing that's

2143
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,000
really nice that we

2144
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,479
really want to be flexible you can

2145
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,719
really expand the information

2146
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:29,120
either internally add some some common

2147
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,359
and so on and to share this information

2148
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,759
in your different mist instances and

2149
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:35,359
share with partners

2150
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:38,479
your teams and so on so really miss the

2151
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:39,759
core functionality of my

2152
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:42,080
distributing information but if you

2153
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,359
don't want to use it it's fine

2154
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:45,439
you just not you don't just don't enable

2155
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,040
synchronization but if you want to

2156
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,880
use partially part of synchronization

2157
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,399
and so on you just set up

2158
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:53,839
this kind of parameters

2159
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,279
so uh on top of collecting all this

2160
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:01,040
information and synchronizing the

2161
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,040
information that we talked about before

2162
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,560
we basically do a bunch of different

2163
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,319
stuff to improve the uh to handle the

2164
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:08,158
quality management of the information as

2165
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:10,000
well so one of the first things we do

2166
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,279
is this is something we mentioned a bit

2167
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,279
before is we correlate information so

2168
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:14,479
we're interested in data that we've

2169
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:15,839
already seen before

2170
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,279
we also have the feedback loop that we

2171
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:18,560
mentioned before with sightings that

2172
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,279
means what we

2173
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:21,198
we really want to get timeliness to the

2174
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:22,719
information as well

2175
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:25,600
so that we can but make better decisions

2176
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,439
on what we keep in our working data set

2177
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:29,520
for detection for blocking and so on

2178
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,359
the false positive management is a huge

2179
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:33,679
part so warning the willingness system

2180
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:35,279
where we basically exclude those typical

2181
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,359
false positives uh

2182
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,359
plays a very important role in legal

2183
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,439
equation and this is also a community

2184
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:43,120
driven effort so if you want to get

2185
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,399
involved with that and build

2186
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:46,000
and include your own infrastructure for

2187
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,158
example in the warning list and so on

2188
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:50,399
either do it internally for your misport

2189
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:51,679
just share it with the open source

2190
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,279
community as well

2191
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,199
so let us know if you want to have that

2192
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:56,719
included as well we haven't talked about

2193
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,000
enrichment systems yet

2194
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,360
but basically one of the things that we

2195
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,360
do with misplaced we we

2196
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,880
have connectors to all those different

2197
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,239
services that you might already be

2198
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:05,280
subscribed to

2199
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,320
so if you have uh domain tools passive

2200
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,120
total

2201
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,440
or what way or any of the other services

2202
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,600
intel 471 and so on

2203
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,440
that you already subscribed to then you

2204
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,640
can use those

2205
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,239
services to enrich the data that you're

2206
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:19,600
working on so if you have an incident

2207
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,199
and you're encoding information

2208
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:22,719
you go out to all the services that you

2209
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,640
connect that you have access to

2210
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,640
and fetch the information on what else

2211
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,000
those systems know about the different

2212
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,600
data points that you're encoding

2213
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,280
so that you basically get a jump start

2214
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,679
on your on your investigation

2215
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,120
now one of the most important things

2216
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,120
that we have to deal with and this is

2217
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,400
probably i think about 50

2218
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,560
of the code base of misp is basically

2219
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,400
the apis and the libraries that deal

2220
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,560
with integrating misspelled other tools

2221
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,640
so everything that we can do by the ui

2222
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,280
miss is also exposed to the api

2223
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,800
and one of the most important things for

2224
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,960
us is to make sure that that

2225
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,880
you can use mis as simply a back end for

2226
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,960
another tool as opposed to just directly

2227
01:10:58,960 --> 01:10:59,840
using this

2228
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:03,280
itself as for timeliness we haven't

2229
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,640
really touched on that yet

2230
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,640
besides the sighting aspect you can also

2231
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,480
encode information about

2232
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,719
time ranges when something was seen and

2233
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:12,560
you can build a full timeline

2234
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,080
of the events that uh that occurred

2235
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,040
during a set uh set incident for example

2236
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:19,360
so

2237
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,360
if you encode this information together

2238
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,719
with all your data points

2239
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:24,320
then you get an additional graph out of

2240
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,960
it that tells you when what happens

2241
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,560
and time-based correlations are really

2242
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,480
important as well so so very often

2243
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,480
when you're seeing two things happening

2244
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,600
at the same time

2245
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,199
they might be related with each other

2246
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,640
and they might be worth digging into

2247
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:37,120
whether

2248
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,120
there is a link between those two things

2249
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,960
that happened

2250
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,719
so something else that we will touch on

2251
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:44,480
more tomorrow is

2252
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,239
we have a full indicator lifecycle

2253
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:47,760
management system in miss

2254
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,360
that means you can define your own rules

2255
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,960
and tune your own rules on how you're

2256
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:51,760
going to be

2257
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,360
scoring and decaying indicators based on

2258
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,120
all the contextualization that you have

2259
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,719
based on the type of the data that you

2260
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,440
have based on

2261
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,880
source of the information that you have

2262
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,800
and so on and so forth so we're going to

2263
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,040
go into much more detail on that

2264
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:09,840
tomorrow alex

2265
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,199
yeah so i was just answering a question

2266
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,360
and then i will make it public

2267
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,600
in a minute that's a question about the

2268
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,640
kpi

2269
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,000
and using mist there there are different

2270
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,600
ways to evolution to evaluate the

2271
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,880
quality of the information that you

2272
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:29,280
share

2273
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,480
in misp um one of those is obviously to

2274
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,239
look at statistics it's a statistics

2275
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,320
include paging in myths to see for

2276
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,080
example the kind of indicator shared by

2277
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,239
organization and so on

2278
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:43,679
in addition to that um base for example

2279
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,280
miss dashboard which includes a kind of

2280
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,199
gamification of the platforms

2281
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:50,159
and which is giving badges on per

2282
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:51,679
organization depending on the kind of

2283
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,600
information that you share

2284
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,920
and that's a nice way to to find out if

2285
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,600
you are reaching a certain level of

2286
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,520
capabilities when using misc

2287
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,239
uh where you basically have for example

2288
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:05,360
information like

2289
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,199
are you using sightings do you use

2290
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:08,960
objects and and stuff like that for

2291
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:09,600
example

2292
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,679
thing that you can really look at if you

2293
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,040
want to see if the quality of

2294
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,480
information that you create in this

2295
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,040
piece

2296
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,719
i would just following the standards

2297
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:18,560
what is following the best practices in

2298
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,640
the different organization is to compare

2299
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,640
with the q and os in feed there are some

2300
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,199
some goods even in the usa feed

2301
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,600
and for example things that are really a

2302
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,520
good indicator is to see

2303
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,360
are you just using indicators and using

2304
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,880
objects are those objects linked

2305
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,520
together by using the relationship to it

2306
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,280
are you using galaxies are those

2307
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,199
galaxies that are at the even level

2308
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:42,560
absolute levels do you have tags labels

2309
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,600
on specific

2310
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,000
objects or specific attributes and sort

2311
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,920
of different parameters and i think

2312
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,960
the question from uh from hong kong is

2313
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,480
is pretty good so and if you really want

2314
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,040
to

2315
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,960
dive into the kpi aspect of myths and

2316
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,920
quality of information in addition to

2317
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:02,239
what

2318
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:03,920
andras just said there are some some

2319
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,760
other things about the quality of

2320
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,600
information shared within the community

2321
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,120
and there's some some good examples in

2322
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,360
the miss dashboard about the different

2323
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:11,920
budgets

2324
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,719
even the models for sharing such kind of

2325
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:16,480
information

2326
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,080
so another thing that is i think quite

2327
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,920
useful and it was one of the core

2328
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,840
functionality of this was the

2329
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,760
correlation features this one is

2330
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,520
it looks like obvious but it's not

2331
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,120
always obvious i mean a lot of tools in

2332
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,400
the security field exist

2333
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,800
but they don't do automatic correlations

2334
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,560
for example at the ces we are using

2335
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,679
ticketing system

2336
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,120
and sometimes it's very difficult to

2337
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,600
find if we have two correlating events

2338
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,239
and what we decided in misp which covers

2339
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:43,920
the cost i mean the correlation engine

2340
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,239
is maybe one of the costly aspects of

2341
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,640
of using missed on a database level but

2342
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,920
it's really useful um

2343
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,679
for example here we just have an example

2344
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:53,920
of

2345
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,480
information about some malware spam that

2346
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,600
are used

2347
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,719
to share uh information about

2348
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:03,280
target target campaigns for the

2349
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,239
financial

2350
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,480
malware and what we can see there is

2351
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,679
basically correlation

2352
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:10,320
on similar points and those ones are

2353
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,520
mainly epic addresses of the

2354
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,880
infrastructure

2355
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,440
but you can really spot interesting

2356
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,560
things there for example

2357
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,120
you see that the third bone in germany

2358
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:19,679
share

2359
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,840
indicators you have a polish bank

2360
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,080
sharing the same kind of indicators we

2361
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,560
were sharing such kind of indicators too

2362
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,199
and even if they have different names or

2363
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:30,640
different contextualization we can

2364
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,679
really spot

2365
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:33,440
similar infrastructure so we can see

2366
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,040
okay it's maybe the same

2367
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,600
actors using an infrastructure for

2368
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,199
different kind of things

2369
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,520
or for example we can actually see here

2370
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,440
that we have different

2371
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,679
names of the similar malware so really

2372
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:47,280
this is important for example another

2373
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:47,920
thing that is

2374
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,600
interesting is for example if you have a

2375
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,120
simple hyperlapse

2376
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,440
set up by a non-civilized company for

2377
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,960
example you can directly spot it

2378
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,600
i mean if you have i don't know apt-29

2379
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,560
and you have like

2380
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,560
three different criminals malware going

2381
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,840
on that one and so on

2382
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,840
obviously it's usually not the same

2383
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,600
infrastructures but on the other hand

2384
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,120
you can directly spot okay this one is

2385
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,520
already take down it's handled by this

2386
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,040
antivirus company and you can you can

2387
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,159
really handle it

2388
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,719
so it's really a way to quickly find if

2389
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,679
it's a new thread

2390
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:18,080
or or something that is already known in

2391
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:21,840
the in the infrastructure

2392
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,520
so a little bit of the sightings

2393
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,120
themselves so we're going to see this

2394
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,640
more in practice

2395
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,080
uh basically we have a

2396
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,760
very simple interfacing list that allows

2397
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,080
us to to tell

2398
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,080
the community that we've seen an

2399
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,159
indicator as well when we've seen it

2400
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,320
and perhaps also include information on

2401
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,760
what tool we've picked up

2402
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,239
what context we've seen so sightings can

2403
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:47,520
have some metadata

2404
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,159
on top of just being a sighting we can

2405
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:51,360
also flag

2406
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,400
something that we call negative

2407
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,080
sightings which is a false positive

2408
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:54,800
sighting

2409
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,719
where we indicate that we've seen it but

2410
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:58,560
it produced issues for us so it was a

2411
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,000
false positive

2412
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,239
we can also indicate that something is

2413
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:04,560
uh is potentially going to be expired at

2414
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,520
a certain date

2415
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,440
so this is interesting for example if

2416
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,560
we're in talks with an

2417
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,400
uh with a provider and we know that

2418
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,920
there is going to be a takedown

2419
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,520
then we can already indicate that okay

2420
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,280
this is no longer an indicator after a

2421
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,600
certain point in time

2422
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,920
apart from that if you are ever dealing

2423
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,679
with bulk sightings so if you want to

2424
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:22,880
for example just

2425
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,880
capture any ip address

2426
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,560
seen in your network or something like

2427
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,000
that there is another tool

2428
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,560
called citing db and which is developed

2429
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,640
by divo it's also an open source tool

2430
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,239
uh it's really recommended to use that

2431
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,080
it allows you to to capture

2432
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,920
massive massive amounts of data so if

2433
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,440
you're capturing the entire

2434
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,600
network flow of your of your

2435
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,640
constituency

2436
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,640
and bear your organization and just

2437
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:47,840
dumping all the data

2438
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,920
uh somewhere this is a great place to do

2439
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,159
it and it's a very fast lookup database

2440
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:53,760
that is integrated with misp

2441
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,159
where miss can automatically just query

2442
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:57,840
it for any of the indicators that you're

2443
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,679
seeing in expansion whether

2444
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,719
it was seen in your network and in which

2445
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,000
time range it was seen and the

2446
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,360
interesting thing with that is

2447
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:08,960
but it's also for historical values so

2448
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,040
if you're just doing bulk collection of

2449
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,280
uh of all the observables in your

2450
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,239
network

2451
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:16,400
and then even half a year later if it

2452
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,679
turns out that

2453
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,840
then that you an indicator is being

2454
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:20,800
shared with you that

2455
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,920
that correlates with with an observable

2456
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,920
that uh inciting db from half a year ago

2457
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,040
then you know that you might need to

2458
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,560
launch an investigation into something

2459
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,159
that happened half a year ago in relugs

2460
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:33,360
and so on

2461
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:40,880
based on the historic uh look up alex

2462
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,120
just just complementary notes regarding

2463
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,719
sightings and

2464
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,400
that's something that is basically maybe

2465
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,560
the easiest way of sharing additional

2466
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:49,440
information

2467
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,320
it costs nothing and if you are

2468
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,840
connected to a misp instance and you can

2469
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:54,159
tell

2470
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:56,320
someone else that you have seen it it's

2471
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,440
it's really a

2472
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,280
quick thing that can be useful for many

2473
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,280
many many organizations so

2474
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:04,159
the sighting itself sounds like a very

2475
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:05,120
small feature

2476
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,320
but at the end it's a an easy one for

2477
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,400
for contributing and helping the others

2478
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,920
to know if an indicator is still

2479
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,000
valuable and so on society

2480
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,040
is really something that um that can

2481
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,880
basically be a kind of of entry-level

2482
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:19,920
things to do

2483
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:23,760
when when sharing information

2484
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,520
something else that we have in misspell

2485
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,280
this one is i think becoming more and

2486
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:28,560
more important and

2487
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,960
we will do a quick demo later on uh

2488
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,239
regarding that

2489
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:35,280
it's a timeline i mean when we do

2490
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,920
uh analysis and so on it's really i

2491
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,760
would say common to have a first-in-last

2492
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,280
scene to see the evolution of things

2493
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,159
over time

2494
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:44,320
um in the example that you see on the

2495
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,199
screen there

2496
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:47,199
uh it's based on specific characters

2497
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,320
that center

2498
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,840
a significant numbers of

2499
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,880
um of specifying and those

2500
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:55,679
perfectionists

2501
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,080
uh uh very well known when we collect

2502
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:58,719
those

2503
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,560
times time and so on so you can really

2504
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,239
see and enter the evolution of a

2505
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:04,400
specific group and so on um this

2506
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,880
can be done automatically for example

2507
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,800
passive dns records i have

2508
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,719
very often the first in-last scene and

2509
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:12,400
automatically you can really

2510
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,800
build and create this kind of timeline

2511
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,400
because it can be really cumbersome if

2512
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:16,719
you

2513
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:18,639
you have to do it manually um so we have

2514
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:20,000
a nice view like that so that means

2515
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,239
every time you set a first in-last scene

2516
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:24,239
on any attribute object and so on it

2517
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:26,880
automatically purposes on the timelines

2518
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,679
and it's an easy way to to see evolution

2519
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:31,120
trend and so on for your

2520
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,840
analysis

2521
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,600
and this is a completely interactive so

2522
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,280
you can navigate over that but you can

2523
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,440
we can we will show that later

2524
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,520
so for life cycle management again this

2525
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,040
is something that we show briefly but

2526
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,639
we're going to way more depth about that

2527
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:50,400
tomorrow is basically here

2528
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,480
we see some examples of some uh

2529
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,520
attributes

2530
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,520
that have uh scores applied to them

2531
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,639
coming from different

2532
01:20:56,639 --> 01:21:00,080
uh uh scoring models so we see there an

2533
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,080
ids simple decaying model

2534
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,800
and then a custom model titled model 5

2535
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:05,440
that are

2536
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,280
basically running on each of those

2537
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,520
indicators and they generate a score

2538
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,760
taking into account for things such as

2539
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,080
labels that are attached to them the

2540
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:14,800
timestamp

2541
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,920
on when the attribute was created as

2542
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,520
well as the timestamp of the different

2543
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,480
sightings that came

2544
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,080
in so generally if something is still

2545
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,400
being actively seen in your network

2546
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,920
that is still relevant despite the

2547
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,400
indicator itself being perhaps older

2548
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,560
and then using the score that gets

2549
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,239
generated from these different models

2550
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:33,520
that you define

2551
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,719
you can basically then make those

2552
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:36,560
decisions when you're exporting data to

2553
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,320
only include

2554
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,000
data above a certain threshold when

2555
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,840
you're feeding your seam for example

2556
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,560
yeah and this one is quite interesting

2557
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,159
because you can really

2558
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:50,159
define it so the thing that is really

2559
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,280
important with the

2560
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,920
decaying of indicators you are not

2561
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,800
modifying that

2562
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,440
actually you are really just updating

2563
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,480
and overlapping

2564
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,000
and you can just define those kind of

2565
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,760
models so that means for example

2566
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,520
even within a team where you don't agree

2567
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,040
on a specific model you can have both

2568
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:05,760
models

2569
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,199
it's very common for example to have

2570
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:09,679
models for infusion detection systems

2571
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:13,360
and specific models for i don't know

2572
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,760
endpoint the air or endpoint protection

2573
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,719
device

2574
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:19,040
and it means you have even a models or

2575
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,639
kind of simulator

2576
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:23,920
where you can simulate the different

2577
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,360
model that you want to apply

2578
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,199
and to see what kind of lifetime you

2579
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:29,920
want to apply uh when it decay

2580
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,440
when for example you have a specific

2581
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,440
threshold where basically say okay you

2582
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,600
don't use anymore those kind of data

2583
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,520
and you can do the mapping

2584
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,800
with specific taxonomies you can

2585
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,800
with the different types attributes and

2586
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:45,840
so on directly

2587
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,960
directly missed and it is really a quick

2588
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,600
queen so

2589
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,520
you are not bound for example we know

2590
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,679
that some some tips for example have a

2591
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:54,480
kind of

2592
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,880
white system-wide decaying models in

2593
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,480
this case not like that

2594
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:01,679
everyone has their models we are sharing

2595
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:03,280
some models and you can define what you

2596
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,239
want to use

2597
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:06,400
without really altering the data so that

2598
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,920
means this kind of

2599
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,239
of information there is just an overlay

2600
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:12,480
and and you actually keep your own data

2601
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,080
in the systems without having

2602
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,360
any modification

2603
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,040
so very

2604
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,360
so when it comes to starting out one of

2605
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,960
the trickiest things obviously is when

2606
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,400
you're starting out with mist

2607
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,920
is if you're steering as an empty

2608
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,199
instance then getting started and

2609
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:37,280
encoding information is really tough

2610
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,400
because you don't know what is really

2611
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,000
expected from the communities out there

2612
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:40,719
you don't know

2613
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:42,800
it's a new tool you don't really know

2614
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,719
what uh how to get started

2615
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,960
so in order to ease this a little bit uh

2616
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,320
there are a bunch of different feeds

2617
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,239
some of those that we we also provide

2618
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:51,600
ourselves

2619
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,120
which is obviously operational

2620
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,560
information something that you can use

2621
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,159
directly so

2622
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:57,920
these are western feeds that we produce

2623
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,800
as well from our tlp white data set

2624
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,400
and the idea is that this will really

2625
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:05,120
help with bootstrapping your processes

2626
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,560
look at the data we consider that

2627
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,560
generally well-formed and well

2628
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:09,600
contextualized

2629
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,199
it should give you an idea of what data

2630
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:13,280
generally looks like in this so

2631
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:15,280
don't start out with a fresh instance

2632
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,120
just go to your feed menu in your miss

2633
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,400
when you're installing it

2634
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,880
and pull in some of these uh osm feeds

2635
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,159
so that you see the information already

2636
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,159
also it's a great way to test your

2637
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:27,360
internal tooling

2638
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,120
so if you want to test the apis if you

2639
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,120
want to test internal synchronization

2640
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,800
it's good to have a larger data set

2641
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,159
already from the get go

2642
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:35,679
so that you already see that the

2643
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:37,360
movement of the data is working as

2644
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,040
expected

2645
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,840
uh yeah the other thing that you can do

2646
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,840
and where we're going to talk about that

2647
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,199
quite a bit tomorrow

2648
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:49,199
uh is basically figuring out which feeds

2649
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:50,960
are worth ingesting

2650
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,800
how the feeds compare to each other

2651
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,719
running overlap analysis between them

2652
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:55,520
and so on

2653
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,679
so this is something that this is quite

2654
01:24:57,679 --> 01:24:59,040
a heavy topic

2655
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,679
for tomorrow

2656
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,639
you're muted alex yeah yeah yeah just

2657
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:10,639
discover music

2658
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:12,719
so as you can see for for me it's the

2659
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:14,719
development of mysteries done

2660
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,120
over the years based on the feedback of

2661
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,560
users and that's really one of the key

2662
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:19,760
elements for us

2663
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,520
uh we we wanted a tool for us that works

2664
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,239
and i think it's key and based on that

2665
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:27,440
we wanted something that works for

2666
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:28,880
others too

2667
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,120
and i mean the tool is evolving over

2668
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,560
time so you see that we have plenty of

2669
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,679
functionalities

2670
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:35,840
on those two two days of workshop we'll

2671
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:38,080
try to cover a part of it

2672
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,280
we had already some good questions

2673
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,120
regarding how to customize this and so

2674
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:41,679
on

2675
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:43,679
uh we might give you some hints how to

2676
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:45,120
do it and and so on

2677
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,960
so we won't be able to cover everything

2678
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,239
in those two days but

2679
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:51,600
you'll see that you can really um update

2680
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,600
myths based on your specific use cases

2681
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,480
and so on so

2682
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,360
this is there as a tool um what is

2683
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,280
really usually matters another what are

2684
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,560
the successful

2685
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,560
i would say sharing communities depends

2686
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,320
on all the practices

2687
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,120
um or you you do that and so on and we

2688
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,040
really want at least at the end

2689
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,520
even if it's a complex tool and so on to

2690
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,199
be as easy as possible

2691
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,520
for covering different use case and

2692
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,800
that's really the thing that we want to

2693
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,320
do is for example for a lot of things

2694
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,520
that we have in this

2695
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:20,960
and someone just asked the questions

2696
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,679
about how can you customize me

2697
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:25,199
a lot of things you missed can be

2698
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:27,120
customized by just modifying some json

2699
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,159
files

2700
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:29,840
it's a case for miss objects so if you

2701
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,520
want to create a new object

2702
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,400
you just update the json files if you

2703
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,679
want to for example create a new

2704
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:36,719
taxonomies

2705
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:39,440
or uh creating a new galaxy you just

2706
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,360
create those kind of json files

2707
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,840
you have other ways to update and and

2708
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,159
and change the behavior of mist

2709
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,159
it's based for example on this modules

2710
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:50,000
so if you want to change the behavior of

2711
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,440
the expansion and so on

2712
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,199
you can just play with miss produce and

2713
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:54,800
we will

2714
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,800
quickly show you some examples on these

2715
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,560
modules um

2716
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,400
but that's that's really that's really

2717
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,080
simple i mean there's no another thing

2718
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:02,880
so

2719
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,199
and that's the thing that you have to to

2720
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:06,239
understand with myth

2721
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:09,120
project is not just a small open source

2722
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,800
software somewhere it's really a

2723
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,120
a set of of combination of a tool

2724
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,000
software packages open standards various

2725
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,360
best practices

2726
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,760
shared knowledge base and obviously the

2727
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,040
community is using it

2728
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,639
so that's really the thing that we will

2729
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,960
have we love with first for example it

2730
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,960
is to have this kind of community

2731
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,000
learning together

2732
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,679
sharing information and so that's that's

2733
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:33,120
really a key

2734
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:36,239
key for us um we have i think

2735
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:39,199
more than 500 contributors on on the

2736
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:40,000
project

2737
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,719
even more nowadays um so if you want to

2738
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:44,320
become one of the contributors it's

2739
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,080
really straightforward i mean if you

2740
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,679
have something that's a problem that you

2741
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:48,800
want to solve

2742
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,320
for example on an object you just do a

2743
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,400
pull request and you you it will be

2744
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,840
misspelled immediately and you become a

2745
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,520
contributor in the project so

2746
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,679
really for us it's uh it's really keen

2747
01:27:57,679 --> 01:27:59,600
in mispis to have a kind of tool that is

2748
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,040
supporting the different

2749
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:04,480
use cases okay so um

2750
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,239
before that we do a break i will share

2751
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,760
you with you some

2752
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,320
practical details on accessing the miss

2753
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,600
training instance because there were

2754
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,199
some questions regarding that

2755
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:17,679
and after the break we will do um

2756
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:21,040
the hands-on practical session

2757
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,199
with an example so we will heal examples

2758
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:25,360
of you you will hear the full event

2759
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,840
based on some information that you

2760
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:30,159
receive so first of all i will

2761
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:34,080
give you some details about how to

2762
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:37,920
access the mispinstance

2763
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,760
so first of all we have i candy

2764
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:44,960
page which i obviously share at some

2765
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,480
point in time

2766
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:49,520
and i will share it again

2767
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,800
yes so there's a page

2768
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,760
i can do pages you can even edit i will

2769
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:56,080
i will

2770
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,840
paste the link again in the chat for

2771
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,320
everyone

2772
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:09,840
that's the link so we have a 50 account

2773
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:10,320
on that

2774
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:14,159
training instance pick randomly one

2775
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:16,000
it doesn't matter if you are multiple

2776
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,679
one using the same account

2777
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:19,440
but be careful don't change the password

2778
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,120
because maybe some people

2779
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,800
will complain and then we have a

2780
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,920
training first on 2021

2781
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,800
uh password so super simple uh not so

2782
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,920
secure but that's fine it's

2783
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,360
trending um

2784
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:38,880
you just for the reference uh we uh

2785
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,480
for the one that doesn't want to use the

2786
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,400
training instance sometimes you

2787
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,920
for whatever reason you want to use your

2788
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,000
own instance we have virtual images

2789
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,760
uh visual box and and um vmware images

2790
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:50,239
for

2791
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:52,800
misp so if you want to play with me

2792
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,159
locally and so on

2793
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:55,760
if you want to play with synchronization

2794
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:59,280
too you can even connect those two

2795
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,920
so and during the sessions we will

2796
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,679
connect to that instance so

2797
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:07,120
the instant is igloo.u

2798
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:11,280
and when you connect you will get access

2799
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,639
to um to the intense instance so you

2800
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:16,159
enter your training password so you will

2801
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:17,199
enter with my

2802
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:20,400
specific account and we will use that

2803
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,880
instance for the enzyme that we will do

2804
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:24,400
just after the break so

2805
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,400
what i propose now is to do a 15 minute

2806
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,080
break and we start

2807
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:32,560
at 45 if it's fine for everyone

2808
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,880
and we will start by with the practical

2809
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,000
sessions

2810
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,600
with a specific emails

2811
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,400
that we will share in the accmd as a as

2812
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,400
a practical example

2813
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,280
so thank you for the one that join us

2814
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:47,920
now

2815
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:51,360
and we will start again at 45

2816
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,679
to do the hands-on session thank you

2817
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:55,679
very much

2818
01:30:55,679 --> 01:31:03,840
thank you

2819
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:15,119
okay and shall we get started

2820
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:20,080
sure welcome back everyone

2821
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:22,560
okay so now what we're going to be doing

2822
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,400
is we're going to look a little bit

2823
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,080
at miss pizza so we've talked plenty

2824
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,679
about it but we haven't actually done

2825
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:28,960
anything with it yet

2826
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:30,560
so i really encourage everyone that has

2827
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,560
a misfits to also play along

2828
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:35,199
and to create your own events what we're

2829
01:44:35,199 --> 01:44:36,800
going to be doing is we're going to go

2830
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:37,440
through as

2831
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:40,639
any fictional little exercise assume

2832
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:41,360
that you

2833
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,000
that you receive an email from uh in

2834
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:44,800
this case

2835
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,560
luxembourg english telco this is certain

2836
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:49,840
of them describing an incident of a very

2837
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:52,080
simplistic incident

2838
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:53,520
of what happened what we're going to be

2839
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:56,480
trying to do now is to model this a miss

2840
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:59,280
and to explain how you can further

2841
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,840
improve it and contextualize this

2842
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:02,800
information

2843
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,040
so before we start uh once you're logged

2844
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:06,239
into the

2845
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:08,639
into miss pinsons such as the hosted

2846
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:09,679
training instance

2847
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:11,360
this is what you're going to be seeing

2848
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:13,840
so it's a it's a little bit squeezed on

2849
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,199
alex's screen

2850
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:18,639
but the idea is that you have a list of

2851
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:21,600
events that are listed on the main page

2852
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,280
so we're in the event index this is our

2853
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,280
landing page when we load up misp

2854
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:26,719
and each of these individual lines

2855
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:28,080
represents an event so they're

2856
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:30,159
describing either an attack

2857
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:33,520
or perhaps a report recurring

2858
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:34,960
distribution

2859
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:38,800
or a certain type of of indicator lists

2860
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,000
and so on

2861
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,600
so what you're seeing here is you have

2862
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,440
each of these events having an id

2863
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,679
and some metadata around it so these are

2864
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:47,360
this metadata can be either coming from

2865
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:48,960
this galaxy cluster

2866
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,719
system that we mentioned for example

2867
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,639
describing different

2868
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:55,679
attacker techniques the different types

2869
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:56,880
of

2870
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:58,560
ransomwares in this case or attack

2871
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,560
patterns that are leveraged

2872
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,000
and then if we scroll a bit further

2873
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,520
right so this is a bit lower resolution

2874
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:04,320
there that we see

2875
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,800
but uh you should have it visible on the

2876
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:07,920
same page

2877
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:12,159
um you see the information about uh

2878
01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:14,239
what this event is trying to describe to

2879
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:15,440
us

2880
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,199
it's simple to understand text-based

2881
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:19,600
representation now this instance is used

2882
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,199
for trainings in general so it's going

2883
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:22,719
to be filled with a lot of junk

2884
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:24,560
interspersed with real data that is

2885
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:27,040
coming from our tlp wide feed

2886
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:28,800
so you're going to see some obviously

2887
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:31,679
weird events in there

2888
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:33,840
these are just there for testing just

2889
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,840
players playing during an exercise and

2890
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,199
so on

2891
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:40,159
but also some real events there so what

2892
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:41,440
we're going to be doing now is we're

2893
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:43,119
going to create our own event based on

2894
01:46:43,119 --> 01:46:44,880
that email that we received it's also on

2895
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:45,760
the hackamd

2896
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,600
page so just have a look at email

2897
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:48,880
exactly

2898
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:51,119
and we need to start encoding with that

2899
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:52,239
event

2900
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:54,320
so before we include anything in misp

2901
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:55,840
the first thing that we need to do

2902
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:57,920
is we need to create a new event so this

2903
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,239
is where everything starts

2904
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:02,400
way to do it is to just click on add

2905
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:04,239
event on the left side of the menu

2906
01:47:04,239 --> 01:47:05,360
and then you start with a very

2907
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:07,360
simplistic form that where we can

2908
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:11,199
describe the event in a very high level

2909
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:13,679
so here you see it's it's the first step

2910
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:15,119
is very straightforward

2911
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:16,400
the import the things that we have to

2912
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:17,920
watch out for or here is we already

2913
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:18,480
decide

2914
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,239
who gets to see the event so this is the

2915
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:22,639
distribution level and that we need to

2916
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:23,280
set and

2917
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,520
basically a basic description of it as

2918
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,600
for the distribution itself

2919
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,159
you have different uh ways of

2920
01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:32,159
interacting with the data here already

2921
01:47:32,159 --> 01:47:33,679
so one of the decisions that you have to

2922
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:35,360
make even if you're going to share to

2923
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:35,760
the

2924
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:37,760
wider community out there is do i keep

2925
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:40,000
this internal until i'm ready to share

2926
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,119
it with the community

2927
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:43,119
or do i already make it visible to

2928
01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:44,719
anyone that has access to the data in

2929
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:46,560
the community

2930
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,960
now keep in mind that we have a

2931
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:50,800
publishing process in misp so until an

2932
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,080
event is published

2933
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:54,320
it is not propagated out to other missed

2934
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:55,119
instances

2935
01:47:55,119 --> 01:47:56,639
that means anyone on the current miss

2936
01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:58,159
pencils can see the data

2937
01:47:58,159 --> 01:47:59,679
but it will not jump to a different

2938
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:02,000
misspen since at this point in any way

2939
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,320
but if you if you're creating it on a

2940
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:05,440
hosted instance

2941
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:07,679
for example if you if your isak is

2942
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:08,800
running a miss pinstance and you're

2943
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:10,320
creating it on that one directly

2944
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,840
then this already has an impact on who

2945
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:14,000
can see the data

2946
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,400
so the option here either go with your

2947
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:18,000
organization only and then

2948
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,520
raise the distribution level once it's

2949
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,679
ready to be released or you already

2950
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:23,840
involve addressing the process and you

2951
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,440
pick something like community only where

2952
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:27,280
others can chip in with their ideas from

2953
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:28,320
the get-go

2954
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:30,960
so this is up to you it's a risk versus

2955
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:32,560
efficiency question

2956
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,719
do i want to share the information and

2957
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:35,600
potentially

2958
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,760
overshare a bit by including by

2959
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,199
accidentally uploading information that

2960
01:48:39,199 --> 01:48:40,960
is not yet

2961
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:43,199
confirmed that it can be shared out

2962
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:45,679
versus losing out on perhaps others

2963
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:47,440
immediately jumping on board and saying

2964
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:49,119
okay this is also something we've seen

2965
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:50,400
we've already done the analysis of it

2966
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,600
here you go

2967
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:53,600
so you have to balance those two things

2968
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:54,960
out so let's start

2969
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:59,040
no for example for example what

2970
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:01,920
you have is when people are working on a

2971
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:03,360
case by default they say

2972
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:06,960
it's organization and at one point in

2973
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:08,080
time

2974
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:10,080
the team lead for example decide at some

2975
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:11,840
point it's okay no you can share it

2976
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:13,360
to a wider community and then you change

2977
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:16,239
the distribution level

2978
01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:17,840
yeah indeed so let's start with the

2979
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,520
organization only for now uh

2980
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:20,800
for different reasons that we'll get

2981
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,560
back to later on it allows us to show

2982
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,000
off another feature afterwards that is

2983
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,119
handy

2984
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:26,800
so we start with that then we have to

2985
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:28,639
describe this the threat level so this

2986
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:29,199
is

2987
01:49:29,199 --> 01:49:31,840
a very subjective question uh threat

2988
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,599
level will depend a lot on what sort of

2989
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:34,800
an organization you are

2990
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,560
versus who you're sharing it with so we

2991
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,000
all have different interpretations of

2992
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,400
what we consider a high threat level

2993
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:41,760
we have some descriptions for each of

2994
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,679
these fields uh

2995
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:45,520
predefined if you click on the little

2996
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:46,800
information box

2997
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:49,199
it will tell you that hi is uh

2998
01:49:49,199 --> 01:49:51,520
sophisticated apt malware or zero day

2999
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,520
attack

3000
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:55,040
please just freely disregard this

3001
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:57,599
because nowadays a lot of information

3002
01:49:57,599 --> 01:49:58,480
sharing

3003
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,159
happens in completely different domains

3004
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:02,080
so if a fraud team is sharing

3005
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:03,599
information about

3006
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:06,880
fraudster their definition of high

3007
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:08,400
threat level would be very different

3008
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:08,719
from

3009
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:11,440
those in cyber security for example so

3010
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,199
generally it's just a subjective

3011
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:15,520
first measure but a lot of organizations

3012
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:17,199
users use this to briefly filter out

3013
01:50:17,199 --> 01:50:19,040
what they should tackle first

3014
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:21,440
so still use it with care if you don't

3015
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,960
want to use this field

3016
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:25,760
picking undefined is fine too analysis

3017
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:27,679
the next field describes how far along

3018
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:30,560
you've come with the analysis process

3019
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:33,040
so basically uh with this what you're

3020
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,480
telling the communities i'm just

3021
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,159
starting out with the analysis

3022
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:39,119
these are my initial findings versus for

3023
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:40,719
example saying that my analysis process

3024
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:41,840
is already complete

3025
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:44,960
i'm not going to be digging more for now

3026
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:48,000
i consider this complete if you have

3027
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,840
additional information then obviously

3028
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:54,960
uh already start collaborating with us

3029
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:56,880
so just pick whichever is most

3030
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:58,400
appropriate for you let's just go with

3031
01:50:58,400 --> 01:50:59,840
initial for now

3032
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,679
and then comes the most important part

3033
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:04,159
of this form which is

3034
01:51:04,159 --> 01:51:06,320
describing the event info so this is a

3035
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,320
brief description for analysts that are

3036
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:10,159
looking at the data that describe

3037
01:51:10,159 --> 01:51:12,080
the best described the event that you're

3038
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:13,199
basically uh

3039
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:16,719
sharing now be brief here and be careful

3040
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:17,679
about

3041
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:20,480
including very domain or organization

3042
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:22,639
specific information one of the mistakes

3043
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:23,280
that

3044
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:25,280
that people often make here is for

3045
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:26,320
example uh

3046
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:29,360
typing a ticket number or ticket id in

3047
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:30,480
there

3048
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:32,159
so if you have a ticketing system and

3049
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:33,760
you basically start your investigation

3050
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:35,199
from your ticketing system

3051
01:51:35,199 --> 01:51:36,800
sharing out something like what alex has

3052
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,719
typed there is not very handy for anyone

3053
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:40,239
else nobody will have a clue what you

3054
01:51:40,239 --> 01:51:41,679
mean with that

3055
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:43,199
another mistake that can happen here

3056
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:44,639
very often is especially if you're

3057
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:46,000
starting out small and

3058
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,840
in turn initially you're only keeping

3059
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:49,760
the events for yourself

3060
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:51,520
and then perhaps later on you decide

3061
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:53,760
that you want to maybe perhaps

3062
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:56,159
after all share it out to a community

3063
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:57,520
then one of the things that can really

3064
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:58,960
hurt you at that point is if you've

3065
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:00,719
used different language for example to

3066
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:02,320
describe the event info so we've seen

3067
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:03,520
this very often

3068
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:06,639
we instead of describing the things in

3069
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:07,360
english we

3070
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:10,480
choose our own languages

3071
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:16,719
and myself is hungarian we are we're

3072
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:18,080
pretty prone to doing this

3073
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:21,599
in general uh and this is generally

3074
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:22,639
something that will hurt us

3075
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:24,400
in the long term because uh once you

3076
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:25,920
share it out with a more

3077
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:28,400
international community you either have

3078
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:30,080
to go through the effort of translating

3079
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,800
it or basically make it illegible for

3080
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:34,400
the recipient

3081
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,800
so stick to something simple simple

3082
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:37,840
phrasing

3083
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:41,199
be as concise as possible

3084
01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:45,839
but make sure that it's still understood

3085
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:53,360
we know that it's targeting the telco

3086
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:55,440
sector in luxembourg and we know that we

3087
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,199
have a malware sample so that's a pretty

3088
01:52:57,199 --> 01:52:57,599
nice

3089
01:52:57,599 --> 01:52:59,599
short explanation of what the event is

3090
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:01,040
about

3091
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:02,560
so once we click submit we have our

3092
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,800
event created and we already see that

3093
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,480
that our event suddenly has a lot of

3094
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:08,400
data that we didn't intentionally put in

3095
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:09,040
there yet

3096
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:11,040
so we see a bunch of tags that are

3097
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:13,360
applied to the event we see that

3098
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:15,840
the event already has information about

3099
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:16,800
uh

3100
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,639
who created the information who the

3101
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:20,000
local owners and

3102
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
information and so on so this basically

3103
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,239
takes a lot of local settings from uh

3104
01:53:24,239 --> 01:53:25,440
from the instance

3105
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,520
and it uses the event when it is created

3106
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:28,960
with these basic datasets

3107
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:31,199
a lot of these also involve the

3108
01:53:31,199 --> 01:53:33,440
contextualization that we start out with

3109
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,119
so it might seem a little bit pointless

3110
01:53:35,119 --> 01:53:36,560
to immediately

3111
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,480
label something that we have not even

3112
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,000
started working on yet

3113
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,080
but also keep in mind that very often

3114
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:43,360
what we do internally in our

3115
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:45,119
organizations is we have several missed

3116
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:46,080
instances

3117
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:49,360
that are uh that already are domain

3118
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:51,199
specific so for example we have our spam

3119
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:52,800
collector instance we have our

3120
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:56,000
our sandboxing ignis vincents and so on

3121
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,639
these these already are uh define the

3122
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:00,480
scope of the information that go into

3123
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:00,960
them

3124
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:02,880
so we can already decide okay if we if

3125
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,960
we are on our spam collector miss

3126
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:05,599
vincent

3127
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:07,280
anything that goes in there will be

3128
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:08,880
related to spam so in this case we can

3129
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:10,719
remove these tags because we don't

3130
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:12,159
we don't actually want to include those

3131
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:14,880
just yet maybe we can keep that one

3132
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:15,679
because it's still

3133
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:17,520
a draft so that means we will do an

3134
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:20,320
evaluation of this famous email accuracy

3135
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:23,599
and then um so we have some defined

3136
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:24,239
taxonomy

3137
01:54:24,239 --> 01:54:25,920
misplan on this instance we enabled for

3138
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,440
example the workflow one

3139
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:29,520
uh this one is maybe of interest from

3140
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:31,040
different organizations is

3141
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:33,280
a generic one about workflow uh what is

3142
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:35,599
the current state or other thing so

3143
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:37,920
don't forget uh in the initial event

3144
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,280
when we created the event we have

3145
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:40,560
information about

3146
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:42,960
uh the state and stuff like that now

3147
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:44,639
with this what we do is recommend to

3148
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:46,159
have taxonomies and you can you can

3149
01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:46,880
really

3150
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:49,360
set up whatever you like and in the misp

3151
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:51,440
event to define the current state of

3152
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:52,320
this event

3153
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:55,840
so we keep draft from this case

3154
01:54:57,040 --> 01:55:00,239
yeah indeed so we keep it at this and we

3155
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:01,840
scroll further down and we see that miss

3156
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:03,599
warns us about a few things first of all

3157
01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:05,119
data is not published

3158
01:55:05,119 --> 01:55:06,639
and second of all if we scroll a bit

3159
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:08,639
further down we see that mispo also

3160
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:10,239
tells us that there are no attributes in

3161
01:55:10,239 --> 01:55:11,920
here so this is still an empty envelope

3162
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:12,400
that we

3163
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,320
are about to share so list tells us

3164
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:15,520
don't share this just yet

3165
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:18,719
fill it up with data first so at this

3166
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:19,119
point

3167
01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:22,320
we can start populating the information

3168
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:26,000
so if you if you look at the

3169
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:29,840
initial document that we that we use as

3170
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:31,920
a starting point we see in there that we

3171
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:32,800
have a lot of

3172
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:35,760
information in there described we see

3173
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:37,679
for example that we are dealing with

3174
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:38,400
spearfishing

3175
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:40,320
we see that we have an email that was

3176
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:41,599
received at a certain

3177
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:44,880
point in time and we also see that

3178
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:47,199
we have an attacker that pretends to be

3179
01:55:47,199 --> 01:55:48,320
um

3180
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:51,679
working at the ceo's uh uh daughter

3181
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:54,000
and sending the email address from

3182
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,440
spoofed uh

3183
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:57,199
the email from a spoofed email address

3184
01:55:57,199 --> 01:55:59,360
so we can start by by describing this

3185
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,719
information by including this

3186
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:01,760
information

3187
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:03,280
so perhaps one of the things that we can

3188
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:04,800
take here is let's start with the most

3189
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,880
basic thing we're describing an email

3190
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:09,119
so let's start with an email object so

3191
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:10,880
we're going to add an object

3192
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:15,840
and we're going to select email

3193
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:20,639
so here we see that this is coming from

3194
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:22,480
the templating system where you can

3195
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:26,400
define uh pre different concepts with

3196
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:28,080
different fields that have to be then

3197
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:30,080
populated using this object templating

3198
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,760
system

3199
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:33,360
so we have a bunch of information that

3200
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:35,440
we can fill out here we see the spoofed

3201
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,040
address so we see a from address that we

3202
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:43,840
can encode

3203
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:50,400
okay we also have um

3204
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,880
a sample that i don't know if you if

3205
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:55,119
i've uploaded anywhere alex if not just

3206
01:56:55,119 --> 01:56:58,960
pick any file for now because

3207
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:00,880
i think that's something i forgot to do

3208
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,320
yeah i don't know where the sample is

3209
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:03,679
yeah maybe we should add it

3210
01:57:03,679 --> 01:57:06,719
yeah just put putty dot x or something

3211
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:11,840
if you have it

3212
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,119
oops

3213
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:18,159
or we can do it as a separate object we

3214
01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:19,599
can we can just do this separately yeah

3215
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:21,040
we can do a separate objective

3216
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:24,400
yeah indeed indeed okay so what we can

3217
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:25,119
already

3218
01:57:25,119 --> 01:57:27,119
describe here is we can we can still add

3219
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:28,239
the name of the

3220
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:31,840
uh attachment that we had in there

3221
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:34,159
um

3222
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:39,839
just to fast track it a bit

3223
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:42,880
good

3224
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:47,679
so we have a timestamp too which is

3225
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:49,760
interesting so um

3226
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:52,320
this one has been received as a specific

3227
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,239
so it was a third

3228
01:57:54,239 --> 01:57:56,639
of so the first scene is basically

3229
01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:58,480
something that you can you can really uh

3230
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:03,440
set up so it was the third of february

3231
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:07,199
we had a specific time if i'm misleading

3232
01:58:07,199 --> 01:58:10,159
um so in this one we have uh this one

3233
01:58:10,159 --> 01:58:11,040
has been

3234
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:14,350
sent on received on

3235
01:58:14,350 --> 01:58:16,880
[Music]

3236
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:21,840
16 so i can

3237
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:30,639
we also see that that basically

3238
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:34,159
the attachment was spoofing

3239
01:58:34,159 --> 01:58:37,199
the document uh

3240
01:58:37,199 --> 01:58:39,599
about the report about the ceo's

3241
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:40,639
daughter's

3242
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:42,719
progress in school so we can pick the

3243
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:44,080
file name for the

3244
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:47,280
uh attachment and that is under the

3245
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:50,639
attachment section in the object

3246
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:58,159
good i'm just clicking it

3247
01:58:58,159 --> 01:59:01,199
yeah it is called report.x attacks i

3248
01:59:01,199 --> 01:59:02,960
mean maybe it's not in the text right

3249
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:04,320
now okay it might not be in the text

3250
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:06,639
might be just the original file

3251
01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:12,320
about that so yeah report.x dot x

3252
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:15,360
attachment

3253
01:59:21,199 --> 01:59:22,400
and then we also know that it was

3254
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:24,879
received

3255
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:27,280
that we have received header ip so we

3256
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:28,800
can include that as well that's also in

3257
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:29,199
the

3258
01:59:29,199 --> 01:59:33,440
stated email it's 137.221

3259
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:42,960
and we even have the hostname if you

3260
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:44,639
want to include that that was also

3261
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:47,199
included in

3262
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:51,679
or in the report

3263
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:58,080
perfect so this is as you can see here

3264
01:59:58,080 --> 01:59:59,679
we did not fill everything out because

3265
01:59:59,679 --> 02:00:01,199
we don't know everything based on the

3266
02:00:01,199 --> 02:00:03,119
report but we knew some of the fields we

3267
02:00:03,119 --> 02:00:04,159
also see that

3268
02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:05,840
each of these objects basically have

3269
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:07,840
some requirements and we satisfy those

3270
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:08,639
in this case

3271
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:10,560
so if you scroll all the way to the top

3272
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:12,239
you will see that that this object had a

3273
02:00:12,239 --> 02:00:12,880
requirement

3274
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:14,560
any of those fields have to be filled

3275
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:16,000
we've definitely met that

3276
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,080
so we can just click submit and we can

3277
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:21,360
create our object in this case

3278
02:00:23,199 --> 02:00:25,360
so here we see mrs telling us if we

3279
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:26,800
create this object that's what it will

3280
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:27,520
look like

3281
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:28,880
so we have in this case created our

3282
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:30,719
object and now it is attached to the

3283
02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:31,360
event and

3284
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:33,840
suddenly stuff happened here so we see

3285
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:34,960
that each of these

3286
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:37,119
attributes already start correlating

3287
02:00:37,119 --> 02:00:38,480
with existing events

3288
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:40,800
now we read this uh this little exercise

3289
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:42,719
before we didn't correlate with some of

3290
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:44,159
those previous events

3291
02:00:44,159 --> 02:00:46,880
but normally uh if this was a real case

3292
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:50,239
if you get a correlation

3293
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:52,320
that is either something very similar

3294
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:54,400
that already happened before or is it

3295
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:56,639
something that simply

3296
02:00:56,639 --> 02:00:58,719
might be a coincidence but it's still

3297
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:00,400
close for investigation

3298
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:02,239
to check is this something that might

3299
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:04,560
help me bootstrap my investigation

3300
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:07,440
or is it just noise that is not maybe a

3301
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:08,719
side note because we have often the

3302
02:01:08,719 --> 02:01:09,280
questions

3303
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:12,560
um when you create such object in

3304
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:14,320
you see that can be cumbersome to create

3305
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:15,840
it manually

3306
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,440
so don't forget that everything that we

3307
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:20,080
do right now can be done through the api

3308
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:22,480
so you can use pymisp automatically do

3309
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:23,520
it and so on so

3310
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:26,320
what we show there um i think if you

3311
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:27,840
think on the api level

3312
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:29,599
it can be done automatically so if you

3313
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:31,119
have two that are extracting emails

3314
02:01:31,119 --> 02:01:33,119
automatically from the

3315
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:35,040
pc mailbox whatever you can

3316
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:36,560
automatically do it in mist

3317
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:37,760
we just show the complete process

3318
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:39,679
manually but you can never mix things

3319
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:41,040
for some event

3320
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:42,400
maybe some might be created

3321
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,159
automatically and then update it

3322
02:01:44,159 --> 02:01:46,639
manually and so on

3323
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:47,840
something else that might be interesting

3324
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,520
here at this point is we've encoded this

3325
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:50,960
object and we look at it

3326
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:54,560
and perhaps we we might want to

3327
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:56,880
to change the distribution settings

3328
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:58,400
based on the different data points that

3329
02:01:58,400 --> 02:01:59,280
we have in there

3330
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:02,239
so most of these such as the malicious

3331
02:02:02,239 --> 02:02:04,080
host that email is sent from

3332
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:05,760
are technical information that we can

3333
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:07,280
share with the broader community

3334
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:10,320
but perhaps the name of the

3335
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:12,400
school that our ceo's daughter attends

3336
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:13,599
is something that we don't need to share

3337
02:02:13,599 --> 02:02:15,119
with the entire community

3338
02:02:15,119 --> 02:02:17,679
so we could reduce the distribution of

3339
02:02:17,679 --> 02:02:20,000
that individual attribute in this object

3340
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,760
so that we keep that for example only

3341
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:23,520
for our own organization and for our own

3342
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:24,639
internal records

3343
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:26,000
so one of the things you can do in this

3344
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,599
case is you can edit that individual

3345
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:28,159
attribute

3346
02:02:28,159 --> 02:02:32,960
so the from address in the object

3347
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:34,800
and you can set a distribution level to

3348
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,400
your organization only

3349
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:38,560
in this case once we release the uh the

3350
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:40,480
event to a broader audience

3351
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:43,440
it will keep this individual attribute

3352
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:45,199
for an organization and it will not

3353
02:02:45,199 --> 02:02:46,000
share it out with

3354
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,599
uh with other constituencies okay

3355
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:51,280
so some other stuff that happened at

3356
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:53,040
this point we see that

3357
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:54,480
several of you are creating events so

3358
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:55,679
that's great the correlation account

3359
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:57,360
really went up all of the sudden

3360
02:02:57,360 --> 02:02:59,440
so it's good to see something else that

3361
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:00,480
happened at this point

3362
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:03,440
is uh is the event itself got correlated

3363
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:05,199
to other events as well so if you scroll

3364
02:03:05,199 --> 02:03:06,159
up all the way

3365
02:03:06,159 --> 02:03:07,599
we see that the attributes that we've

3366
02:03:07,599 --> 02:03:09,520
added are also showing us what other

3367
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:11,360
events we're correlating in so this is a

3368
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:12,159
summary of

3369
02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:13,599
all the individual attributes

3370
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:15,360
correlations from the event

3371
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:17,119
that means that if you have if this

3372
02:03:17,119 --> 02:03:18,639
object is correlating or

3373
02:03:18,639 --> 02:03:20,080
these attributes within the object are

3374
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:21,920
correlating to it with a certain event

3375
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:23,840
and certain other objects are

3376
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:25,360
correlating with other events

3377
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:27,119
then this would be a full summary of all

3378
02:03:27,119 --> 02:03:29,360
the events that you're correlating with

3379
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:31,920
you can also draw a graph out of that if

3380
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:33,199
you click on the correlation graph you

3381
02:03:33,199 --> 02:03:35,199
will see how the events are interlinked

3382
02:03:35,199 --> 02:03:37,119
and you can further explore this by

3383
02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:38,719
selecting any of the notes

3384
02:03:38,719 --> 02:03:41,520
and pressing x on that to further expand

3385
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:42,639
it with

3386
02:03:42,639 --> 02:03:46,159
with it with its own correlations

3387
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:52,079
okay let's go back to event

3388
02:03:52,239 --> 02:03:55,679
yeah i don't think we have a lot of

3389
02:03:55,679 --> 02:03:56,400
correlations

3390
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:58,400
there for the other events they're all

3391
02:03:58,400 --> 02:03:59,679
the same

3392
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:02,960
uh okay now going back to a little

3393
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:03,920
example uh

3394
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:06,320
we have now created four attributes all

3395
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:07,440
together out of

3396
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:10,320
uh of the object template but we could

3397
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:11,760
have done this differently as well what

3398
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:12,880
we could have done

3399
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:14,800
is we could also have created those

3400
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:16,480
attributes individually and added those

3401
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:17,040
to the

3402
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:20,320
uh to the um event directly

3403
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:21,920
so one of the things that we can do now

3404
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:24,320
is we can go back to our report and

3405
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:25,920
tackle the next thing that is described

3406
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:27,360
there and let's do it slightly

3407
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:28,480
differently

3408
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:31,199
so we also see that basically uh the

3409
02:04:31,199 --> 02:04:31,760
person

3410
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:34,480
uh that this is impersonated is also

3411
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:36,840
described so that is basically

3412
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:40,960
um in this case

3413
02:04:41,119 --> 02:04:43,520
john doe the teacher of the student so

3414
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:45,360
let's just create a personal object and

3415
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:47,040
describe that

3416
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:50,079
so what we can do now is instead of

3417
02:04:50,079 --> 02:04:53,520
directly describing it as an object we

3418
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:54,159
can first

3419
02:04:54,159 --> 02:04:57,520
add those different fields at least a

3420
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:58,079
name

3421
02:04:58,079 --> 02:05:00,000
as individual attributes so let's let's

3422
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,599
see how adding individual attributes

3423
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:03,280
work so we click on the little plus icon

3424
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:05,040
above the attribute list

3425
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:08,880
and we simply select category person

3426
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:11,440
and from person we select first name

3427
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:13,599
first name is john

3428
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:15,040
and here we can already define is this

3429
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:17,040
an indicator do we want to

3430
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:19,199
set the for intrusion detection system

3431
02:05:19,199 --> 02:05:21,599
flag no definitely not this in itself is

3432
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:22,880
not an indicator

3433
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:24,880
in fact we want to also disable

3434
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:26,719
correlation on this as this is a pretty

3435
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:27,679
common

3436
02:05:27,679 --> 02:05:31,840
uh name that is definitely not something

3437
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:34,719
to we don't need a comment for enough

3438
02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:36,000
but now we're going to convert it into

3439
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,800
an object anyway

3440
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:41,440
uh so what we can do is we can also

3441
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:42,880
disable correlation on this we don't

3442
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:44,159
want to correlate on john

3443
02:05:44,159 --> 02:05:47,520
okay okay doesn't matter

3444
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:51,040
actually we can do it uh

3445
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:53,360
the same thing for the last name though

3446
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:55,280
and we can basically say that this is

3447
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:57,199
now

3448
02:05:57,199 --> 02:05:58,960
last name now we've added these two

3449
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:00,400
things in there now the problem with

3450
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:01,599
this is if we just had

3451
02:06:01,599 --> 02:06:03,679
attributes instead of objects is we

3452
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:04,719
don't really see that

3453
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:06,400
john and do in this case are the first

3454
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:08,079
name and last name belong together

3455
02:06:08,079 --> 02:06:10,560
so if i were to describe several people

3456
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:12,239
in the same event you would have a list

3457
02:06:12,239 --> 02:06:13,599
of first names and a list of

3458
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:17,119
last names with no connection between

3459
02:06:17,119 --> 02:06:17,520
the

3460
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:20,400
two things so it's better to use objects

3461
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:21,920
in general whenever you're describing

3462
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:24,400
multiple aspects of the same thing

3463
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:26,159
obviously if you just have a list of

3464
02:06:26,159 --> 02:06:27,920
file hashes that you got from a feed and

3465
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:29,360
you just encode those and you don't have

3466
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:30,719
any other information with them you

3467
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:32,000
might as well just create flat

3468
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,280
attributes out of them

3469
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:34,480
because there is nothing else to

3470
02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:36,880
describe from your perspective

3471
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:38,400
but even in that case it's arguable

3472
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:39,679
whether you don't want to start an

3473
02:06:39,679 --> 02:06:40,800
object

3474
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:42,400
from the get go but what we can do in

3475
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:44,000
this case if we did start with this way

3476
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,599
or if you receive information in this

3477
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:47,520
format or your tools parse the data out

3478
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:48,719
in this format is

3479
02:06:48,719 --> 02:06:50,560
you can select those two attributes by

3480
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:51,920
clicking the little check marks next

3481
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:52,960
there are little

3482
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:54,800
tick boxes next to them and then

3483
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:56,560
clicking on group selected attributes

3484
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:58,079
into an object

3485
02:06:58,079 --> 02:06:59,920
and here miss will propose okay these

3486
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:01,599
are the different object templates that

3487
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:03,440
satisfy

3488
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:04,719
the list of attributes that you've

3489
02:07:04,719 --> 02:07:06,960
selected there's a person object that we

3490
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:07,920
can use so let's

3491
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:11,119
just pick that one for now

3492
02:07:11,599 --> 02:07:13,679
so here we see if we were to combine

3493
02:07:13,679 --> 02:07:15,199
these two things they would be merged

3494
02:07:15,199 --> 02:07:16,800
into an object

3495
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:19,199
uh that is fine with us we see first

3496
02:07:19,199 --> 02:07:20,560
name will become

3497
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:23,360
the the first name of the object last

3498
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:24,480
name the last name

3499
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:27,839
so let's merge it

3500
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:32,239
now we basically have a personality now

3501
02:07:32,239 --> 02:07:34,239
we also know that this person that we're

3502
02:07:34,239 --> 02:07:36,719
dealing with here is impersonating uh

3503
02:07:36,719 --> 02:07:38,639
the teacher of the ceo's or daughter so

3504
02:07:38,639 --> 02:07:40,560
the same person impersonated person is a

3505
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:42,400
teacher of the of the ceo's author

3506
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:44,480
so we added the object and we also see

3507
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:45,679
that there is a um

3508
02:07:45,679 --> 02:07:48,079
that we can add just another text field

3509
02:07:48,079 --> 02:07:50,239
yeah just text field works

3510
02:07:50,239 --> 02:07:53,440
where we can describe it i just want to

3511
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:54,880
first disable the correlation because

3512
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:57,599
different means

3513
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:08,239
okay

3514
02:08:08,239 --> 02:08:10,800
yeah that works and we just add a text

3515
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:12,320
description of the identity of the

3516
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:13,440
person we can just say

3517
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:22,320
teacher of the ceo's daughter

3518
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:26,000
okay now we're done we have now added

3519
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,440
the additional attribute and now now we

3520
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:28,960
know what this object is actually about

3521
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:31,119
without having a description in there

3522
02:08:31,119 --> 02:08:32,880
but we still just have an email and a

3523
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:34,960
person described in here but we don't

3524
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:36,239
know anything else we

3525
02:08:36,239 --> 02:08:37,760
don't know that this email is proofing

3526
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:39,280
to be that person so we should add a

3527
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:41,119
relationship between the two

3528
02:08:41,119 --> 02:08:43,119
now for this we can switch over to the

3529
02:08:43,119 --> 02:08:44,639
event graph view

3530
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:46,719
so that is a little bit further up this

3531
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:48,400
one allows us to create

3532
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:50,239
connected graphs out of our individual

3533
02:08:50,239 --> 02:08:52,000
data points so we see that we have

3534
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,560
two unreferenced objects so we explode

3535
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:55,280
that mode

3536
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:58,639
by pressing x and we can we can draw

3537
02:08:58,639 --> 02:09:00,719
an edge between those two nodes by

3538
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:02,639
clicking edit and add reference

3539
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:04,320
and drawing a line between the two from

3540
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:05,760
the

3541
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:08,880
email to the person

3542
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:11,119
when you do that miss will propose a

3543
02:09:11,119 --> 02:09:12,880
list of relationship

3544
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:15,040
types between these two two different

3545
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:16,480
nodes

3546
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:18,159
there is also a custom one there so if

3547
02:09:18,159 --> 02:09:19,440
you don't want to select anything from

3548
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:21,199
the list that is fine too but for now

3549
02:09:21,199 --> 02:09:24,560
we can just use the impersonates

3550
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:26,239
relationship which already exists in the

3551
02:09:26,239 --> 02:09:28,079
default library

3552
02:09:28,079 --> 02:09:31,040
just click on submit

3553
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:33,199
and now we have a relationship set

3554
02:09:33,199 --> 02:09:34,880
between those two so we started telling

3555
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:36,079
our story by basically having a

3556
02:09:36,079 --> 02:09:37,520
connected graph between the

3557
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:40,400
these two points now let's further look

3558
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:40,880
at our

3559
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:43,920
original email and see what else we can

3560
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:47,520
get out of the text from there

3561
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:49,520
we also see that the malicious file was

3562
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:51,199
contained in the email as

3563
02:09:51,199 --> 02:09:54,000
well as an attachment so let's upload an

3564
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,520
attachment now to ms

3565
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:57,199
i hope you have put in the text there or

3566
02:09:57,199 --> 02:09:58,880
something because i forgot to clearly

3567
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:01,360
i've

3568
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:05,440
so as an attachment and this is where

3569
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,280
things become a little bit tricky

3570
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:08,719
uh there's there's a quick question

3571
02:10:08,719 --> 02:10:10,159
there on the chat i'll just quickly

3572
02:10:10,159 --> 02:10:11,920
answer that then we can get back to this

3573
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:14,079
where can i create a reference if you go

3574
02:10:14,079 --> 02:10:15,679
above the attribute list there is an

3575
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:17,520
event graph button if you click on that

3576
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:18,960
you get the event graph

3577
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:20,719
and on the top left side you click on

3578
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:22,800
edit and then add reference

3579
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,239
like i can show it again nowadays oh

3580
02:10:24,239 --> 02:10:26,639
yeah that's a bit better here

3581
02:10:26,639 --> 02:10:29,280
so have this kind of gray bar there with

3582
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:30,320
even graph

3583
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:32,719
so you can basically collapse or expand

3584
02:10:32,719 --> 02:10:33,679
it

3585
02:10:33,679 --> 02:10:36,880
uh and then there you can select one of

3586
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:37,360
those

3587
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:40,480
reference objects you press x to expand

3588
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:41,040
all those

3589
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:44,639
reference objects then you can just

3590
02:10:44,639 --> 02:10:47,679
select one object that you want

3591
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:51,040
to add and then you can edit add the

3592
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:53,040
references and then you can add specific

3593
02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:54,079
references

3594
02:10:54,079 --> 02:10:55,599
in case it doesn't make sense to make a

3595
02:10:55,599 --> 02:10:56,960
second reference but that's basically

3596
02:10:56,960 --> 02:10:57,760
how you do it

3597
02:10:57,760 --> 02:10:59,280
then you select your relationship type

3598
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:01,280
and you can add your reference

3599
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:03,760
uh it's not the only way to do it

3600
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:04,480
there's a

3601
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:06,079
i would say current-based representation

3602
02:11:06,079 --> 02:11:07,199
where you can do it because we can't

3603
02:11:07,199 --> 02:11:09,119
even show it

3604
02:11:09,119 --> 02:11:11,520
so you have to go it's it's much more

3605
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:13,040
difficult to understand what happens

3606
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:16,480
yeah so so there the referendum that you

3607
02:11:16,480 --> 02:11:18,239
created through the even graph

3608
02:11:18,239 --> 02:11:20,960
is represented here so you see that this

3609
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:22,480
object

3610
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:24,400
has a reference so from email to

3611
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:25,599
impersonate

3612
02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:27,040
and here's the opposite relationship

3613
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:28,960
that you can describe the reference buy

3614
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:30,400
and you have the reference buy

3615
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:32,560
on this object so another niche mention

3616
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:33,679
is i think

3617
02:11:33,679 --> 02:11:37,840
less uh i would say 54 for

3618
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:40,000
and so on but sometimes you just when

3619
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,199
you are in the object you just want to

3620
02:11:41,199 --> 02:11:43,040
see if you have any reference or

3621
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:47,040
a sign and you can quickly see that

3622
02:11:48,639 --> 02:11:53,040
so let's add an attachment now

3623
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:54,880
and upload the sample that was uh

3624
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:56,320
included in the

3625
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:59,119
original uh email so we just click on

3626
02:11:59,119 --> 02:12:00,560
add attachment

3627
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:01,840
we select the file that you want to

3628
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:04,880
upload yeah so for the attachment uh in

3629
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:05,599
this you have

3630
02:12:05,599 --> 02:12:07,280
really two models you have the model

3631
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:08,400
that an attachment is basically

3632
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:09,679
something completely

3633
02:12:09,679 --> 02:12:12,480
uh being safe and you can basically

3634
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:13,119
share it

3635
02:12:13,119 --> 02:12:16,480
uh directly so for example you have

3636
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:17,360
attachment like

3637
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:20,400
reports and stuff in our case um

3638
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:21,920
what we want to share here it's a

3639
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:23,599
malicious number um

3640
02:12:23,599 --> 02:12:25,760
so and that's i will take i will take

3641
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:27,199
which one

3642
02:12:27,199 --> 02:12:30,559
take a sample somewhere

3643
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:34,639
um

3644
02:12:34,639 --> 02:12:36,560
press on one what we are interesting

3645
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:38,079
there

3646
02:12:38,079 --> 02:12:42,320
uh by the windows executables

3647
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:44,159
and then you have to select if the

3648
02:12:44,159 --> 02:12:45,599
sample is malicious if you don't do

3649
02:12:45,599 --> 02:12:46,800
anything

3650
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:48,239
what it will be it will be something

3651
02:12:48,239 --> 02:12:50,880
like same uh report a pdf report

3652
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:51,520
something that's

3653
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:54,079
like supporting you in contextualization

3654
02:12:54,079 --> 02:12:55,599
could be a screenshot for example things

3655
02:12:55,599 --> 02:12:56,239
like that

3656
02:12:56,239 --> 02:12:58,400
but if you share a sample you have to

3657
02:12:58,400 --> 02:12:59,280
select

3658
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:02,159
uh it's a sample because like that mist

3659
02:13:02,159 --> 02:13:03,920
will encrypt

3660
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:05,679
and hash a file so that means you have a

3661
02:13:05,679 --> 02:13:07,679
zip file encrypted with a default

3662
02:13:07,679 --> 02:13:08,719
password

3663
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:11,679
infected but i got to avoid classical

3664
02:13:11,679 --> 02:13:12,560
mistake of

3665
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:15,360
clicking on a link executing binaries on

3666
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:17,360
your analysis machines and so on and so

3667
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:18,800
on you don't want to do that so

3668
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:20,639
if it's malicious always click malware

3669
02:13:20,639 --> 02:13:22,000
samples

3670
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,440
then you have one below which will

3671
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:25,599
advance the extraction

3672
02:13:25,599 --> 02:13:27,920
uh mist can do a lot of things behind

3673
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:30,000
the scene when you receive a file in

3674
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:31,599
this case it's a window

3675
02:13:31,599 --> 02:13:34,800
of windows portable executable files so

3676
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,480
we have particular advanced extraction

3677
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:37,920
for those files and we can

3678
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:40,159
expand completely the files including

3679
02:13:40,159 --> 02:13:41,199
resources

3680
02:13:41,199 --> 02:13:44,800
code segment and stuff again

3681
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:48,000
so i will upload the files

3682
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:55,040
okay in this case this one was just like

3683
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:57,440
a very simple one

3684
02:13:57,440 --> 02:14:00,079
so in this case what do we have we have

3685
02:14:00,079 --> 02:14:01,280
an object

3686
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:04,320
with the file names the size invite and

3687
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:06,560
then the hash file so automatically miss

3688
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:08,159
will do the hashing of the different

3689
02:14:08,159 --> 02:14:08,880
files

3690
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:11,520
the sample itself is attached so you can

3691
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:12,000
basically

3692
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,880
use it and some additional ones like ssd

3693
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:16,880
for example my type are automatically

3694
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:18,880
extracted

3695
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:20,480
just maybe for the sake of it i will

3696
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:22,239
just take maybe another

3697
02:14:22,239 --> 02:14:25,360
binary just for showing you what could

3698
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:25,840
happen

3699
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:28,480
with other binaries maybe that's for

3700
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:30,000
later for different events so

3701
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,560
okay the objectives because it's easier

3702
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:33,440
to see for the

3703
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:35,360
photograph that's fine too you can show

3704
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:37,360
it afterwards yeah

3705
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:39,040
okay so now we have this again this kind

3706
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:41,040
of object attached and there's a

3707
02:14:41,040 --> 02:14:42,719
relationship to create objections

3708
02:14:42,719 --> 02:14:46,239
indeed so so in this case the

3709
02:14:46,239 --> 02:14:48,000
relationship is to the email itself so

3710
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,159
we know that the email contained

3711
02:14:50,159 --> 02:14:52,320
this file so what we can do is we can

3712
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:53,920
just create relationship between the

3713
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:54,480
email

3714
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:56,159
and the file and see that email contain

3715
02:14:56,159 --> 02:14:58,719
that file

3716
02:15:00,719 --> 02:15:02,639
do you see it it's again the same model

3717
02:15:02,639 --> 02:15:04,800
so

3718
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:09,840
contains

3719
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:18,320
there we go so now what we can do is if

3720
02:15:18,320 --> 02:15:19,840
you look further in the email we see

3721
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:21,040
that there is a bunch of other stuff

3722
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:22,480
still described so what we can do is we

3723
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:23,199
can just

3724
02:15:23,199 --> 02:15:27,599
now for exercise sake just take um

3725
02:15:27,599 --> 02:15:30,239
at least a next few lines or the next

3726
02:15:30,239 --> 02:15:30,880
paragraph

3727
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:33,199
and drop the entire paragraph into

3728
02:15:33,199 --> 02:15:35,119
something called the free text importer

3729
02:15:35,119 --> 02:15:37,119
what this will do is it will try to

3730
02:15:37,119 --> 02:15:38,320
parse this uh

3731
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:40,239
this text blob and it will try to

3732
02:15:40,239 --> 02:15:41,679
extract anything that looks like an

3733
02:15:41,679 --> 02:15:43,679
indicator out of that so this is another

3734
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:44,320
method of

3735
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:46,079
of basically entering attribute

3736
02:15:46,079 --> 02:15:49,040
synthesis so free text import

3737
02:15:49,040 --> 02:15:51,679
we just paste it in there and we just

3738
02:15:51,679 --> 02:15:54,320
hit submit

3739
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:55,760
so this will tell us in this case it

3740
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:57,679
didn't extract everything actually so we

3741
02:15:57,679 --> 02:15:59,280
need to still go back to it and refined

3742
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:00,159
a bit more

3743
02:16:00,159 --> 02:16:01,920
but it extracted some of those things

3744
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:03,119
that were in there already so that's

3745
02:16:03,119 --> 02:16:05,040
fine we can just already add those

3746
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:07,599
to the event

3747
02:16:08,239 --> 02:16:10,239
so how does it work in in behind the

3748
02:16:10,239 --> 02:16:12,480
scenes uh we have a bunch of regex

3749
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:13,520
images

3750
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:15,199
automatically extracting information

3751
02:16:15,199 --> 02:16:17,199
from from natural text

3752
02:16:17,199 --> 02:16:18,719
it's one way to do it there's another

3753
02:16:18,719 --> 02:16:20,560
tool for doing it which is part of the

3754
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:21,760
even report

3755
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:24,639
um but it's usually it's a quick way to

3756
02:16:24,639 --> 02:16:26,159
automatically extract information and to

3757
02:16:26,159 --> 02:16:28,880
see if it's already known for example

3758
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:31,199
so what we see here already is that evil

3759
02:16:31,199 --> 02:16:32,318
provider

3760
02:16:32,318 --> 02:16:35,120
was basically according to the email

3761
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:36,080
text

3762
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:38,799
and the place that was uh used to

3763
02:16:38,799 --> 02:16:40,959
download the secondary payload from

3764
02:16:40,959 --> 02:16:43,920
so we can take evil provider and we also

3765
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:44,558
know that

3766
02:16:44,558 --> 02:16:46,718
we got an ipv6 address to it so we're

3767
02:16:46,718 --> 02:16:47,920
going to add that to it as well and

3768
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:51,040
convert this into an object again

3769
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:52,879
so we're going to to just select that

3770
02:16:52,879 --> 02:16:54,879
one convert to object and the object

3771
02:16:54,879 --> 02:16:55,439
that we're

3772
02:16:55,439 --> 02:16:58,160
going to convert it to is going to be a

3773
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:01,599
url object

3774
02:17:01,599 --> 02:17:04,799
yep all the way down there perfect

3775
02:17:04,799 --> 02:17:07,120
let's just do the conversion and then we

3776
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:08,558
edit the object afterwards and we add

3777
02:17:08,558 --> 02:17:09,920
the additional information that we have

3778
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:12,318
about it

3779
02:17:12,638 --> 02:17:15,840
so we have an ipv6 that we can that it

3780
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:18,318
resolves to

3781
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:26,959
we also have a port so once we're done

3782
02:17:26,959 --> 02:17:29,839
with that

3783
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:34,639
happy destination perfect

3784
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:38,799
we can also add the port it was

3785
02:17:38,799 --> 02:17:43,840
communicating on port 443

3786
02:17:46,558 --> 02:17:48,799
and again everything i'm currently doing

3787
02:17:48,799 --> 02:17:50,240
there can be done through

3788
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:53,920
api obviously yeah and and finally we

3789
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:57,840
also have a domain evilprovider.com

3790
02:18:02,638 --> 02:18:05,840
now let's deal with with referencing the

3791
02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:08,080
this to the other objects later on we

3792
02:18:08,080 --> 02:18:09,040
can still

3793
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:11,280
still add the additional information

3794
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:12,959
that we have in there and then we do the

3795
02:18:12,959 --> 02:18:15,439
linking afterwards again we we have the

3796
02:18:15,439 --> 02:18:17,359
same problem here on this one because

3797
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:20,160
you see that the command has a the part

3798
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:21,760
it has a command so that means we can

3799
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:23,679
just convert it as an object again

3800
02:18:23,679 --> 02:18:25,359
yeah and the ip belongs to that one as

3801
02:18:25,359 --> 02:18:27,679
well by the way okay great

3802
02:18:27,679 --> 02:18:30,718
it's even better yeah exactly just my

3803
02:18:30,718 --> 02:18:31,679
screen that is a bit

3804
02:18:31,679 --> 02:18:39,840
smaller okay

3805
02:18:40,318 --> 02:18:43,920
so in this case it's again a url

3806
02:18:49,359 --> 02:18:52,718
and the things that we have this time

3807
02:18:52,718 --> 02:18:54,718
the port is actually a high port so

3808
02:18:54,718 --> 02:18:56,240
while in the other one we do not

3809
02:18:56,240 --> 02:18:58,080
correlate on on the port because port

3810
02:18:58,080 --> 02:18:59,519
443 is common

3811
02:18:59,519 --> 02:19:01,359
this is one of those ports that we might

3812
02:19:01,359 --> 02:19:03,040
want to correlate on already

3813
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:04,638
so we want we don't want to disable

3814
02:19:04,638 --> 02:19:07,839
correlation for this one

3815
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:11,679
once for the other one we we should

3816
02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:13,120
disable the correlation for the other

3817
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:15,439
part

3818
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:21,280
443

3819
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:25,280
okay now the other thing that we have at

3820
02:19:25,280 --> 02:19:27,280
this point is we have a secondary sample

3821
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:28,718
so if you can you have a second one that

3822
02:19:28,718 --> 02:19:30,718
you can upload yeah i just just add the

3823
02:19:30,718 --> 02:19:34,959
domain so i get it

3824
02:19:34,959 --> 02:19:39,280
okay so what do you want

3825
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:41,359
so we still have another file to update

3826
02:19:41,359 --> 02:19:42,478
and we have a cv

3827
02:19:42,478 --> 02:19:45,359
that was also mentioned in the okay cv

3828
02:19:45,359 --> 02:19:48,318
it's an interesting one um

3829
02:19:48,318 --> 02:19:50,560
we have we have single attributes for cd

3830
02:19:50,560 --> 02:19:51,520
but

3831
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:53,120
sometimes you want to have some more

3832
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:55,680
information so what you could do there

3833
02:19:55,680 --> 02:19:56,160
is

3834
02:19:56,160 --> 02:19:58,960
to create a simple attribute um so the

3835
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:02,720
cv is much better delivery in this case

3836
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:05,439
we have type which is vulnerability and

3837
02:20:05,439 --> 02:20:08,080
usually a venerability is defined by cv

3838
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:11,200
you can you can use other value but

3839
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:12,720
the best practice is the obviously to

3840
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:14,880
use cd

3841
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:17,120
it's very old cv those kind of attackers

3842
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:19,040
are always reusing those kind of old

3843
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:21,120
things but you know it works you know

3844
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:22,640
never people never patch i

3845
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:25,439
know this one is interesting because you

3846
02:20:25,439 --> 02:20:26,800
know it was exploited

3847
02:20:26,800 --> 02:20:29,439
so i would add the ideas flag because it

3848
02:20:29,439 --> 02:20:31,200
may be interesting to look into your

3849
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:32,160
system for

3850
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:35,040
additional ones so in this case what do

3851
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:36,399
we have we have again

3852
02:20:36,399 --> 02:20:39,439
a single attribute which is not the nice

3853
02:20:39,439 --> 02:20:41,359
thing that you want to have is basically

3854
02:20:41,359 --> 02:20:43,520
you want to have as much context as you

3855
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:44,319
want

3856
02:20:44,319 --> 02:20:47,600
for such kind of investigation luckily

3857
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:48,000
on

3858
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,040
this instance we have one of those

3859
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:53,359
expansion modules

3860
02:20:53,359 --> 02:20:58,479
and why the cv advantage is okay

3861
02:20:58,479 --> 02:21:00,560
great so and then you have some

3862
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:02,080
additional information in this case we

3863
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:03,840
have some some description

3864
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:06,960
um so what i can do in this in this one

3865
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:07,920
is

3866
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:11,359
so you see that we have either the

3867
02:21:11,359 --> 02:21:14,640
overlay uh thing so in these modules uh

3868
02:21:14,640 --> 02:21:16,319
someone was asking about extension of

3869
02:21:16,319 --> 02:21:16,960
this

3870
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:18,720
is one way you have this overlay things

3871
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:19,760
where you can basically just do

3872
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:20,640
expansions

3873
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:23,680
and see okay contextual information but

3874
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:25,120
sometimes you just want to be

3875
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:26,960
to have a bit more than just contextual

3876
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:29,190
information uh you want to have

3877
02:21:29,190 --> 02:21:31,200
[Music]

3878
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:33,920
the uh associated object then so there

3879
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:36,240
you have this this kind of

3880
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:38,160
kind of explosion there and you can add

3881
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:40,880
the enrichment i'll give a try on that

3882
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:42,080
one

3883
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:44,080
okay great so there's something wrong on

3884
02:21:44,080 --> 02:21:45,920
this machine that's great

3885
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:48,479
i'll take the other one but this this

3886
02:21:48,479 --> 02:21:49,840
it's not an object for that

3887
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:53,200
that's fine we can just like yeah can

3888
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:55,120
summon the attribute in this case

3889
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:56,399
so we have basically the description

3890
02:21:56,399 --> 02:21:58,560
then coming from the enrichment

3891
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:01,600
and what we can do is to uh

3892
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:04,240
then make an object called vulnerability

3893
02:22:04,240 --> 02:22:05,520
then

3894
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:07,920
id credit in this case is the

3895
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:09,359
descriptions

3896
02:22:09,359 --> 02:22:12,399
and make an object of it usually you

3897
02:22:12,399 --> 02:22:14,560
should have a full

3898
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:16,640
expansion there but i didn't test it on

3899
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:19,040
the training instance maybe something is

3900
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:22,560
broken on that instance okay so now what

3901
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:23,280
do we have is

3902
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:25,920
it's more contextual information we we

3903
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:27,840
start with a story and there

3904
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:29,520
we see that we have an emails we have a

3905
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:31,920
first url a second one which is a

3906
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:34,640
download and a specific cv so maybe no

3907
02:22:34,640 --> 02:22:36,240
we can go back to the uh

3908
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:38,080
we still miss one thing which was a

3909
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:39,280
secondary file that was

3910
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:42,240
downloaded oh okay from the secondary

3911
02:22:42,240 --> 02:22:43,040
files yes

3912
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:46,800
yeah so according to story what happens

3913
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:47,280
was

3914
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:50,319
uh the initial sample was uh

3915
02:22:50,319 --> 02:22:52,319
when executed was downloading a

3916
02:22:52,319 --> 02:22:54,240
secondary

3917
02:22:54,240 --> 02:22:56,560
sample and that one was basically then

3918
02:22:56,560 --> 02:22:57,680
used to

3919
02:22:57,680 --> 02:23:00,720
exfiltrate data from from the system yes

3920
02:23:00,720 --> 02:23:01,040
so

3921
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:03,520
this was a new railway download the

3922
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:05,200
interest files okay

3923
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:08,479
then i will add a yeah just another file

3924
02:23:08,479 --> 02:23:09,600
and we just

3925
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:11,600
pretend it's the one that we were

3926
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:13,200
supposed to use why is this one it makes

3927
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:14,240
sense it's an emote that's one

3928
02:23:14,240 --> 02:23:17,280
downloaded form in your eyes

3929
02:23:17,439 --> 02:23:20,160
that makes sense

3930
02:23:21,359 --> 02:23:22,960
so now we have all these different

3931
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:24,399
objects in our event and it's time to

3932
02:23:24,399 --> 02:23:25,920
build the story out of it as alex has

3933
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:27,439
mentioned so it's time to go back to our

3934
02:23:27,439 --> 02:23:33,840
event graph

3935
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:37,200
and basically uh so far the story is

3936
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:38,000
that we got

3937
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,920
an email the email was impersonating a

3938
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:42,560
person and we basically got

3939
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:44,800
a primary sample out of the that primary

3940
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:45,840
sample then reaches

3941
02:23:45,840 --> 02:23:50,399
out to evilprovider.com

3942
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:53,680
to download a secondary sample so we

3943
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:55,600
have a relationship

3944
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:59,120
between the file

3945
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:02,240
which downloads from

3946
02:24:02,319 --> 02:24:06,960
downloads from yeah perfect

3947
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:09,120
from evil provider and then evil

3948
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:10,800
provider downloads

3949
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:15,840
the secondary sample

3950
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:29,840
which is in this case index dot html one

3951
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:36,399
and this one then exfiltrates to the

3952
02:24:36,399 --> 02:24:43,840
another evil provider url

3953
02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:53,520
now there's one thing we missed in the

3954
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:55,600
story here is that the first one try so

3955
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:57,040
in this case trilogy

3956
02:24:57,040 --> 02:25:00,160
was actually abusing the cve that uh

3957
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:03,040
that alex has already expanded so we

3958
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:04,399
have an abuser's

3959
02:25:04,399 --> 02:25:08,560
relationship from trilogothexa to

3960
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:11,840
vulnerability

3961
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:15,760
so and once we're done with this we

3962
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:17,359
already see the entire store in this car

3963
02:25:17,359 --> 02:25:19,439
so even if you if you have no idea about

3964
02:25:19,439 --> 02:25:20,800
what happened in the report and you

3965
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:22,800
don't read the original report

3966
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:24,319
by just looking at this graph you can

3967
02:25:24,319 --> 02:25:26,479
clearly read it out

3968
02:25:26,479 --> 02:25:29,520
in in in simple sentences we see email

3969
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:31,520
in person later first and john

3970
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:34,960
email contains trilogy exploits

3971
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:36,160
vulnerability

3972
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:39,160
downloads from evoprovider.com

3973
02:25:39,160 --> 02:25:40,319
index.html1

3974
02:25:40,319 --> 02:25:43,680
which exfiltrates to a url so it's a

3975
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:45,760
very simple story to comprehend without

3976
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:46,080
us

3977
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:48,240
knowing the original data information

3978
02:25:48,240 --> 02:25:50,000
and without us having even having to

3979
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:50,319
look

3980
02:25:50,319 --> 02:25:52,000
at the individual indicators further

3981
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:53,359
below

3982
02:25:53,359 --> 02:25:55,760
so this is when we're talking about

3983
02:25:55,760 --> 02:25:56,800
information sharing

3984
02:25:56,800 --> 02:25:59,040
we're basically sharing on two layers

3985
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:00,479
one of the layers is sharing with

3986
02:26:00,479 --> 02:26:02,640
machines so informing an ids about

3987
02:26:02,640 --> 02:26:04,080
things to alert on

3988
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:05,600
and at the same time we're sharing with

3989
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:07,280
analysts that want to really understand

3990
02:26:07,280 --> 02:26:09,040
what the introductory was doing in this

3991
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:09,600
case

3992
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:11,760
and what happened during the incident

3993
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:13,120
however at this stage

3994
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:15,600
we have described our event but we're

3995
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:17,520
still missing something at this point

3996
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:20,479
we still haven't actually contextualized

3997
02:26:20,479 --> 02:26:21,760
the information with everything else

3998
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:23,040
that we know about it

3999
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:26,160
so we have we have vocabularies at our

4000
02:26:26,160 --> 02:26:27,040
disposal

4001
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:28,880
we have at the attack matrix at our

4002
02:26:28,880 --> 02:26:30,399
disposal so let's

4003
02:26:30,399 --> 02:26:31,680
start going through the individual

4004
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:33,760
attributes and let's start to attach

4005
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:34,560
those different

4006
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:37,520
labels to the data so first of all if we

4007
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:38,080
look at

4008
02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:41,120
uh perhaps which one which one should we

4009
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:42,319
start with

4010
02:26:42,319 --> 02:26:44,080
let's not do everything let's look at

4011
02:26:44,080 --> 02:26:45,760
the original email for example

4012
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:47,520
we know that the original email deals

4013
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:49,120
with fishing now

4014
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:51,120
attack has a pattern that describes

4015
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:52,720
fishing so we can just attach

4016
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:55,760
the galaxy cluster of attack to

4017
02:26:55,760 --> 02:26:59,280
and to the attributes in there so

4018
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:02,960
we use cluster yeah and we can just use

4019
02:27:02,960 --> 02:27:04,800
the text

4020
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:07,760
magic perfect and we can click on attack

4021
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:08,319
pattern

4022
02:27:08,319 --> 02:27:11,200
then we get the attack matrix and here

4023
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:12,080
we can select

4024
02:27:12,080 --> 02:27:16,290
uh phishing it should be in

4025
02:27:16,290 --> 02:27:19,120
[Music]

4026
02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:20,880
you see yeah there it is perfect so we

4027
02:27:20,880 --> 02:27:23,358
attach it

4028
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:26,319
we refresh and there we see it is now

4029
02:27:26,319 --> 02:27:27,359
attached to the

4030
02:27:27,359 --> 02:27:30,000
attribute and if we if we generate a

4031
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:31,680
heat pack now out of the events if we

4032
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:32,880
scroll up

4033
02:27:32,880 --> 02:27:35,680
we have an attack matrix view next to

4034
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:37,040
the event graph

4035
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:39,520
if we click on that one now we now see

4036
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:40,399
that

4037
02:27:40,399 --> 02:27:43,200
as a first overview already we know

4038
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:44,000
without looking

4039
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:45,520
at any of the details we see that we're

4040
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:47,359
dealing with positioning here so this is

4041
02:27:47,359 --> 02:27:48,800
one of the attack patterns that we've

4042
02:27:48,800 --> 02:27:49,600
described

4043
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:50,880
let's see what other attack patterns

4044
02:27:50,880 --> 02:27:52,399
from attack we can describe you also see

4045
02:27:52,399 --> 02:27:53,920
that there is automated

4046
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:55,600
exfiltration happening so if we go to

4047
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:57,520
the secondary url

4048
02:27:57,520 --> 02:28:01,840
so another evilprovider.com

4049
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:05,520
we can attach the pattern there as well

4050
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:06,960
now we can choose to do

4051
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:08,560
a single attribute what we're doing or

4052
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:10,160
we can just select all four and attach

4053
02:28:10,160 --> 02:28:11,760
the cluster tool for let's just do one

4054
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:12,000
for

4055
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:15,120
now it's it's it's enough

4056
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:19,760
uh watch out it's uh yeah perfect

4057
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:23,600
and just pick automated exfiltration

4058
02:28:23,600 --> 02:28:24,399
it's the

4059
02:28:24,399 --> 02:28:27,840
first one on the yeah

4060
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:32,000
okay so now we've attached some attack

4061
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,120
patterns uh

4062
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:35,280
we we could attach it to the sample as

4063
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:36,720
well what the sample is doing but we're

4064
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:38,479
not going to go through

4065
02:28:38,479 --> 02:28:40,479
all that effort let's look at some type

4066
02:28:40,479 --> 02:28:42,240
of contextualization

4067
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:45,680
for example maybe this

4068
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:47,120
then it's a matter of test again

4069
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:49,200
regarding the at which level you want to

4070
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:50,560
attach

4071
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:53,840
the galaxy there is the topic is a

4072
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:54,960
matter of fishing

4073
02:28:54,960 --> 02:28:57,439
at a global level usually we can add a

4074
02:28:57,439 --> 02:29:00,399
galaxy there and then for example

4075
02:29:00,399 --> 02:29:04,240
add my tray attack directly there

4076
02:29:04,240 --> 02:29:07,520
and select the pattern fishing then

4077
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:09,840
the techniques there directly so you

4078
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:11,600
have different options

4079
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:13,760
usually we recommend to make it as

4080
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:15,760
attribute level

4081
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:17,200
but in some case you don't even know

4082
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:18,880
which attribute level it applies

4083
02:29:18,880 --> 02:29:22,080
then you select the even level exactly

4084
02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:24,319
so so that's indeed a good point if you

4085
02:29:24,319 --> 02:29:25,840
know that the entire chain of what

4086
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:26,960
you're describing

4087
02:29:26,960 --> 02:29:29,680
referring to the single uh

4088
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:32,000
contextualization beta label be it a

4089
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,560
galaxy cluster then indeed what we

4090
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:36,399
assume is anything that you label on the

4091
02:29:36,399 --> 02:29:38,720
event level is inherited by all

4092
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:41,439
uh data contained in unless explicitly

4093
02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:42,399
overwritten by

4094
02:29:42,399 --> 02:29:45,760
the opposite tag basically so

4095
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:48,479
so indeed that's the case uh in this

4096
02:29:48,479 --> 02:29:49,439
case

4097
02:29:49,439 --> 02:29:51,040
we're kind of in a weird situation

4098
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:52,720
because we're describing the full chain

4099
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:54,560
of the attack which includes initial

4100
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:56,720
phishing attempt but also includes the

4101
02:29:56,720 --> 02:29:58,560
secondary payload and the exfiltration

4102
02:29:58,560 --> 02:29:59,359
and so on

4103
02:29:59,359 --> 02:30:00,960
and if we if you do this on the

4104
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:02,479
attribute level i suppose the event

4105
02:30:02,479 --> 02:30:03,040
level

4106
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:05,520
then you're really really only

4107
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:06,560
describing

4108
02:30:06,560 --> 02:30:08,479
which part deals with the fishing which

4109
02:30:08,479 --> 02:30:10,399
part deals with the actual exfiltration

4110
02:30:10,399 --> 02:30:11,040
and so on

4111
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:12,800
so this is really up to you what we

4112
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:14,640
generally recommend is

4113
02:30:14,640 --> 02:30:16,399
don't just do it on the event level so

4114
02:30:16,399 --> 02:30:18,399
if you're describing more concepts in a

4115
02:30:18,399 --> 02:30:19,439
single event

4116
02:30:19,439 --> 02:30:20,720
make sure that you contextualize

4117
02:30:20,720 --> 02:30:22,560
individual parts of it

4118
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:23,920
because one of one of the things that we

4119
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:25,840
use these labels for as well is searches

4120
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:27,359
so if i were to search for all

4121
02:30:27,359 --> 02:30:28,319
indicators

4122
02:30:28,319 --> 02:30:30,800
that relate to phishing i might not want

4123
02:30:30,800 --> 02:30:32,160
to get the secondary

4124
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:35,920
payloads effects uh included in that

4125
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:37,760
response because that was just the

4126
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:39,359
initial vector of getting into the

4127
02:30:39,359 --> 02:30:41,200
network of the victim

4128
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:42,880
whatever happens afterwards is not

4129
02:30:42,880 --> 02:30:44,720
directly related to the phishing

4130
02:30:44,720 --> 02:30:46,960
so keep that in mind as well something

4131
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:48,479
else

4132
02:30:48,479 --> 02:30:50,560
yeah so some just just something that

4133
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:52,800
you have to keep in mind too it's about

4134
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:54,640
which classification to choose or which

4135
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:56,080
contractualization source you have to

4136
02:30:56,080 --> 02:30:56,800
want to

4137
02:30:56,800 --> 02:30:59,600
to use um on this instance we have

4138
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:00,080
already

4139
02:31:00,080 --> 02:31:02,800
a lot of things enabled and if for

4140
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:04,640
example you go for taxonomy

4141
02:31:04,640 --> 02:31:06,080
you have a lot of taxonomy that is

4142
02:31:06,080 --> 02:31:08,479
describing fishing

4143
02:31:08,479 --> 02:31:10,720
for for example you have even a complete

4144
02:31:10,720 --> 02:31:11,760
taxonomy

4145
02:31:11,760 --> 02:31:14,960
about the kind of fishing you have and

4146
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:15,680
so on

4147
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:18,640
so when you install your miss pinstance

4148
02:31:18,640 --> 02:31:21,280
and you start to make it operational

4149
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:23,359
you really have to decide what kind of

4150
02:31:23,359 --> 02:31:24,800
taxonomy you want to use

4151
02:31:24,800 --> 02:31:26,720
in this case we have already a lot of

4152
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:29,920
things are available by default

4153
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:32,479
so the fishing taxonomy itself is a

4154
02:31:32,479 --> 02:31:35,200
complete one coming from a finger

4155
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:37,359
towards academic paper where we have all

4156
02:31:37,359 --> 02:31:39,840
the techniques that are used so

4157
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:41,600
for example you can say that this one is

4158
02:31:41,600 --> 02:31:44,240
coming from a

4159
02:31:44,560 --> 02:31:48,319
spearfishing which was described there

4160
02:31:48,319 --> 02:31:51,439
and you have the different techniques

4161
02:31:51,439 --> 02:31:54,000
so in this case it's email spoofing and

4162
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:55,520
you can go deeper there

4163
02:31:55,520 --> 02:31:57,760
into the description of what is exactly

4164
02:31:57,760 --> 02:31:58,720
the decision

4165
02:31:58,720 --> 02:32:01,840
and you can mix match both i mean under

4166
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:04,000
selectively attack

4167
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,479
fishing techniques at specific indicator

4168
02:32:06,479 --> 02:32:07,200
level

4169
02:32:07,200 --> 02:32:09,439
maybe another analyst would want to

4170
02:32:09,439 --> 02:32:10,560
classify it

4171
02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:12,240
and and maybe the objectives might be

4172
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:14,560
different maybe on one for example

4173
02:32:14,560 --> 02:32:16,720
it's more specific for tools but if you

4174
02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:18,720
want to run out statistics

4175
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:20,640
at the end of i don't know quite early

4176
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:22,000
meetings and say okay

4177
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:23,840
how many spearfishing that you receive

4178
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:25,600
or many emails proofing

4179
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:27,200
for example if you can control better

4180
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:29,840
emails proofing uh the spf record and so

4181
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:30,720
on you can

4182
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:32,960
just look at the current uh technique

4183
02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:34,720
that are used by by the attacker so you

4184
02:32:34,720 --> 02:32:35,600
see that

4185
02:32:35,600 --> 02:32:38,240
those kind of it's full of taxonomies

4186
02:32:38,240 --> 02:32:40,080
that are can be used

4187
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:42,800
and obviously we usually recommend to

4188
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:44,560
not enable everything but just

4189
02:32:44,560 --> 02:32:46,640
pick what you really want and some are

4190
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:47,680
very generic

4191
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:50,080
some are more advanced but that's maybe

4192
02:32:50,080 --> 02:32:51,040
something that you

4193
02:32:51,040 --> 02:32:54,560
we dig into more afterwards but

4194
02:32:54,560 --> 02:32:56,319
just be careful of which kind of

4195
02:32:56,319 --> 02:32:57,840
taxonomy you want to use because it will

4196
02:32:57,840 --> 02:32:58,800
be the language

4197
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:01,280
that you use with the community and your

4198
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:02,479
partners

4199
02:33:02,479 --> 02:33:07,840
for sharing this information

4200
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:10,880
maybe something interesting to look into

4201
02:33:10,880 --> 02:33:12,640
the email and that's linked to

4202
02:33:12,640 --> 02:33:14,479
classifications but there's this comment

4203
02:33:14,479 --> 02:33:16,000
there please

4204
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:17,840
please be mindful that this is an

4205
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:19,520
ongoing investigation and we would like

4206
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:22,000
to avoid

4207
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:23,920
informing the attacker or the detection

4208
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:25,439
and can we ask you to

4209
02:33:25,439 --> 02:33:28,479
to only use the content information

4210
02:33:28,479 --> 02:33:32,319
to to protect your constituents so

4211
02:33:32,319 --> 02:33:34,000
this is kind of that you are language

4212
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:35,520
describing to you what kind of

4213
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:37,600
classification it is

4214
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:40,640
um and so no

4215
02:33:40,640 --> 02:33:44,479
which one should we use so um if we are

4216
02:33:44,479 --> 02:33:46,800
first members if we are using the first

4217
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:48,640
community obviously the classification

4218
02:33:48,640 --> 02:33:50,160
that we will use

4219
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:52,399
is not the nato one or the ministry of

4220
02:33:52,399 --> 02:33:53,600
defense in whatever

4221
02:33:53,600 --> 02:33:57,920
country it's really tlp so then again

4222
02:33:57,920 --> 02:34:01,840
based on that we will look into

4223
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:05,920
different taxonomy that we have

4224
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:09,200
we can look for for tlp

4225
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:12,720
and i should not do that like that

4226
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:15,280
i go for the tlp library and then i have

4227
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:17,040
the

4228
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:21,120
specific taxonomy tlp and then you have

4229
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:22,240
the different one

4230
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:24,560
in this case they say you have to share

4231
02:34:24,560 --> 02:34:27,280
it with your confusion only so

4232
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:29,840
tlp amber seems to be the most

4233
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:30,800
appropriate

4234
02:34:30,800 --> 02:34:33,280
one we say that the lpm bill information

4235
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:34,880
is given to organization

4236
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:36,399
sharing limited within organization to

4237
02:34:36,399 --> 02:34:38,000
basically act upon

4238
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,640
if we have the extended classifications

4239
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:41,439
from first

4240
02:34:41,439 --> 02:34:44,479
it includes the constituent

4241
02:34:44,479 --> 02:34:47,200
too so i will just use a tmp but i

4242
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:48,560
mentioned something else that is

4243
02:34:48,560 --> 02:34:50,160
interesting

4244
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:52,960
in the email they mentioned that this is

4245
02:34:52,960 --> 02:34:53,600
an ongoing

4246
02:34:53,600 --> 02:34:57,200
association to avoid

4247
02:34:57,200 --> 02:35:00,479
informing the attacker in this case

4248
02:35:00,479 --> 02:35:02,479
or would you inform the attacker but if

4249
02:35:02,479 --> 02:35:03,760
you do actions

4250
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:06,080
on specific indicators and attributes

4251
02:35:06,080 --> 02:35:08,080
you might want to restrict that

4252
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:10,240
so there is a another classification i

4253
02:35:10,240 --> 02:35:13,200
don't know if this one is enabled

4254
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:16,399
it's called pap which is exactly that

4255
02:35:16,399 --> 02:35:19,840
it's similar to tlp but describing

4256
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:22,560
what you can do with this information if

4257
02:35:22,560 --> 02:35:24,160
we don't want to

4258
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:26,800
at least notify the attacker that we are

4259
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:27,439
doing some

4260
02:35:27,439 --> 02:35:29,680
further investigations maybe we want to

4261
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:31,040
restrict that

4262
02:35:31,040 --> 02:35:34,000
and the prp is really telling you what

4263
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,840
are the permissive action that you can

4264
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:37,200
do

4265
02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:40,240
in our case for example

4266
02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:42,479
non-detectable actions only and that's

4267
02:35:42,479 --> 02:35:43,520
really what he wants

4268
02:35:43,520 --> 02:35:46,399
because the supporters say okay we have

4269
02:35:46,399 --> 02:35:48,240
an ongoing investigation so you don't

4270
02:35:48,240 --> 02:35:49,520
want to be here

4271
02:35:49,520 --> 02:35:51,600
um other parties are informed so in this

4272
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:53,120
case i will use

4273
02:35:53,120 --> 02:35:56,800
red and again this is used at even level

4274
02:35:56,800 --> 02:35:58,800
and that's something quite important

4275
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:00,479
because myth will take care of that

4276
02:36:00,479 --> 02:36:02,720
um you don't need to set pp rate on

4277
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:04,640
every single attribute

4278
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:07,920
behind it's really at even level so it's

4279
02:36:07,920 --> 02:36:09,280
automatically

4280
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:12,240
irritating on all attributes we don't

4281
02:36:12,240 --> 02:36:14,000
show it on the interface

4282
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
because it will be two clamps to you

4283
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,240
know overload it with information

4284
02:36:18,240 --> 02:36:21,600
but we do it in a way that's on the api

4285
02:36:21,600 --> 02:36:23,280
level if you do section of search for

4286
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:26,000
example on even level or attribute level

4287
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,319
pip red will be included there if you

4288
02:36:28,319 --> 02:36:30,319
have an attribute

4289
02:36:30,319 --> 02:36:32,319
containing some information

4290
02:36:32,319 --> 02:36:34,800
automatically tags like papers will be

4291
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:38,560
then included into the information so

4292
02:36:38,560 --> 02:36:40,000
that's something to keep in mind when we

4293
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:41,840
have information from third party

4294
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:43,359
is to to wonder okay what is a

4295
02:36:43,359 --> 02:36:45,439
classification scheme so sometimes they

4296
02:36:45,439 --> 02:36:46,560
don't say

4297
02:36:46,560 --> 02:36:48,399
a specific classification to use that

4298
02:36:48,399 --> 02:36:50,479
you just use natural language or

4299
02:36:50,479 --> 02:36:53,439
just a normal sentence to describe all

4300
02:36:53,439 --> 02:36:56,160
the information should be shared

4301
02:36:56,160 --> 02:36:57,760
so the interesting thing here is that

4302
02:36:57,760 --> 02:36:59,200
what we've seen now is we've

4303
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:00,800
contextualized information in many

4304
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:02,399
different aspects and this is just

4305
02:37:02,399 --> 02:37:05,520
scraping the uh

4306
02:37:05,520 --> 02:37:08,160
the top layer basically we could go much

4307
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:09,760
much further with contextualization

4308
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:11,680
imagine for example describing

4309
02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:13,359
how this information is relevant to

4310
02:37:13,359 --> 02:37:15,120
whether it's used what sort of

4311
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:16,240
mechanisms they should

4312
02:37:16,240 --> 02:37:17,920
have in place to be able to block this

4313
02:37:17,920 --> 02:37:19,760
information how can you make this useful

4314
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:20,880
think of different maturity

4315
02:37:20,880 --> 02:37:22,160
organizations as well when you're

4316
02:37:22,160 --> 02:37:23,680
sharing information

4317
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:25,280
you could also describe information

4318
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:26,640
about who's behind it what the

4319
02:37:26,640 --> 02:37:27,840
motivations are

4320
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:29,920
so we did not describe the threat actor

4321
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:31,760
because we we haven't done any analysis

4322
02:37:31,760 --> 02:37:33,359
yet this is the initial information we

4323
02:37:33,359 --> 02:37:34,319
got from

4324
02:37:34,319 --> 02:37:36,640
a cser that just reported an incident to

4325
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:38,960
us but we could go further and we

4326
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:41,040
if we did our analysis we would find

4327
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:42,800
who's behind this we could go for it

4328
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:44,960
for uh for information with threat actor

4329
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:47,120
we could look at target sectors

4330
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:49,280
we could look at a lot of different

4331
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:51,600
information in regards to

4332
02:37:51,600 --> 02:37:52,960
to further contextualizing the

4333
02:37:52,960 --> 02:37:55,438
information

4334
02:37:58,240 --> 02:37:59,600
so in this case we could also for

4335
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:01,439
example say that's in the truth where

4336
02:38:01,439 --> 02:38:02,479
because we we know that this is

4337
02:38:02,479 --> 02:38:03,680
something that was targeting an

4338
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:05,120
organization luxembourg

4339
02:38:05,120 --> 02:38:07,760
we know it was there is also a sector uh

4340
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:08,720
taxonomy

4341
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:11,359
that you can use so that's not a galaxy

4342
02:38:11,359 --> 02:38:12,640
but the taxonomy

4343
02:38:12,640 --> 02:38:14,720
so we can also add uh for example

4344
02:38:14,720 --> 02:38:16,399
information about the financial sector

4345
02:38:16,399 --> 02:38:17,439
we know the ceo

4346
02:38:17,439 --> 02:38:20,080
is a ceo financial sector organization

4347
02:38:20,080 --> 02:38:21,600
so we could also say that it's

4348
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:23,760
it probably has to do with that as well

4349
02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:25,120
maybe it's not enabled

4350
02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:29,840
sorry about that yeah this is

4351
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:33,840
exactly there if you just search for

4352
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:35,200
sector it should be there

4353
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:37,680
yeah but i'm i'm yeah there's something

4354
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:38,319
that you can do

4355
02:38:38,319 --> 02:38:41,600
talk about about later but it's uh

4356
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:46,080
just a sector so we have different one

4357
02:38:46,080 --> 02:38:48,160
you did find that so if you there was

4358
02:38:48,160 --> 02:38:49,680
one for finance you can just pick that

4359
02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:51,840
yeah

4360
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:54,880
something else you can you can do and

4361
02:38:54,880 --> 02:38:57,520
this one is important too it's it's

4362
02:38:57,520 --> 02:38:59,040
going a bit further than the email so

4363
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:01,280
for example as a source we receive

4364
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:02,560
emails from various people

4365
02:39:02,560 --> 02:39:04,080
i mean if i receive an email from i

4366
02:39:04,080 --> 02:39:05,359
don't know from an analyst from i don't

4367
02:39:05,359 --> 02:39:05,920
know

4368
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:08,720
he set mcafee and found that i'm working

4369
02:39:08,720 --> 02:39:10,479
with them for years

4370
02:39:10,479 --> 02:39:12,720
my confidence on this information is

4371
02:39:12,720 --> 02:39:13,680
quite high

4372
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:16,080
on the other hand if i receive an email

4373
02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:17,600
from someone unknown

4374
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:19,040
maybe my confidence will be a bit

4375
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:20,880
different so

4376
02:39:20,880 --> 02:39:22,479
in myths you have plenty of taxonomies

4377
02:39:22,479 --> 02:39:24,479
to express confidence

4378
02:39:24,479 --> 02:39:26,240
for example the one that is actively

4379
02:39:26,240 --> 02:39:28,800
used for empowering the military

4380
02:39:28,800 --> 02:39:32,000
network is scale or nato scale

4381
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,800
where you can basically define the

4382
02:39:34,800 --> 02:39:35,920
credibility of the

4383
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:37,439
of the source in this case we can say

4384
02:39:37,439 --> 02:39:39,600
that we are we know the source and is

4385
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:40,640
usually really

4386
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:43,040
reliable so that's the source itself and

4387
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:45,359
we can say for this specific information

4388
02:39:45,359 --> 02:39:46,080
that is

4389
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:49,280
um probably true

4390
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:51,040
because they send us some evidence now

4391
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:53,439
if i have like three emails taking about

4392
02:39:53,439 --> 02:39:53,760
this

4393
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:57,840
talking about the same case maybe my

4394
02:39:57,840 --> 02:39:59,760
level of credibility will increase

4395
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:01,120
because we have multiple people that

4396
02:40:01,120 --> 02:40:03,359
have seen exactly the same kind of thing

4397
02:40:03,359 --> 02:40:04,640
so in this case i will have those kind

4398
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:07,120
of information there again it's it's a

4399
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:07,920
way to

4400
02:40:07,920 --> 02:40:10,000
really contextualize information and the

4401
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,640
quality of the information

4402
02:40:12,640 --> 02:40:15,760
and you have for example

4403
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:17,600
additional one like for example we have

4404
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:19,760
one called estimative language

4405
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:22,720
so this one is more coming from dna and

4406
02:40:22,720 --> 02:40:23,520
the cias

4407
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:25,600
it's like the likelihood of probability

4408
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:27,439
that this happen

4409
02:40:27,439 --> 02:40:28,960
so we can say that this one has been

4410
02:40:28,960 --> 02:40:30,720
almost certain and then we can even

4411
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:31,600
qualify

4412
02:40:31,600 --> 02:40:34,640
or own an analytic judgment on this

4413
02:40:34,640 --> 02:40:36,880
and i can say that it was like quickly

4414
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:37,680
done and it's

4415
02:40:37,680 --> 02:40:39,920
not perfect i will just say low for

4416
02:40:39,920 --> 02:40:40,880
example

4417
02:40:40,880 --> 02:40:42,319
so then you can have this kind of

4418
02:40:42,319 --> 02:40:43,920
information and you can

4419
02:40:43,920 --> 02:40:46,319
either use it as an even level again or

4420
02:40:46,319 --> 02:40:48,160
a specific review so for example if one

4421
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:50,000
of the emails it was like

4422
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,240
not properly collected or it was skirts

4423
02:40:52,240 --> 02:40:54,160
or someone modified leather and so on

4424
02:40:54,160 --> 02:40:55,840
maybe you can reduce

4425
02:40:55,840 --> 02:40:58,960
the summative language of the confidence

4426
02:40:58,960 --> 02:41:00,000
level that you have

4427
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
in the analytic judgment of the specific

4428
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:03,359
evidence or element

4429
02:41:03,359 --> 02:41:06,080
by tagging that at attribute level so

4430
02:41:06,080 --> 02:41:06,960
again

4431
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:08,240
those kind of information that we are

4432
02:41:08,240 --> 02:41:10,000
putting there are factors and so on are

4433
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:10,640
more like

4434
02:41:10,640 --> 02:41:12,800
even level but if you have really

4435
02:41:12,800 --> 02:41:15,200
specific things that need to be changed

4436
02:41:15,200 --> 02:41:17,279
or that are specific to the attribute or

4437
02:41:17,279 --> 02:41:19,439
object then you can

4438
02:41:19,439 --> 02:41:24,240
change it in the at the absolute level

4439
02:41:26,080 --> 02:41:27,520
just some other thing on the user

4440
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:29,200
interface that might be useful too that

4441
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:31,120
we skipped

4442
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:33,520
on the metadata of the event you have

4443
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:35,840
plenty of information there

4444
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:37,359
why that is interesting regarding

4445
02:41:37,359 --> 02:41:39,359
organization only and distribution

4446
02:41:39,359 --> 02:41:40,960
in this case we just distribute to the

4447
02:41:40,960 --> 02:41:42,399
organization but

4448
02:41:42,399 --> 02:41:44,240
if you have pretty large even at some

4449
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:45,920
point in time and you want to distribute

4450
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:47,760
you have this kind of overview there

4451
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:49,359
which is helping you to

4452
02:41:49,359 --> 02:41:51,040
see at which level you share this

4453
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:53,359
information in this case it's super easy

4454
02:41:53,359 --> 02:41:55,200
we just distribute it to the training

4455
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:56,960
organization that's fine

4456
02:41:56,960 --> 02:41:58,960
but if you have a pretty large instance

4457
02:41:58,960 --> 02:42:00,880
with a lot of organization and so on

4458
02:42:00,880 --> 02:42:02,960
it will display you a full graph of

4459
02:42:02,960 --> 02:42:04,720
where the information will flow

4460
02:42:04,720 --> 02:42:07,760
and will be distributed

4461
02:42:08,479 --> 02:42:11,439
okay now going back to our event uh

4462
02:42:11,439 --> 02:42:12,240
basically

4463
02:42:12,240 --> 02:42:13,840
the reason why we went so deeply into

4464
02:42:13,840 --> 02:42:15,520
the contextualization part is looking at

4465
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:16,319
this event

4466
02:42:16,319 --> 02:42:20,000
we can already uh use this right away

4467
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:21,680
when feeding our tools when doing our

4468
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:22,640
searches

4469
02:42:22,640 --> 02:42:24,160
to basically search for anything

4470
02:42:24,160 --> 02:42:25,760
targeting the financial sector for

4471
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:26,479
example

4472
02:42:26,479 --> 02:42:29,439
we can search for anything related to

4473
02:42:29,439 --> 02:42:30,160
phishing

4474
02:42:30,160 --> 02:42:33,359
and find the data contained in this

4475
02:42:33,359 --> 02:42:35,120
particular event so this already helps

4476
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:37,600
us with our filtering mechanisms

4477
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:41,040
as for pap and tlp those

4478
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:42,960
tags we can use when we make decisions

4479
02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:45,120
on which tools we feed

4480
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:47,439
the data to or which partners we share

4481
02:42:47,439 --> 02:42:49,279
the information within the case of tlp

4482
02:42:49,279 --> 02:42:49,840
so

4483
02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:51,200
we're going to see that more tomorrow

4484
02:42:51,200 --> 02:42:52,720
when we're creating synchronization

4485
02:42:52,720 --> 02:42:54,319
links with other instances

4486
02:42:54,319 --> 02:42:57,279
we can for example set restrictions on

4487
02:42:57,279 --> 02:42:57,920
tlp

4488
02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:00,080
when we're pushing data to another node

4489
02:43:00,080 --> 02:43:01,600
and we can say okay

4490
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:04,160
no matter what distribution setting

4491
02:43:04,160 --> 02:43:06,000
don't send anything tlp amber in this

4492
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:07,520
direction for example

4493
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:09,439
yeah as an example as an example there's

4494
02:43:09,439 --> 02:43:11,279
a very good open source tool um called

4495
02:43:11,279 --> 02:43:12,399
the hive

4496
02:43:12,399 --> 02:43:15,520
for serending and they use pap to

4497
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:17,120
know which kind of actions they can do

4498
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:19,120
on the data so if you synchronize them

4499
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:22,560
with the hive instance you can

4500
02:43:22,560 --> 02:43:25,680
really be sure that what you set

4501
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:28,319
as pep for example red on the lisp

4502
02:43:28,319 --> 02:43:29,120
instance

4503
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:30,960
will not generate issues when you are

4504
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:33,120
starting to expansion within

4505
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:35,439
cortex on the ice to be sure that the

4506
02:43:35,439 --> 02:43:37,359
information is not basically flowing

4507
02:43:37,359 --> 02:43:40,560
somewhere else so at this point

4508
02:43:40,560 --> 02:43:42,880
something that we didn't do so far is we

4509
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:43,840
did not include the

4510
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:45,840
on the initial email so what we're going

4511
02:43:45,840 --> 02:43:47,680
to do now is we're going to use another

4512
02:43:47,680 --> 02:43:48,960
functionality of this that we haven't

4513
02:43:48,960 --> 02:43:51,200
talked much about called the report

4514
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:54,080
the event report we can also include

4515
02:43:54,080 --> 02:43:55,760
clear text

4516
02:43:55,760 --> 02:43:58,640
information such as a report description

4517
02:43:58,640 --> 02:44:00,399
and so on together with the event

4518
02:44:00,399 --> 02:44:01,600
so what we're going to do now is

4519
02:44:01,600 --> 02:44:03,439
something very simple we're not going to

4520
02:44:03,439 --> 02:44:05,200
write our own report we have a report

4521
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:06,720
already available from the original

4522
02:44:06,720 --> 02:44:07,439
source

4523
02:44:07,439 --> 02:44:09,120
so we're just going to paste that entire

4524
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:11,439
email

4525
02:44:14,399 --> 02:44:19,840
okay just submit for now

4526
02:44:21,580 --> 02:44:24,770
[Music]

4527
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:29,920
so now if you look at our email

4528
02:44:30,319 --> 02:44:31,920
report we just have a simple report

4529
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:34,000
during gear text we're going to see an

4530
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:35,359
example what you can do with this so

4531
02:44:35,359 --> 02:44:36,880
this is all in markdown

4532
02:44:36,880 --> 02:44:39,359
so you could go into edit mode and

4533
02:44:39,359 --> 02:44:41,439
pretty it up add additional information

4534
02:44:41,439 --> 02:44:41,920
there

4535
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:43,600
we're not going to do that now because

4536
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:45,040
we're going to just look at an example

4537
02:44:45,040 --> 02:44:46,000
that already has that

4538
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,920
but before we do that let's get back to

4539
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:49,520
our event and let's assume that we're

4540
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:51,279
done with it with this entire process we

4541
02:44:51,279 --> 02:44:51,680
have our

4542
02:44:51,680 --> 02:44:53,520
report we have our event we have

4543
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:54,800
contextualized all

4544
02:44:54,800 --> 02:44:56,560
our data and let's publish it now to the

4545
02:44:56,560 --> 02:44:57,920
community

4546
02:44:57,920 --> 02:44:59,840
so when it comes to publishing we have

4547
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:01,520
different uh

4548
02:45:01,520 --> 02:45:05,120
uh ways of achieving that ms by default

4549
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:06,720
when we create an event like this at

4550
02:45:06,720 --> 02:45:08,640
this stage we have all the data

4551
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:10,160
contained that we want to share out and

4552
02:45:10,160 --> 02:45:11,439
that we want to use

4553
02:45:11,439 --> 02:45:13,520
however misconsiders this to be

4554
02:45:13,520 --> 02:45:14,640
non-final

4555
02:45:14,640 --> 02:45:17,279
it is not to be used by automation tools

4556
02:45:17,279 --> 02:45:19,359
connected to this

4557
02:45:19,359 --> 02:45:20,960
it is not going to be synchronized out

4558
02:45:20,960 --> 02:45:22,479
to other instances

4559
02:45:22,479 --> 02:45:25,760
and uh and so on

4560
02:45:25,760 --> 02:45:28,960
what we can do now is first of all

4561
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:31,279
we need to decide how we shared it out

4562
02:45:31,279 --> 02:45:34,319
it is the organization only for now

4563
02:45:34,319 --> 02:45:35,840
so even if we were to publish it it

4564
02:45:35,840 --> 02:45:38,640
would still only be pushed to our own

4565
02:45:38,640 --> 02:45:40,720
tools that connect to our miss but it

4566
02:45:40,720 --> 02:45:42,240
would not be made visible to other

4567
02:45:42,240 --> 02:45:44,160
organizations but we want to change this

4568
02:45:44,160 --> 02:45:45,120
in this case

4569
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:48,000
however let's assume that uh that when

4570
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:49,520
we're an organization

4571
02:45:49,520 --> 02:45:52,399
that does not wish to reveal who we uh

4572
02:45:52,399 --> 02:45:53,840
that we were involved in

4573
02:45:53,840 --> 02:45:56,160
in this entire incident we just want to

4574
02:45:56,160 --> 02:45:58,240
entrust the third party with doing it

4575
02:45:58,240 --> 02:46:00,319
so as you see there where alex is

4576
02:46:00,319 --> 02:46:01,600
hovering we basically have several

4577
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:02,319
options here

4578
02:46:02,319 --> 02:46:03,840
we can either publish the event which

4579
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:06,560
means we initiate the entire exchange

4580
02:46:06,560 --> 02:46:08,080
with other instances if the

4581
02:46:08,080 --> 02:46:10,560
distribution allows it it will it will

4582
02:46:10,560 --> 02:46:12,160
alert everyone that we have published

4583
02:46:12,160 --> 02:46:12,720
this

4584
02:46:12,720 --> 02:46:14,800
or alternatively we can we can delegate

4585
02:46:14,800 --> 02:46:16,479
the publishing to third party and stay

4586
02:46:16,479 --> 02:46:18,160
anonymous ourselves so let's do that

4587
02:46:18,160 --> 02:46:20,880
option for now

4588
02:46:20,880 --> 02:46:22,160
so what we're doing now is we're

4589
02:46:22,160 --> 02:46:24,000
entrusting a third party to take over

4590
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,479
this event for us so let's say that we

4591
02:46:26,479 --> 02:46:28,560
would entrust for example circle to take

4592
02:46:28,560 --> 02:46:30,479
over this event

4593
02:46:30,479 --> 02:46:32,399
and we tell circle that we want to share

4594
02:46:32,399 --> 02:46:34,080
this event to be shared with

4595
02:46:34,080 --> 02:46:36,840
uh the entire community so we've

4596
02:46:36,840 --> 02:46:39,840
collected

4597
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:47,359
yeah you can see this community only for

4598
02:46:47,359 --> 02:46:49,359
example or a sharing group whatever you

4599
02:46:49,359 --> 02:46:50,840
prefer

4600
02:46:50,840 --> 02:46:53,520
okay so this is again a suggestion to

4601
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:55,279
the other organization saying okay we

4602
02:46:55,279 --> 02:46:56,960
want you to share this out and we want

4603
02:46:56,960 --> 02:46:57,760
you to share this

4604
02:46:57,760 --> 02:47:00,960
to this community once we click yes

4605
02:47:00,960 --> 02:47:02,000
even though the event was your

4606
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
organizational and only visible to us

4607
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:05,439
it now becomes visible to two

4608
02:47:05,439 --> 02:47:07,680
organizations ourselves

4609
02:47:07,680 --> 02:47:08,960
and the other organization that we

4610
02:47:08,960 --> 02:47:10,720
entrust in this case circle so circle

4611
02:47:10,720 --> 02:47:12,000
would get an email

4612
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,319
saying okay there's this delegation

4613
02:47:14,319 --> 02:47:16,080
request someone wants you to take over

4614
02:47:16,080 --> 02:47:17,120
their event

4615
02:47:17,120 --> 02:47:18,399
are you willing to take it over and

4616
02:47:18,399 --> 02:47:19,920
publish it under your name this will

4617
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:21,200
look something like this with slightly

4618
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:23,120
different text we're cheating here now

4619
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:25,920
since we're doing a training we're site

4620
02:47:25,920 --> 02:47:27,600
administrators and we see both sides of

4621
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:28,479
the story

4622
02:47:28,479 --> 02:47:30,240
so we can either accept or discard this

4623
02:47:30,240 --> 02:47:31,600
request keep in mind

4624
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:33,920
if you accept such a request the event

4625
02:47:33,920 --> 02:47:35,200
becomes your event

4626
02:47:35,200 --> 02:47:38,560
a copy of it is created under your name

4627
02:47:38,560 --> 02:47:40,960
and basically you are taking

4628
02:47:40,960 --> 02:47:42,640
responsibility for the event from down

4629
02:47:42,640 --> 02:47:44,240
so also make sure that you're not

4630
02:47:44,240 --> 02:47:46,720
pushing junk under your name so in this

4631
02:47:46,720 --> 02:47:49,040
case let's just discard it

4632
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:50,800
but we could have accepted it and then

4633
02:47:50,800 --> 02:47:53,920
it would have become our event

4634
02:47:53,920 --> 02:47:57,359
okay let's go back to the event

4635
02:48:00,080 --> 02:48:03,200
okay so now the other alternative is if

4636
02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:04,720
you want to publish it under our name

4637
02:48:04,720 --> 02:48:06,240
what you would need to do is you would

4638
02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:07,840
need to raise the distribution level

4639
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:08,399
first

4640
02:48:08,399 --> 02:48:10,640
if you wanted to uh to involve any other

4641
02:48:10,640 --> 02:48:11,600
parties

4642
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:13,040
so we need to edit the event in that

4643
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:15,680
case and raise the distribution level to

4644
02:48:15,680 --> 02:48:18,240
say this community or connected

4645
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:19,439
communities let's go with connected

4646
02:48:19,439 --> 02:48:20,319
communities

4647
02:48:20,319 --> 02:48:22,640
connected communities means anyone that

4648
02:48:22,640 --> 02:48:24,640
has access to my miss pinsons

4649
02:48:24,640 --> 02:48:26,479
and all the directly interconnected

4650
02:48:26,479 --> 02:48:28,479
instances including all their members as

4651
02:48:28,479 --> 02:48:29,200
well

4652
02:48:29,200 --> 02:48:32,479
so in the case for example

4653
02:48:32,479 --> 02:48:33,920
of us publishing something like this in

4654
02:48:33,920 --> 02:48:36,240
the first instance we as circle have our

4655
02:48:36,240 --> 02:48:37,439
instance connected to it

4656
02:48:37,439 --> 02:48:39,439
so all the members of the circle

4657
02:48:39,439 --> 02:48:40,960
instance will automatically also be

4658
02:48:40,960 --> 02:48:42,800
included in the exchange here we see a

4659
02:48:42,800 --> 02:48:46,080
graph of that so we see the event would

4660
02:48:46,080 --> 02:48:47,760
be also visible to all the directly

4661
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:49,279
connected instances

4662
02:48:49,279 --> 02:48:51,120
which we only have one of which is a

4663
02:48:51,120 --> 02:48:53,040
loopback

4664
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:56,640
connection to exchange so not that

4665
02:48:56,640 --> 02:48:57,520
interesting

4666
02:48:57,520 --> 02:48:59,120
and to everyone that has access to this

4667
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:00,960
current instance

4668
02:49:00,960 --> 02:49:04,160
okay once we're done we can click

4669
02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:04,640
publish

4670
02:49:04,640 --> 02:49:08,160
and then the event gets synchronized

4671
02:49:08,640 --> 02:49:10,640
so what happens at this stage is first

4672
02:49:10,640 --> 02:49:12,000
of all the event will jump

4673
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,800
over to directly connected instances

4674
02:49:14,800 --> 02:49:16,560
miss will send out a bunch of emails to

4675
02:49:16,560 --> 02:49:18,240
everyone that subscribes to

4676
02:49:18,240 --> 02:49:20,560
publish alerts that there is a new event

4677
02:49:20,560 --> 02:49:22,960
with all the data contained within

4678
02:49:22,960 --> 02:49:25,760
it will push the event down various

4679
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:27,760
local channels to other tools

4680
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:32,479
using xeromq kafka and so on and syslog

4681
02:49:32,479 --> 02:49:34,000
so if you have any tools that are

4682
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:35,680
subscribed to these

4683
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:37,600
published feeds and they will ingest the

4684
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:38,800
data

4685
02:49:38,800 --> 02:49:40,560
and it will also make it available to

4686
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:42,479
the api and to make it available to all

4687
02:49:42,479 --> 02:49:44,000
the integration

4688
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:47,120
tools out there so if you have your

4689
02:49:47,120 --> 02:49:49,359
your scene connected to miss it will now

4690
02:49:49,359 --> 02:49:51,359
be able to fetch the data

4691
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:54,560
contained in this event so this is

4692
02:49:54,560 --> 02:49:55,200
basically

4693
02:49:55,200 --> 02:49:57,600
the publishing process however there is

4694
02:49:57,600 --> 02:49:58,319
uh

4695
02:49:58,319 --> 02:50:00,080
if at this point we noticed that okay

4696
02:50:00,080 --> 02:50:01,840
we've now shared this event out

4697
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:03,600
but we've actually made a typo in the

4698
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:06,840
title we we wanted to include

4699
02:50:06,840 --> 02:50:10,000
uh um i don't know

4700
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:13,760
a trailing period at the end of the

4701
02:50:13,760 --> 02:50:16,240
sentence

4702
02:50:19,279 --> 02:50:21,439
in the title and we edit the event what

4703
02:50:21,439 --> 02:50:23,279
happens now is there is a modification

4704
02:50:23,279 --> 02:50:24,640
to the event so even though it was

4705
02:50:24,640 --> 02:50:26,800
published it becomes unpublished again

4706
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:30,080
and it needs to be to be republished now

4707
02:50:30,080 --> 02:50:31,920
the reason why we do this is

4708
02:50:31,920 --> 02:50:33,760
uh whenever there is a change we need to

4709
02:50:33,760 --> 02:50:37,680
synchronize it out to

4710
02:50:37,680 --> 02:50:39,920
and if you have a publishing process in

4711
02:50:39,920 --> 02:50:40,720
place where

4712
02:50:40,720 --> 02:50:42,479
so only certain users have access to

4713
02:50:42,479 --> 02:50:44,160
publishing rights for example

4714
02:50:44,160 --> 02:50:45,760
then anytime your organization is

4715
02:50:45,760 --> 02:50:47,359
pushing out information

4716
02:50:47,359 --> 02:50:49,120
it can go through the irregular vetting

4717
02:50:49,120 --> 02:50:50,800
process so any change will unset the

4718
02:50:50,800 --> 02:50:52,319
publishing of the event

4719
02:50:52,319 --> 02:50:54,319
now in this case this is a very small

4720
02:50:54,319 --> 02:50:55,840
change that we've made so we don't want

4721
02:50:55,840 --> 02:50:57,520
to actually send out events to all their

4722
02:50:57,520 --> 02:50:59,920
users we don't want to spam them with

4723
02:50:59,920 --> 02:51:03,040
data that is pretty relevant for them so

4724
02:51:03,040 --> 02:51:03,920
we can publish

4725
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:05,520
do the publishing again but this time

4726
02:51:05,520 --> 02:51:09,279
using the publish no email option

4727
02:51:09,279 --> 02:51:11,040
so it will also synchronize the data it

4728
02:51:11,040 --> 02:51:12,640
will again make it available to all

4729
02:51:12,640 --> 02:51:13,439
different

4730
02:51:13,439 --> 02:51:16,319
means of ingesting the data but it will

4731
02:51:16,319 --> 02:51:19,600
not spam our users with emails

4732
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:22,160
okay so that's basically it for the

4733
02:51:22,160 --> 02:51:23,120
publishing

4734
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:24,399
and perhaps one thing that is

4735
02:51:24,399 --> 02:51:26,399
interesting and that we didn't talk much

4736
02:51:26,399 --> 02:51:27,680
about is

4737
02:51:27,680 --> 02:51:29,120
we have now raised the distribution

4738
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:30,479
level of this event to connected

4739
02:51:30,479 --> 02:51:31,520
communities

4740
02:51:31,520 --> 02:51:34,080
so the event is synchronized out but we

4741
02:51:34,080 --> 02:51:35,439
actually had an attribute if you look

4742
02:51:35,439 --> 02:51:36,399
further down

4743
02:51:36,399 --> 02:51:37,760
that's had a different distribution

4744
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:40,399
level uh so that one is actually going

4745
02:51:40,399 --> 02:51:41,840
to be removed from the synchronized

4746
02:51:41,840 --> 02:51:43,040
button

4747
02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:45,520
uh so we had one that the the

4748
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:49,279
impersonated person's email address

4749
02:51:49,359 --> 02:51:51,040
that was set to organization only so

4750
02:51:51,040 --> 02:51:52,000
whenever we're talking about

4751
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:53,120
synchronization

4752
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:54,640
that thing will in this case not

4753
02:51:54,640 --> 02:51:56,479
synchronize out so that will be redacted

4754
02:51:56,479 --> 02:51:59,039
from the event

4755
02:51:59,279 --> 02:52:02,240
okay something else that we can do at

4756
02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:03,680
this point once we have created our

4757
02:52:03,680 --> 02:52:05,520
event is we can also extract it in

4758
02:52:05,520 --> 02:52:06,960
different formats so if you click on

4759
02:52:06,960 --> 02:52:09,040
download s on the left side

4760
02:52:09,040 --> 02:52:10,399
you will see that we can basically

4761
02:52:10,399 --> 02:52:12,080
convert this automatically to a bunch of

4762
02:52:12,080 --> 02:52:13,520
different formats and extract it in

4763
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:14,800
those formats directly

4764
02:52:14,800 --> 02:52:16,560
this is also what we would be accessing

4765
02:52:16,560 --> 02:52:18,640
by the api if you were to search for

4766
02:52:18,640 --> 02:52:20,960
this event we can also mark whatever

4767
02:52:20,960 --> 02:52:23,520
response format we want just very

4768
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:25,200
briefly we won't go very deeply into

4769
02:52:25,200 --> 02:52:26,560
this these formats

4770
02:52:26,560 --> 02:52:30,000
are coming partially from our predefined

4771
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:31,600
hard-coded list of formats that we

4772
02:52:31,600 --> 02:52:33,520
support in miss

4773
02:52:33,520 --> 02:52:35,600
but some of these formats also come from

4774
02:52:35,600 --> 02:52:36,800
the different exp

4775
02:52:36,800 --> 02:52:40,000
export modules that we have so if you

4776
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:41,920
want you can either build your own

4777
02:52:41,920 --> 02:52:43,439
native modules for exporting and

4778
02:52:43,439 --> 02:52:44,800
converting data

4779
02:52:44,800 --> 02:52:47,840
or you can build modules

4780
02:52:47,840 --> 02:52:50,160
that are sitting in another tool called

4781
02:52:50,160 --> 02:52:51,279
miss modules

4782
02:52:51,279 --> 02:52:53,040
side by side with mist that will ingest

4783
02:52:53,040 --> 02:52:54,560
the data and then convert it to other

4784
02:52:54,560 --> 02:52:55,439
formats

4785
02:52:55,439 --> 02:52:58,160
so here's a pdf report that was created

4786
02:52:58,160 --> 02:53:00,000
directly out of the event

4787
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:03,439
uh and that you can just

4788
02:53:03,439 --> 02:53:05,680
share out directly from the event

4789
02:53:05,680 --> 02:53:07,040
something else that you can do

4790
02:53:07,040 --> 02:53:09,600
is uh anything that we do in misp so all

4791
02:53:09,600 --> 02:53:11,520
the process of adding attributes

4792
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:13,760
all the process of viewing data you can

4793
02:53:13,760 --> 02:53:14,720
also do uh

4794
02:53:14,720 --> 02:53:16,479
so do that in a machine partial way by

4795
02:53:16,479 --> 02:53:18,319
just spending.json at the end of any of

4796
02:53:18,319 --> 02:53:19,920
the url

4797
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:21,279
so in that case in this event we're

4798
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:23,120
going to get the json representation of

4799
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:23,680
the

4800
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:27,760
event okay

4801
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:30,000
so that's basically for creating an

4802
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,319
event

4803
02:53:33,359 --> 02:53:35,040
just maybe one thing that is interesting

4804
02:53:35,040 --> 02:53:36,720
we have a very good question from

4805
02:53:36,720 --> 02:53:40,080
martin it's a

4806
02:53:40,080 --> 02:53:43,120
quite complex one but maybe we can

4807
02:53:43,120 --> 02:53:46,240
already partially answer it

4808
02:53:46,240 --> 02:53:49,520
so when you create an event and in this

4809
02:53:49,520 --> 02:53:50,960
case a creator or

4810
02:53:50,960 --> 02:53:54,080
is the training people can contribute on

4811
02:53:54,080 --> 02:53:55,200
that one

4812
02:53:55,200 --> 02:53:57,680
but if you have an isaac and you want to

4813
02:53:57,680 --> 02:53:59,520
distribute back the information and so

4814
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:00,319
on

4815
02:54:00,319 --> 02:54:02,560
one of the options that you have is to

4816
02:54:02,560 --> 02:54:04,560
try to create extended events for

4817
02:54:04,560 --> 02:54:05,760
example out of it

4818
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:08,880
so you can um out of an event you can

4819
02:54:08,880 --> 02:54:10,399
create a new one

4820
02:54:10,399 --> 02:54:13,359
um which would be for example with

4821
02:54:13,359 --> 02:54:14,479
additional information

4822
02:54:14,479 --> 02:54:18,000
like validations uh additional things

4823
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:18,960
that you want you

4824
02:54:18,960 --> 02:54:21,520
you want to add so you have this kind of

4825
02:54:21,520 --> 02:54:22,800
extend even and you will create

4826
02:54:22,800 --> 02:54:24,160
automatically a

4827
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:27,359
new event based on that

4828
02:54:27,359 --> 02:54:33,920
um thing that is interesting there um

4829
02:54:33,920 --> 02:54:34,800
the

4830
02:54:34,800 --> 02:54:36,560
the thing is you can really create

4831
02:54:36,560 --> 02:54:38,399
something completely new

4832
02:54:38,399 --> 02:54:40,399
out of it and then see so for example

4833
02:54:40,399 --> 02:54:42,240
for this case i can say that we

4834
02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:45,359
uh we did a kind of session with

4835
02:54:45,359 --> 02:54:47,279
additional information

4836
02:54:47,279 --> 02:54:50,000
um there the distribution is your

4837
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,960
organization only

4838
02:54:53,120 --> 02:54:55,600
and i would add for example a specific

4839
02:54:55,600 --> 02:54:57,680
attribute

4840
02:54:57,680 --> 02:55:02,160
which is for example targeting data

4841
02:55:02,160 --> 02:55:05,600
and i can say target user uh the son

4842
02:55:05,600 --> 02:55:09,359
of the prime minister

4843
02:55:09,359 --> 02:55:11,439
so it may be information that you really

4844
02:55:11,439 --> 02:55:12,479
don't want to share

4845
02:55:12,479 --> 02:55:16,160
with others so this one is basically

4846
02:55:16,160 --> 02:55:18,160
a normal event with additional

4847
02:55:18,160 --> 02:55:19,200
information there

4848
02:55:19,200 --> 02:55:21,760
and it's only shared within your

4849
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:24,080
organization

4850
02:55:24,080 --> 02:55:26,240
nevertheless if you go to the original

4851
02:55:26,240 --> 02:55:27,600
event

4852
02:55:27,600 --> 02:55:29,120
you have this kind of extended view

4853
02:55:29,120 --> 02:55:31,279
there and we can have

4854
02:55:31,279 --> 02:55:35,279
what we call an extended view and not an

4855
02:55:35,279 --> 02:55:38,560
atomic view and the two information

4856
02:55:38,560 --> 02:55:41,600
so the is combined and you can see there

4857
02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:43,760
that we have one with the information

4858
02:55:43,760 --> 02:55:46,160
about the son of the prime minister

4859
02:55:46,160 --> 02:55:49,760
which is the extended event there so

4860
02:55:49,760 --> 02:55:52,479
just to answer the question of martin

4861
02:55:52,479 --> 02:55:53,200
about

4862
02:55:53,200 --> 02:55:56,560
the question about

4863
02:55:56,560 --> 02:55:58,880
adding information on existing event is

4864
02:55:58,880 --> 02:56:00,240
one way of doing it

4865
02:56:00,240 --> 02:56:03,279
so using extended event is a way to

4866
02:56:03,279 --> 02:56:05,840
qualify or extend even with additional

4867
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:07,200
information and so on

4868
02:56:07,200 --> 02:56:09,600
um it's actively used for example for

4869
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:10,479
when you have

4870
02:56:10,479 --> 02:56:12,560
two different view of the information

4871
02:56:12,560 --> 02:56:14,319
because one is distributed and another

4872
02:56:14,319 --> 02:56:15,520
one is like

4873
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:17,920
likely like the private information like

4874
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:19,120
the forensic evidence

4875
02:56:19,120 --> 02:56:21,120
that you cannot share for example you

4876
02:56:21,120 --> 02:56:22,800
can create this kind of thing

4877
02:56:22,800 --> 02:56:24,399
it's one way of doing it it's not

4878
02:56:24,399 --> 02:56:25,600
answering companies the question of

4879
02:56:25,600 --> 02:56:26,960
martin but we can

4880
02:56:26,960 --> 02:56:29,439
even go deeper later on that but it's

4881
02:56:29,439 --> 02:56:31,359
it's one way of

4882
02:56:31,359 --> 02:56:32,560
because tomorrow we talk about

4883
02:56:32,560 --> 02:56:34,560
synchronization there are some specific

4884
02:56:34,560 --> 02:56:36,000
options for isaac like

4885
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:37,920
and publishing events if we do

4886
02:56:37,920 --> 02:56:39,359
synchronization and so on

4887
02:56:39,359 --> 02:56:41,439
that can be used in some some cases for

4888
02:56:41,439 --> 02:56:43,200
isaac's

4889
02:56:43,200 --> 02:56:45,520
there are many options but that's one

4890
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:47,760
way of of partially solving

4891
02:56:47,760 --> 02:56:50,319
this kind of issues of not owning the

4892
02:56:50,319 --> 02:56:51,279
data

4893
02:56:51,279 --> 02:56:55,600
is to extend the information

4894
02:56:55,600 --> 02:56:57,359
so i know you have something you want to

4895
02:56:57,359 --> 02:56:59,200
add on rashford

4896
02:56:59,200 --> 02:57:02,640
no no that makes sense

4897
02:57:04,240 --> 02:57:07,040
again for the collaboration on this one

4898
02:57:07,040 --> 02:57:08,640
we can do various things so

4899
02:57:08,640 --> 02:57:11,279
in the case of um you have a typo for

4900
02:57:11,279 --> 02:57:13,760
example in the specifications and so on

4901
02:57:13,760 --> 02:57:15,920
you can make proposal another thing with

4902
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:17,439
uh

4903
02:57:17,439 --> 02:57:19,920
on the interface here you see that you

4904
02:57:19,920 --> 02:57:21,120
can

4905
02:57:21,120 --> 02:57:23,680
basically make either an edit or you see

4906
02:57:23,680 --> 02:57:24,880
that you can make

4907
02:57:24,880 --> 02:57:28,399
a proposed edit so what is the use case

4908
02:57:28,399 --> 02:57:28,880
of that

4909
02:57:28,880 --> 02:57:30,720
it's it's not like for fundamental

4910
02:57:30,720 --> 02:57:32,399
changes but for i would say minor

4911
02:57:32,399 --> 02:57:34,960
challenges on a specific import

4912
02:57:34,960 --> 02:57:37,120
imagine that you don't agree on this one

4913
02:57:37,120 --> 02:57:38,880
on this idea of season

4914
02:57:38,880 --> 02:57:42,720
there's a typo and it's not d5 but e5

4915
02:57:42,720 --> 02:57:46,399
in the ipv6 rs so you propose the change

4916
02:57:46,399 --> 02:57:48,640
in this case i'm playing both holes here

4917
02:57:48,640 --> 02:57:49,680
but

4918
02:57:49,680 --> 02:57:51,920
what do i have here it's basically an

4919
02:57:51,920 --> 02:57:53,120
attribute

4920
02:57:53,120 --> 02:57:55,520
with a proposal of the church and i'm

4921
02:57:55,520 --> 02:57:56,800
playing the boss roles for the

4922
02:57:56,800 --> 02:57:59,439
contributor roles and

4923
02:57:59,439 --> 02:58:02,800
the original creator then i can say okay

4924
02:58:02,800 --> 02:58:05,760
i accept the change indeed this this

4925
02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:07,680
proposal makes sense

4926
02:58:07,680 --> 02:58:10,960
or are basically discounted and this is

4927
02:58:10,960 --> 02:58:14,000
a way to get updates from

4928
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:18,000
um from supportive other members other

4929
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:19,439
organizations and so on

4930
02:58:19,439 --> 02:58:21,040
it's one way to to update the

4931
02:58:21,040 --> 02:58:22,880
information in this case i will

4932
02:58:22,880 --> 02:58:26,960
discuss it because it's not correct

4933
02:58:26,960 --> 02:58:28,880
we were talking about contributions this

4934
02:58:28,880 --> 02:58:30,880
another way of contributing is the site

4935
02:58:30,880 --> 02:58:32,080
things itself

4936
02:58:32,080 --> 02:58:35,680
so for example for this specifications

4937
02:58:35,680 --> 02:58:37,040
if for example we have an expression

4938
02:58:37,040 --> 02:58:38,399
detection system and we have seen it

4939
02:58:38,399 --> 02:58:39,040
like

4940
02:58:39,040 --> 02:58:42,720
three times in a row we can add

4941
02:58:42,720 --> 02:58:47,279
on on the interface with the api

4942
02:58:47,279 --> 02:58:48,640
through the user interface and so on

4943
02:58:48,640 --> 02:58:50,640
that you have seen that um

4944
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:53,920
multiple times and like that you can

4945
02:58:53,920 --> 02:58:55,920
share this kind of details about

4946
02:58:55,920 --> 02:58:59,200
the sharing aspect

4947
02:58:59,200 --> 02:59:01,200
so we what we have seen that at this

4948
02:59:01,200 --> 02:59:02,800
specific amount of times we have

4949
02:59:02,800 --> 02:59:05,359
the three counts saying this uh this is

4950
02:59:05,359 --> 02:59:06,240
a site

4951
02:59:06,240 --> 02:59:07,920
and you have seen it and you can do it

4952
02:59:07,920 --> 02:59:09,520
per organization

4953
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:11,840
or it could be even anonymously you get

4954
02:59:11,840 --> 02:59:13,439
different configuration in the model of

4955
02:59:13,439 --> 02:59:15,439
cycling in mist

4956
02:59:15,439 --> 02:59:18,160
but it's a way to see that an indicator

4957
02:59:18,160 --> 02:59:19,279
has been seen

4958
02:59:19,279 --> 02:59:22,800
or not if one specific are generating

4959
02:59:22,800 --> 02:59:23,680
for example a

4960
02:59:23,680 --> 02:59:25,600
false positive you can see the negative

4961
02:59:25,600 --> 02:59:28,319
one negative sightings which

4962
02:59:28,319 --> 02:59:30,960
basically tell others that okay this one

4963
02:59:30,960 --> 02:59:33,840
is generating a lot of false positives

4964
02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:35,840
sometimes not every organization agrees

4965
02:59:35,840 --> 02:59:37,200
on the first positive because they have

4966
02:59:37,200 --> 02:59:38,720
different views

4967
02:59:38,720 --> 02:59:40,800
coming from different networks and so on

4968
02:59:40,800 --> 02:59:42,800
that's a way to

4969
02:59:42,800 --> 02:59:46,319
provide feedback so one is delegations

4970
02:59:46,319 --> 02:59:49,359
proposals or another way is to

4971
02:59:49,359 --> 02:59:57,520
basically get affected

4972
02:59:57,520 --> 02:59:59,760
okay

4973
03:00:01,439 --> 03:00:02,720
i'm just trying to go through the

4974
03:00:02,720 --> 03:00:04,479
questions yeah

4975
03:00:04,479 --> 03:00:07,279
maybe yes maybe there are some yeah

4976
03:00:07,279 --> 03:00:08,479
there are some that are repeating so

4977
03:00:08,479 --> 03:00:10,560
perhaps it's good to call them out

4978
03:00:10,560 --> 03:00:12,800
uh so there was a bit of confusion about

4979
03:00:12,800 --> 03:00:13,680
how to add the

4980
03:00:13,680 --> 03:00:16,000
uh the email object so it uh checked it

4981
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:17,040
is a little bit

4982
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:19,200
uh confusing so when you're in an event

4983
03:00:19,200 --> 03:00:20,880
and you click on add objects first you

4984
03:00:20,880 --> 03:00:22,960
need to select the scope

4985
03:00:22,960 --> 03:00:24,560
from which you choose from so it's going

4986
03:00:24,560 --> 03:00:26,479
to be climate file and so on just click

4987
03:00:26,479 --> 03:00:28,560
on all objects if you're unsure

4988
03:00:28,560 --> 03:00:30,160
and then you can search for whatever so

4989
03:00:30,160 --> 03:00:31,680
after you click on all objects and you

4990
03:00:31,680 --> 03:00:32,399
type email

4991
03:00:32,399 --> 03:00:35,920
it's going to show your email object

4992
03:00:35,920 --> 03:00:38,000
here the first step is more like finding

4993
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:39,520
out the category of an object

4994
03:00:39,520 --> 03:00:41,680
yeah so so some sometimes you just know

4995
03:00:41,680 --> 03:00:43,200
the category but you don't know what is

4996
03:00:43,200 --> 03:00:44,880
really available there for you

4997
03:00:44,880 --> 03:00:46,800
so you you want to see okay what sort of

4998
03:00:46,800 --> 03:00:48,720
objects can i use in network contacts

4999
03:00:48,720 --> 03:00:50,399
and i would click on network first

5000
03:00:50,399 --> 03:00:52,800
and then you get a list of of all

5001
03:00:52,800 --> 03:00:54,160
tangently related

5002
03:00:54,160 --> 03:00:55,439
objects that will have to do with

5003
03:00:55,439 --> 03:00:57,279
network connectivity but

5004
03:00:57,279 --> 03:01:00,160
not necessarily describing the same

5005
03:01:00,160 --> 03:01:01,520
concept at all

5006
03:01:01,520 --> 03:01:04,640
uh but if you don't know or

5007
03:01:04,640 --> 03:01:06,319
which the domain you want to pick it

5008
03:01:06,319 --> 03:01:08,240
from or if you know

5009
03:01:08,240 --> 03:01:10,000
exactly already what you want and you

5010
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:11,600
just want to search by name just click

5011
03:01:11,600 --> 03:01:13,120
on all objects first

5012
03:01:13,120 --> 03:01:14,160
and then you will find what you're

5013
03:01:14,160 --> 03:01:17,680
looking for by just typing it so email

5014
03:01:17,680 --> 03:01:20,880
is easy to find that way

5015
03:01:20,880 --> 03:01:25,039
okay so just type email and that's it

5016
03:01:25,359 --> 03:01:28,640
okay um other questions

5017
03:01:28,640 --> 03:01:33,359
that were there okay perfect

5018
03:01:33,359 --> 03:01:35,920
and there there were a few other

5019
03:01:35,920 --> 03:01:37,359
questions that i answered in the

5020
03:01:37,359 --> 03:01:38,399
meanwhile maybe it's

5021
03:01:38,399 --> 03:01:41,040
a good idea to read soft about yeah

5022
03:01:41,040 --> 03:01:42,319
indeed there was a good one

5023
03:01:42,319 --> 03:01:44,240
about correlation graph and and

5024
03:01:44,240 --> 03:01:45,680
filtering on it

5025
03:01:45,680 --> 03:01:47,200
indeed we don't have a way to filter the

5026
03:01:47,200 --> 03:01:49,040
correlation graph but it's something

5027
03:01:49,040 --> 03:01:50,479
that we that we've discussed for a while

5028
03:01:50,479 --> 03:01:52,000
already and we want to do it at one

5029
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:52,399
point

5030
03:01:52,399 --> 03:01:54,080
so that you can add some filter rules in

5031
03:01:54,080 --> 03:01:56,000
there yes

5032
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:58,080
the only way to to do it here at least

5033
03:01:58,080 --> 03:01:59,760
through the api so that means you you

5034
03:01:59,760 --> 03:02:01,040
done the

5035
03:02:01,040 --> 03:02:03,840
decorating one and then you have to do a

5036
03:02:03,840 --> 03:02:04,640
filtering

5037
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:07,279
priority but it needs something that's

5038
03:02:07,279 --> 03:02:07,920
uh

5039
03:02:07,920 --> 03:02:11,279
yeah it will be to be added i don't know

5040
03:02:11,279 --> 03:02:12,720
if you have an issue on that one

5041
03:02:12,720 --> 03:02:17,040
um yeah i think we do yes yes

5042
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:19,200
so maybe you know what sometimes what we

5043
03:02:19,200 --> 03:02:21,760
do is

5044
03:02:21,840 --> 03:02:24,560
just just to add the one on this one um

5045
03:02:24,560 --> 03:02:26,160
if i'm finding his back

5046
03:02:26,160 --> 03:02:27,359
so i guess you can see what kind of

5047
03:02:27,359 --> 03:02:29,359
issue that we have and so on

5048
03:02:29,359 --> 03:02:31,040
a lot of the issue that we have is more

5049
03:02:31,040 --> 03:02:32,880
like i mean

5050
03:02:32,880 --> 03:02:34,960
around 25 percent 30 percent our basic

5051
03:02:34,960 --> 03:02:36,319
installation problem

5052
03:02:36,319 --> 03:02:38,720
um that's something that you can discuss

5053
03:02:38,720 --> 03:02:39,920
maybe tomorrow about

5054
03:02:39,920 --> 03:02:42,560
about recommendation on on on the

5055
03:02:42,560 --> 03:02:43,359
systems

5056
03:02:43,359 --> 03:02:45,200
we don't need a lot of requirements but

5057
03:02:45,200 --> 03:02:46,560
at least um

5058
03:02:46,560 --> 03:02:48,240
you need to have a lamp system working

5059
03:02:48,240 --> 03:02:49,760
for mariadb

5060
03:02:49,760 --> 03:02:52,880
linux systems and ready running

5061
03:02:52,880 --> 03:02:56,319
so obviously for example an ubuntu

5062
03:02:56,319 --> 03:02:57,760
distribution out of the box is working

5063
03:02:57,760 --> 03:02:59,439
without any problems

5064
03:02:59,439 --> 03:03:02,080
now if you try to install a missponder

5065
03:03:02,080 --> 03:03:02,800
mac os

5066
03:03:02,800 --> 03:03:05,359
you might turn into troubles obviously

5067
03:03:05,359 --> 03:03:05,920
but

5068
03:03:05,920 --> 03:03:07,920
what we recommend is we have install

5069
03:03:07,920 --> 03:03:09,840
automatic install script for

5070
03:03:09,840 --> 03:03:12,160
for ubuntu for example and this one

5071
03:03:12,160 --> 03:03:14,240
works works quite well

5072
03:03:14,240 --> 03:03:18,240
i wanted to search the issue for

5073
03:03:18,399 --> 03:03:20,080
you just search your correlation for

5074
03:03:20,080 --> 03:03:22,560
correlation yeah

5075
03:03:22,560 --> 03:03:25,840
creation filtering now that will be a

5076
03:03:25,840 --> 03:03:26,240
bit

5077
03:03:26,240 --> 03:03:29,279
too specific i think no really not

5078
03:03:29,279 --> 03:03:31,439
maybe yes we're filtering by correlation

5079
03:03:31,439 --> 03:03:40,640
on feedback

5080
03:03:40,640 --> 03:03:43,519
yeah that's easy

5081
03:03:44,720 --> 03:03:47,840
oh this one maybe yes yeah yeah okay

5082
03:03:47,840 --> 03:03:55,840
this one okay so

5083
03:04:03,200 --> 03:04:05,200
so that's how we work so if you see a

5084
03:04:05,200 --> 03:04:06,960
component issue that

5085
03:04:06,960 --> 03:04:08,560
or a feature that is really interesting

5086
03:04:08,560 --> 03:04:10,240
for you don't hesitate to take an

5087
03:04:10,240 --> 03:04:11,359
existing issue

5088
03:04:11,359 --> 03:04:13,600
about specific requests and add some

5089
03:04:13,600 --> 03:04:14,479
comments there

5090
03:04:14,479 --> 03:04:16,319
like for example it's really the issue

5091
03:04:16,319 --> 03:04:18,000
the feature that you want

5092
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:20,160
uh is it important for you why and so on

5093
03:04:20,160 --> 03:04:22,080
and then we use that as a source of

5094
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:25,200
of doing a pd request as an example we

5095
03:04:25,200 --> 03:04:26,960
do

5096
03:04:26,960 --> 03:04:29,040
a release of miss every three weeks

5097
03:04:29,040 --> 03:04:30,560
usually

5098
03:04:30,560 --> 03:04:34,560
and there are many new features on each

5099
03:04:34,560 --> 03:04:35,359
release

5100
03:04:35,359 --> 03:04:38,399
as an example we had a request like that

5101
03:04:38,399 --> 03:04:40,319
sami just fixed uh

5102
03:04:40,319 --> 03:04:43,600
two days ago about the events oh we

5103
03:04:43,600 --> 03:04:44,560
didn't even show it

5104
03:04:44,560 --> 03:04:48,640
even timeline and then

5105
03:04:48,640 --> 03:04:50,399
we wanted to have something that is easy

5106
03:04:50,399 --> 03:04:52,160
to set the number of days and then he

5107
03:04:52,160 --> 03:04:52,479
has

5108
03:04:52,479 --> 03:04:54,720
the new feature so sometimes it makes a

5109
03:04:54,720 --> 03:04:56,319
lot of sense so don't hesitate to create

5110
03:04:56,319 --> 03:04:57,040
a

5111
03:04:57,040 --> 03:05:00,080
an issue and and propose a new new

5112
03:05:00,080 --> 03:05:01,359
feature

5113
03:05:01,359 --> 03:05:05,600
which remind me of showing you the even

5114
03:05:05,600 --> 03:05:08,080
timeline because we didn't really show

5115
03:05:08,080 --> 03:05:09,520
it

5116
03:05:09,520 --> 03:05:13,359
so you see that on on this one

5117
03:05:13,359 --> 03:05:17,840
we we have nearly everything

5118
03:05:17,840 --> 03:05:20,240
same time which is basically the time

5119
03:05:20,240 --> 03:05:21,120
when we

5120
03:05:21,120 --> 03:05:24,080
create a different object we just set

5121
03:05:24,080 --> 03:05:27,760
the time for four for one

5122
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:31,439
so and then i can

5123
03:05:31,439 --> 03:05:33,120
basically look at this one and this one

5124
03:05:33,120 --> 03:05:35,120
is like the

5125
03:05:35,120 --> 03:05:37,760
yeah i don't know why we don't have the

5126
03:05:37,760 --> 03:05:40,319
expansion on that one

5127
03:05:40,319 --> 03:05:41,600
so for you for example if you have a

5128
03:05:41,600 --> 03:05:43,359
specific time we can

5129
03:05:43,359 --> 03:05:44,960
expand it and even change it in the

5130
03:05:44,960 --> 03:05:46,319
graph so that means if we have for

5131
03:05:46,319 --> 03:05:47,680
example this email

5132
03:05:47,680 --> 03:05:50,560
a thing with that we can we can expand

5133
03:05:50,560 --> 03:05:51,120
it

5134
03:05:51,120 --> 03:05:54,000
and change when when this has been seen

5135
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,240
and we can even uh

5136
03:05:56,240 --> 03:05:58,560
change at which time this specific

5137
03:05:58,560 --> 03:06:00,240
specifically

5138
03:06:00,240 --> 03:06:04,080
but that's again a good point to do

5139
03:06:04,080 --> 03:06:07,439
is to automatically create

5140
03:06:07,439 --> 03:06:10,960
a first thing last scene on your element

5141
03:06:10,960 --> 03:06:13,200
because every time you do that you will

5142
03:06:13,200 --> 03:06:14,960
get an automatic timeline

5143
03:06:14,960 --> 03:06:16,880
and actually a quick i would say quick

5144
03:06:16,880 --> 03:06:20,479
win when you do analysis

5145
03:06:21,510 --> 03:06:23,760
[Music]

5146
03:06:23,760 --> 03:06:25,439
so if there are no more questions about

5147
03:06:25,439 --> 03:06:27,120
event creation perhaps one of the things

5148
03:06:27,120 --> 03:06:28,800
we can do is show the searching

5149
03:06:28,800 --> 03:06:33,199
how to search for stuff in your risk

5150
03:06:36,399 --> 03:06:38,800
okay so this is something that we're

5151
03:06:38,800 --> 03:06:40,240
going to show very briefly now and we're

5152
03:06:40,240 --> 03:06:42,399
going to go a bit more detail into this

5153
03:06:42,399 --> 03:06:43,200
tomorrow

5154
03:06:43,200 --> 03:06:44,960
when we're also going to look at the api

5155
03:06:44,960 --> 03:06:47,040
but generally whenever you're searching

5156
03:06:47,040 --> 03:06:47,680
in miss

5157
03:06:47,680 --> 03:06:49,040
the main question you need to ask

5158
03:06:49,040 --> 03:06:50,800
yourself is

5159
03:06:50,800 --> 03:06:52,960
what scope am i searching on am i

5160
03:06:52,960 --> 03:06:54,720
searching for individual attributes

5161
03:06:54,720 --> 03:06:56,880
or am i searching for events the search

5162
03:06:56,880 --> 03:06:58,560
filters very often overlapping

5163
03:06:58,560 --> 03:07:01,279
or aren't necessarily almost the same

5164
03:07:01,279 --> 03:07:02,319
but one of the things you need to keep

5165
03:07:02,319 --> 03:07:04,080
in mind is for example if i'm searching

5166
03:07:04,080 --> 03:07:04,399
for

5167
03:07:04,399 --> 03:07:06,880
bitcoin addresses in my miss vincent's

5168
03:07:06,880 --> 03:07:09,040
bitcoin wallets

5169
03:07:09,040 --> 03:07:11,279
am i searching for any event that

5170
03:07:11,279 --> 03:07:12,640
contains at least one

5171
03:07:12,640 --> 03:07:16,000
bitcoin address or am i searching for

5172
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,240
just the bitcoin addresses themselves

5173
03:07:18,240 --> 03:07:19,920
so this is when we decide between

5174
03:07:19,920 --> 03:07:21,439
different scopes so

5175
03:07:21,439 --> 03:07:23,520
generally attribute scope will only give

5176
03:07:23,520 --> 03:07:25,200
you the individual attributes that match

5177
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:26,399
the criteria

5178
03:07:26,399 --> 03:07:27,840
and the event scope will give you

5179
03:07:27,840 --> 03:07:29,439
everything that contains

5180
03:07:29,439 --> 03:07:32,240
at least one matching value so here what

5181
03:07:32,240 --> 03:07:34,319
what alex did he just searched

5182
03:07:34,319 --> 03:07:36,640
using the attribute search for all the

5183
03:07:36,640 --> 03:07:37,760
bitcoin addresses

5184
03:07:37,760 --> 03:07:39,520
in the air in the instance and we see we

5185
03:07:39,520 --> 03:07:40,880
get a bunch of them from different

5186
03:07:40,880 --> 03:07:42,560
sources we see which events there

5187
03:07:42,560 --> 03:07:44,560
they're from which organization has

5188
03:07:44,560 --> 03:07:46,240
created that information and so on and

5189
03:07:46,240 --> 03:07:47,439
so forth

5190
03:07:47,439 --> 03:07:49,200
uh if we're happy with the search

5191
03:07:49,200 --> 03:07:51,520
results and we've set up all our

5192
03:07:51,520 --> 03:07:53,600
features and we're getting exactly what

5193
03:07:53,600 --> 03:07:55,120
we were looking for

5194
03:07:55,120 --> 03:07:57,279
maybe even several pages of it like here

5195
03:07:57,279 --> 03:07:59,120
we can download the results in any of

5196
03:07:59,120 --> 03:08:01,200
these supported formats so we could say

5197
03:08:01,200 --> 03:08:02,640
okay now we have all these bitcoin

5198
03:08:02,640 --> 03:08:04,560
addresses out there generate the csv out

5199
03:08:04,560 --> 03:08:05,279
of it

5200
03:08:05,279 --> 03:08:08,399
and it will generate a massive csv

5201
03:08:08,399 --> 03:08:10,640
with all the attribute information for

5202
03:08:10,640 --> 03:08:13,199
each of these

5203
03:08:13,840 --> 03:08:15,760
i hope you're not running my timings

5204
03:08:15,760 --> 03:08:18,560
inside of memory

5205
03:08:19,520 --> 03:08:21,760
there it is

5206
03:08:21,760 --> 03:08:23,120
[Music]

5207
03:08:23,120 --> 03:08:26,160
so if you open it just to see the

5208
03:08:26,160 --> 03:08:28,000
results quickly

5209
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:31,279
there we go so in this case uh

5210
03:08:31,279 --> 03:08:34,160
we now downloaded our search results as

5211
03:08:34,160 --> 03:08:34,960
csv

5212
03:08:34,960 --> 03:08:36,560
now keep in mind whenever you're dealing

5213
03:08:36,560 --> 03:08:39,120
with integration of mis with other tools

5214
03:08:39,120 --> 03:08:39,439
or

5215
03:08:39,439 --> 03:08:41,439
exports keep in mind that certain

5216
03:08:41,439 --> 03:08:43,680
formats don't really cater to exporting

5217
03:08:43,680 --> 03:08:45,200
certain types of data so

5218
03:08:45,200 --> 03:08:47,600
if you're searching for ransomware

5219
03:08:47,600 --> 03:08:49,439
payout

5220
03:08:49,439 --> 03:08:51,920
wallets you could for example specify as

5221
03:08:51,920 --> 03:08:52,800
a tag

5222
03:08:52,800 --> 03:08:55,120
all the different ransomware related

5223
03:08:55,120 --> 03:08:56,399
tags that you have

5224
03:08:56,399 --> 03:08:58,880
and uh as a type select btc like what

5225
03:08:58,880 --> 03:09:00,560
alex has done here and exported

5226
03:09:00,560 --> 03:09:02,240
information now when you're deciding

5227
03:09:02,240 --> 03:09:03,920
what format to download in

5228
03:09:03,920 --> 03:09:05,760
again some don't make any sense so don't

5229
03:09:05,760 --> 03:09:07,920
download bitcoin addresses in sticks

5230
03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:10,240
format because sticks doesn't have a

5231
03:09:10,240 --> 03:09:11,920
way to express bitcoin addresses for

5232
03:09:11,920 --> 03:09:13,359
example

5233
03:09:13,359 --> 03:09:15,439
so just make sure that you also take

5234
03:09:15,439 --> 03:09:17,120
that into consideration and exporting

5235
03:09:17,120 --> 03:09:19,760
data so that it's not wasting

5236
03:09:19,760 --> 03:09:22,160
uh besides that we can do the same on

5237
03:09:22,160 --> 03:09:23,680
the event level we can also do searches

5238
03:09:23,680 --> 03:09:24,560
on the event level

5239
03:09:24,560 --> 03:09:26,800
if we go back to our event index we have

5240
03:09:26,800 --> 03:09:29,040
a little magnifying glass icon where you

5241
03:09:29,040 --> 03:09:29,359
can

5242
03:09:29,359 --> 03:09:31,600
add additional filter options to the

5243
03:09:31,600 --> 03:09:32,479
index

5244
03:09:32,479 --> 03:09:34,720
and filter the database on that so let's

5245
03:09:34,720 --> 03:09:35,520
just do

5246
03:09:35,520 --> 03:09:38,160
simple we're going to just filter on

5247
03:09:38,160 --> 03:09:39,520
events coming from circle

5248
03:09:39,520 --> 03:09:41,200
and we can also add for example events

5249
03:09:41,200 --> 03:09:42,960
that are not published

5250
03:09:42,960 --> 03:09:45,439
if you wanted to do some final checks on

5251
03:09:45,439 --> 03:09:47,359
whether

5252
03:09:47,359 --> 03:09:50,960
uh we need to add the organization again

5253
03:09:50,960 --> 03:09:52,399
whether we have any events that need to

5254
03:09:52,399 --> 03:09:54,080
be vetted for example for our own

5255
03:09:54,080 --> 03:09:55,840
organization then we could use this

5256
03:09:55,840 --> 03:09:57,040
filter for it

5257
03:09:57,040 --> 03:09:58,800
on the event index all of these search

5258
03:09:58,800 --> 03:10:00,479
filters that you apply

5259
03:10:00,479 --> 03:10:02,560
generate a specific url and you can

5260
03:10:02,560 --> 03:10:03,520
bookmark it

5261
03:10:03,520 --> 03:10:05,359
so if you have recurring queries that

5262
03:10:05,359 --> 03:10:06,560
you want to monitor

5263
03:10:06,560 --> 03:10:08,399
then you can just bookmark the url and

5264
03:10:08,399 --> 03:10:09,680
you can go back to it

5265
03:10:09,680 --> 03:10:11,359
later on and see if there is anything

5266
03:10:11,359 --> 03:10:12,960
that popped up that matches your

5267
03:10:12,960 --> 03:10:16,880
search criteria now generally

5268
03:10:16,880 --> 03:10:19,840
like i think 90 of our searches do not

5269
03:10:19,840 --> 03:10:21,200
actually happen via the ui

5270
03:10:21,200 --> 03:10:23,600
they happen via the api so very often

5271
03:10:23,600 --> 03:10:25,200
you have tools that you search through

5272
03:10:25,200 --> 03:10:26,080
so if you have a

5273
03:10:26,080 --> 03:10:28,479
tool that acts as a front-end for your

5274
03:10:28,479 --> 03:10:30,239
miss for certain searches that works as

5275
03:10:30,239 --> 03:10:32,000
well

5276
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:33,439
we're going to talk more about those

5277
03:10:33,439 --> 03:10:34,960
type of searches and how you integrate

5278
03:10:34,960 --> 03:10:37,120
with other tools tomorrow more

5279
03:10:37,120 --> 03:10:39,600
when we go into the api a bit is a

5280
03:10:39,600 --> 03:10:41,279
question about soft delete attribute

5281
03:10:41,279 --> 03:10:42,960
search

5282
03:10:42,960 --> 03:10:45,600
i just lost the q and a so some martin

5283
03:10:45,600 --> 03:10:47,200
asks is there a way to do a global

5284
03:10:47,200 --> 03:10:48,560
search for software

5285
03:10:48,560 --> 03:10:51,840
attributes yes sorry where is it

5286
03:10:51,840 --> 03:10:54,319
there for software attachments yes there

5287
03:10:54,319 --> 03:10:56,479
is

5288
03:10:56,479 --> 03:10:59,359
uh so not via the ui but via the api uh

5289
03:10:59,359 --> 03:11:00,880
which you can also access

5290
03:11:00,880 --> 03:11:02,239
by the way we have two we have a

5291
03:11:02,239 --> 03:11:03,760
built-in tool we can even show it show

5292
03:11:03,760 --> 03:11:04,800
this example there

5293
03:11:04,800 --> 03:11:08,640
we didn't show the delete i

5294
03:11:10,640 --> 03:11:12,640
and let's start with the question first

5295
03:11:12,640 --> 03:11:15,040
and then we go to the delete

5296
03:11:15,040 --> 03:11:16,640
so we have this built-in tool called the

5297
03:11:16,640 --> 03:11:18,560
rest client that allows us to run

5298
03:11:18,560 --> 03:11:22,479
searches directly from the interface so

5299
03:11:22,479 --> 03:11:24,319
generally indeed we have a software

5300
03:11:24,319 --> 03:11:26,000
delete mechanism in bisp

5301
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:29,120
that allows you to to not fully remove

5302
03:11:29,120 --> 03:11:30,080
an attribute but

5303
03:11:30,080 --> 03:11:32,239
mark is for it for deletion the reason

5304
03:11:32,239 --> 03:11:33,920
why we do this in general is

5305
03:11:33,920 --> 03:11:36,160
whenever we're synchronizing information

5306
03:11:36,160 --> 03:11:37,439
and we delete an attribute

5307
03:11:37,439 --> 03:11:38,800
we want to inform all the leather

5308
03:11:38,800 --> 03:11:40,880
instances attribute needs to be removed

5309
03:11:40,880 --> 03:11:42,160
it is revoked

5310
03:11:42,160 --> 03:11:44,239
so this is why we do the soft delete

5311
03:11:44,239 --> 03:11:45,680
when we hide it from the interface

5312
03:11:45,680 --> 03:11:48,479
behind it from the exports

5313
03:11:48,479 --> 03:11:50,640
but we still keep the data and we inform

5314
03:11:50,640 --> 03:11:52,000
the other instances that they need to

5315
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:54,000
also market for deletion

5316
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:57,120
now if the question is how do we do a

5317
03:11:57,120 --> 03:11:58,800
global search for all the soft deleted

5318
03:11:58,800 --> 03:12:00,319
attributes so first of all what we need

5319
03:12:00,319 --> 03:12:00,800
to do

5320
03:12:00,800 --> 03:12:04,479
yeah using our little research too

5321
03:12:04,479 --> 03:12:06,800
is by the way we have the modern apis

5322
03:12:06,800 --> 03:12:08,720
here to create a new api unless you know

5323
03:12:08,720 --> 03:12:11,438
yours by heart

5324
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:17,200
so alex because you it's very good

5325
03:12:17,359 --> 03:12:19,439
so so just quickly that's so uh so in

5326
03:12:19,439 --> 03:12:20,479
the meanwhile what

5327
03:12:20,479 --> 03:12:22,319
alex is doing now is uh he's going to

5328
03:12:22,319 --> 03:12:24,239
generate a new api key for himself

5329
03:12:24,239 --> 03:12:26,960
so that we can actually test the api uh

5330
03:12:26,960 --> 03:12:29,359
queries

5331
03:12:29,359 --> 03:12:33,840
oh that's one word yeah

5332
03:12:35,279 --> 03:12:36,720
yeah you can add enough key from here as

5333
03:12:36,720 --> 03:12:47,840
well this will work yeah that works

5334
03:12:54,130 --> 03:12:57,279
[Music]

5335
03:12:59,680 --> 03:13:01,520
a global action my profile by the way if

5336
03:13:01,520 --> 03:13:16,239
you want to find your profile okay

5337
03:13:17,359 --> 03:13:20,160
so now we have our api key now we go to

5338
03:13:20,160 --> 03:13:21,760
rest client we just paste it in there

5339
03:13:21,760 --> 03:13:22,399
now

5340
03:13:22,399 --> 03:13:25,680
in the authorization field

5341
03:13:27,439 --> 03:13:28,800
here we go and now what we're going to

5342
03:13:28,800 --> 03:13:30,640
do is we're going to uh to run a search

5343
03:13:30,640 --> 03:13:32,080
for all software attributes so we're

5344
03:13:32,080 --> 03:13:32,479
going to

5345
03:13:32,479 --> 03:13:35,680
search for attribute rest search so that

5346
03:13:35,680 --> 03:13:37,520
is a scope that allows us to search on

5347
03:13:37,520 --> 03:13:38,960
the attribute level we'll do we'll see

5348
03:13:38,960 --> 03:13:41,120
more of this tomorrow

5349
03:13:41,120 --> 03:13:44,000
just a small example for return format

5350
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:47,600
let's pick something like json

5351
03:13:53,520 --> 03:13:56,720
and perhaps set a page under limit or

5352
03:13:56,720 --> 03:13:59,520
date one limit 100 or something like

5353
03:13:59,520 --> 03:14:01,120
that

5354
03:14:01,120 --> 03:14:02,479
i don't know how much was deleted here

5355
03:14:02,479 --> 03:14:04,640
but it might be a lot and uh

5356
03:14:04,640 --> 03:14:07,200
then just uh add another key deleted

5357
03:14:07,200 --> 03:14:11,840
there we go

5358
03:14:12,160 --> 03:14:15,439
and then deleted september

5359
03:14:16,399 --> 03:14:19,680
and we don't need anything else

5360
03:14:20,319 --> 03:14:23,279
and this will return the first 100 hits

5361
03:14:23,279 --> 03:14:24,479
from the instance

5362
03:14:24,479 --> 03:14:28,239
of attributes that are deleted

5363
03:14:30,399 --> 03:14:33,600
there we go and now if you if you wanted

5364
03:14:33,600 --> 03:14:35,279
to paginate through all these attributes

5365
03:14:35,279 --> 03:14:36,720
you would have to just raise the page

5366
03:14:36,720 --> 03:14:37,359
number

5367
03:14:37,359 --> 03:14:40,000
go back and and get page 2 page 3 page 4

5368
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:40,800
and so on

5369
03:14:40,800 --> 03:14:42,800
or if we have enough memory certainly my

5370
03:14:42,800 --> 03:14:44,960
training instance definitely doesn't

5371
03:14:44,960 --> 03:14:46,319
then we could just say give us

5372
03:14:46,319 --> 03:14:49,278
everything in one shot

5373
03:14:49,600 --> 03:14:52,080
okay so i hope that answers your

5374
03:14:52,080 --> 03:14:53,840
question martin

5375
03:14:53,840 --> 03:14:56,560
um there is also a question is there an

5376
03:14:56,560 --> 03:14:58,560
official miss docker image

5377
03:14:58,560 --> 03:15:01,600
um and there are actually several uh

5378
03:15:01,600 --> 03:15:04,319
they're not maintained by us but by

5379
03:15:04,319 --> 03:15:05,439
contributors

5380
03:15:05,439 --> 03:15:08,000
that are very active and working closely

5381
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:09,200
with us

5382
03:15:09,200 --> 03:15:11,680
so i've pasted one example in the zoom

5383
03:15:11,680 --> 03:15:13,279
group chat

5384
03:15:13,279 --> 03:15:14,960
i don't know if maybe it's not visible

5385
03:15:14,960 --> 03:15:16,560
to everyone

5386
03:15:16,560 --> 03:15:19,120
i can just drop it as an answer here

5387
03:15:19,120 --> 03:15:20,720
yeah it's better

5388
03:15:20,720 --> 03:15:24,160
so this one is done by cool acid so why

5389
03:15:24,160 --> 03:15:26,080
there are so many docker myths

5390
03:15:26,080 --> 03:15:29,600
that's i think the the

5391
03:15:29,600 --> 03:15:32,399
speciality of docker not everyone agrees

5392
03:15:32,399 --> 03:15:35,200
on a model with docker so there are

5393
03:15:35,200 --> 03:15:37,760
at least as far as i know four or five

5394
03:15:37,760 --> 03:15:39,520
different dockers there's one managed by

5395
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:41,760
dcso one by cool assist

5396
03:15:41,760 --> 03:15:45,040
one by xavier mcpens and one by

5397
03:15:45,040 --> 03:15:47,359
harvard security and i'm sure i'm

5398
03:15:47,359 --> 03:15:48,479
missing some

5399
03:15:48,479 --> 03:15:51,520
um so the thing is um for

5400
03:15:51,520 --> 03:15:54,160
for the docker images it's depending of

5401
03:15:54,160 --> 03:15:55,840
i would say your test

5402
03:15:55,840 --> 03:15:57,600
so have a look at what the different

5403
03:15:57,600 --> 03:15:59,439
contributors are doing

5404
03:15:59,439 --> 03:16:02,000
and you'll see that you pick the one

5405
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:02,800
that is

5406
03:16:02,800 --> 03:16:05,200
matching what you really want to do with

5407
03:16:05,200 --> 03:16:06,160
docker

5408
03:16:06,160 --> 03:16:08,720
some are really more separated container

5409
03:16:08,720 --> 03:16:09,359
wise

5410
03:16:09,359 --> 03:16:11,200
some are more like one single container

5411
03:16:11,200 --> 03:16:12,800
with everything um

5412
03:16:12,800 --> 03:16:14,399
again it's a maker of taste and all you

5413
03:16:14,399 --> 03:16:16,080
want to to operate one

5414
03:16:16,080 --> 03:16:18,399
we don't maintain one as this project

5415
03:16:18,399 --> 03:16:19,359
but there are

5416
03:16:19,359 --> 03:16:21,520
some that are under our missed project

5417
03:16:21,520 --> 03:16:24,399
guitar position

5418
03:16:27,200 --> 03:16:29,920
someone is asking about api key to

5419
03:16:29,920 --> 03:16:33,120
invoke cortex analyzer

5420
03:16:33,520 --> 03:16:36,399
for the cortex analyzer it's a separate

5421
03:16:36,399 --> 03:16:37,040
tool set

5422
03:16:37,040 --> 03:16:40,399
of part of of the i've project

5423
03:16:40,399 --> 03:16:44,319
and then you have specific api keys

5424
03:16:44,319 --> 03:16:46,800
cortex extension is like this module so

5425
03:16:46,800 --> 03:16:48,880
it works for the expansion services

5426
03:16:48,880 --> 03:16:51,040
uh beaker full cortex analyzer are not

5427
03:16:51,040 --> 03:16:52,239
supporting

5428
03:16:52,239 --> 03:16:53,840
objects and stuff like that which is the

5429
03:16:53,840 --> 03:16:55,600
case for its modules

5430
03:16:55,600 --> 03:16:57,600
so you might have expansion on the

5431
03:16:57,600 --> 03:16:59,120
interface but if you want full-blown

5432
03:16:59,120 --> 03:17:01,120
expansion with relationship and so on

5433
03:17:01,120 --> 03:17:03,520
then you can use these modules a lot of

5434
03:17:03,520 --> 03:17:05,359
organizations are mixing both so you can

5435
03:17:05,359 --> 03:17:06,800
have cortex-enabled and

5436
03:17:06,800 --> 03:17:09,359
it's modulus enabled on the same missed

5437
03:17:09,359 --> 03:17:10,239
instance

5438
03:17:10,239 --> 03:17:11,680
but going back to the question if you

5439
03:17:11,680 --> 03:17:13,920
already have the cortex api encoded in

5440
03:17:13,920 --> 03:17:16,160
your misspen you want to invoke

5441
03:17:16,160 --> 03:17:18,960
a lookup uh through the api through misp

5442
03:17:18,960 --> 03:17:20,960
then you can use your misspik to tell

5443
03:17:20,960 --> 03:17:22,239
your misp to

5444
03:17:22,239 --> 03:17:27,439
run a query against cortex

5445
03:17:27,439 --> 03:17:29,520
but with the new api key models usually

5446
03:17:29,520 --> 03:17:33,200
it's better to have dedicated api

5447
03:17:35,600 --> 03:17:39,680
okay um there is something else easy

5448
03:17:39,680 --> 03:17:42,570
you know that we had it already um

5449
03:17:42,570 --> 03:17:44,479
[Music]

5450
03:17:44,479 --> 03:17:46,160
could you touch on how we could use one

5451
03:17:46,160 --> 03:17:48,160
event to add multiple attributes and how

5452
03:17:48,160 --> 03:17:50,640
would correlation work here uh configure

5453
03:17:50,640 --> 03:17:52,399
event one to fetch all records from a

5454
03:17:52,399 --> 03:17:53,359
fishing feed

5455
03:17:53,359 --> 03:17:54,800
would this work with correlation show

5456
03:17:54,800 --> 03:17:56,800
all instances where any of those

5457
03:17:56,800 --> 03:17:58,720
attributes match with other events from

5458
03:17:58,720 --> 03:17:59,760
other organization

5459
03:17:59,760 --> 03:18:02,800
events well okay if i understand it

5460
03:18:02,800 --> 03:18:03,760
correctly indeed

5461
03:18:03,760 --> 03:18:06,319
so if you if you do that you create an

5462
03:18:06,319 --> 03:18:08,319
event for a fishing feed

5463
03:18:08,319 --> 03:18:09,920
and you have those attributes in there

5464
03:18:09,920 --> 03:18:11,920
and you have cross you have cached

5465
03:18:11,920 --> 03:18:14,880
other instances then within that that

5466
03:18:14,880 --> 03:18:16,880
feeds event you will see correlations

5467
03:18:16,880 --> 03:18:17,520
both to

5468
03:18:17,520 --> 03:18:19,279
other events created locally on your

5469
03:18:19,279 --> 03:18:21,359
instance by other organizations

5470
03:18:21,359 --> 03:18:23,359
as well as links to other instances that

5471
03:18:23,359 --> 03:18:24,720
have the

5472
03:18:24,720 --> 03:18:26,960
data as long as you have cached those

5473
03:18:26,960 --> 03:18:27,760
events

5474
03:18:27,760 --> 03:18:29,439
so we're going to talk more about that

5475
03:18:29,439 --> 03:18:31,120
tomorrow about the synchronization but

5476
03:18:31,120 --> 03:18:31,840
when you're

5477
03:18:31,840 --> 03:18:33,439
interconnecting with another instance

5478
03:18:33,439 --> 03:18:34,880
you can do it in two ways

5479
03:18:34,880 --> 03:18:36,640
one i want to start exchanging data

5480
03:18:36,640 --> 03:18:38,399
pushing data pooling data

5481
03:18:38,399 --> 03:18:40,640
or two i can just tell my mist to go

5482
03:18:40,640 --> 03:18:42,319
crawl that other instance

5483
03:18:42,319 --> 03:18:44,800
uh hash all the values that they have

5484
03:18:44,800 --> 03:18:46,560
and if i ever get the correlation

5485
03:18:46,560 --> 03:18:48,560
then it flags it for me that it shows me

5486
03:18:48,560 --> 03:18:50,080
and then that the

5487
03:18:50,080 --> 03:18:52,080
instance already knows about this value

5488
03:18:52,080 --> 03:18:54,239
and i can pivot over to previewing the

5489
03:18:54,239 --> 03:18:55,920
data

5490
03:18:55,920 --> 03:18:58,399
so i hope that answers that yeah and

5491
03:18:58,399 --> 03:19:00,080
then the correlation of

5492
03:19:00,080 --> 03:19:01,359
for example if you just enable the

5493
03:19:01,359 --> 03:19:03,600
caching you just see that it's

5494
03:19:03,600 --> 03:19:05,760
correlating with specific values without

5495
03:19:05,760 --> 03:19:08,479
providing the full fit sometimes it's

5496
03:19:08,479 --> 03:19:09,279
it's quite

5497
03:19:09,279 --> 03:19:11,520
handy when you have for example see that

5498
03:19:11,520 --> 03:19:13,040
you cannot show the data but you can

5499
03:19:13,040 --> 03:19:15,920
show the correlation

5500
03:19:16,160 --> 03:19:17,439
there's another one do you recommend

5501
03:19:17,439 --> 03:19:19,680
using miss palone or using the hive

5502
03:19:19,680 --> 03:19:22,399
miss cortex integration i mean generally

5503
03:19:22,399 --> 03:19:22,800
yeah

5504
03:19:22,800 --> 03:19:24,479
if you need a case management tool then

5505
03:19:24,479 --> 03:19:26,319
then using the hive for that is great

5506
03:19:26,319 --> 03:19:29,920
and so it makes absolute sense to you to

5507
03:19:29,920 --> 03:19:31,439
use them together

5508
03:19:31,439 --> 03:19:33,920
and integration is really smoothly done

5509
03:19:33,920 --> 03:19:34,880
so that means that

5510
03:19:34,880 --> 03:19:36,640
that no matter where you start your your

5511
03:19:36,640 --> 03:19:38,239
process whether you start

5512
03:19:38,239 --> 03:19:40,399
by creating an event in misp or whether

5513
03:19:40,399 --> 03:19:41,840
you start by creating a

5514
03:19:41,840 --> 03:19:44,080
case in the hive you can basically

5515
03:19:44,080 --> 03:19:46,000
propagate the data to the other tool and

5516
03:19:46,000 --> 03:19:46,640
work on

5517
03:19:46,640 --> 03:19:49,200
on both tools and data so so yeah

5518
03:19:49,200 --> 03:19:50,080
absolutely

5519
03:19:50,080 --> 03:19:52,080
yeah absolutely it's pretty smooth just

5520
03:19:52,080 --> 03:19:54,560
just be careful if you use the expansion

5521
03:19:54,560 --> 03:19:56,160
on mist and you have miss modules

5522
03:19:56,160 --> 03:19:58,800
enabled i would prefer to have

5523
03:19:58,800 --> 03:20:00,319
modules enabled because you you

5524
03:20:00,319 --> 03:20:03,200
basically have all the features of mixed

5525
03:20:03,200 --> 03:20:06,319
like relationship objects and so on

5526
03:20:06,319 --> 03:20:08,160
with the cortex integration is basically

5527
03:20:08,160 --> 03:20:09,439
just the over with

5528
03:20:09,439 --> 03:20:11,600
the vortex yeah but one of the things

5529
03:20:11,600 --> 03:20:12,560
that you can do is

5530
03:20:12,560 --> 03:20:14,080
if you start for example from the hive

5531
03:20:14,080 --> 03:20:16,000
perspective and you push the data

5532
03:20:16,000 --> 03:20:17,279
afterwards to misp

5533
03:20:17,279 --> 03:20:18,800
you can then go through this process

5534
03:20:18,800 --> 03:20:20,640
like what we've done here with enriching

5535
03:20:20,640 --> 03:20:21,760
the information

5536
03:20:21,760 --> 03:20:24,160
creating objects that affect attributes

5537
03:20:24,160 --> 03:20:25,760
so you can do it as a secondary step

5538
03:20:25,760 --> 03:20:27,200
before you share it out to community to

5539
03:20:27,200 --> 03:20:28,000
refine the data

5540
03:20:28,000 --> 03:20:30,080
in mis that you've created in the i for

5541
03:20:30,080 --> 03:20:31,920
example and the same thing if you've

5542
03:20:31,920 --> 03:20:33,439
used cortex to fetch additional

5543
03:20:33,439 --> 03:20:34,720
information in the hive

5544
03:20:34,720 --> 03:20:36,399
you can then take that data and further

5545
03:20:36,399 --> 03:20:38,000
enrich it with miss modules once it's a

5546
03:20:38,000 --> 03:20:38,960
message

5547
03:20:38,960 --> 03:20:40,960
yeah this is a good question from

5548
03:20:40,960 --> 03:20:42,080
muammar

5549
03:20:42,080 --> 03:20:45,279
junaid about when i try to import the

5550
03:20:45,279 --> 03:20:47,120
data from six to five it's called

5551
03:20:47,120 --> 03:20:49,040
lazy like can you please explain that a

5552
03:20:49,040 --> 03:20:50,880
bit and this one is interesting

5553
03:20:50,880 --> 03:20:52,640
because it's it's i was saying a long

5554
03:20:52,640 --> 03:20:54,399
long long discussion and that

5555
03:20:54,399 --> 03:20:57,359
that's even influence or miss people

5556
03:20:57,359 --> 03:21:00,000
than the standard behind missed

5557
03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:03,040
so sticks is really uh focusing on cyber

5558
03:21:03,040 --> 03:21:04,000
security and

5559
03:21:04,000 --> 03:21:07,279
cyber studies religion and

5560
03:21:07,279 --> 03:21:10,319
the the problem is you might have at

5561
03:21:10,319 --> 03:21:11,920
some point in time

5562
03:21:11,920 --> 03:21:13,760
data that are basically not defined

5563
03:21:13,760 --> 03:21:15,120
anywhere

5564
03:21:15,120 --> 03:21:17,760
so it's more for the export of data so

5565
03:21:17,760 --> 03:21:20,160
for example if you export in a mixed

5566
03:21:20,160 --> 03:21:23,040
event and you have for example an object

5567
03:21:23,040 --> 03:21:23,439
with

5568
03:21:23,439 --> 03:21:25,520
the person and stuff like that it won't

5569
03:21:25,520 --> 03:21:28,479
be in the sticks to export for example

5570
03:21:28,479 --> 03:21:31,600
so it means that in misprevent you get

5571
03:21:31,600 --> 03:21:33,520
all the information but it's bound to

5572
03:21:33,520 --> 03:21:35,200
the limitation of the standards and the

5573
03:21:35,200 --> 03:21:36,239
format

5574
03:21:36,239 --> 03:21:37,600
where you export and it's exactly the

5575
03:21:37,600 --> 03:21:39,520
same for any format i mean if you

5576
03:21:39,520 --> 03:21:42,239
um export a person in theory cata format

5577
03:21:42,239 --> 03:21:43,760
obviously you don't have any

5578
03:21:43,760 --> 03:21:46,800
um field or things like that with person

5579
03:21:46,800 --> 03:21:47,600
and so on so

5580
03:21:47,600 --> 03:21:49,439
that's why we call it losing because uh

5581
03:21:49,439 --> 03:21:51,439
sometimes when you import data

5582
03:21:51,439 --> 03:21:55,840
it's bound to a specific set of

5583
03:21:55,920 --> 03:21:58,000
fields that are supported and so on

5584
03:21:58,000 --> 03:21:58,960
another thing that is

5585
03:21:58,960 --> 03:22:01,359
quite important with sticks you might

5586
03:22:01,359 --> 03:22:02,720
have a lot of

5587
03:22:02,720 --> 03:22:05,279
peculiarities or specialities depending

5588
03:22:05,279 --> 03:22:06,640
on the vendor

5589
03:22:06,640 --> 03:22:08,479
some vendors are adding some some

5590
03:22:08,479 --> 03:22:09,840
specific custom objects

5591
03:22:09,840 --> 03:22:11,680
things like that that are not bound to

5592
03:22:11,680 --> 03:22:13,359
any existing one

5593
03:22:13,359 --> 03:22:15,600
so we are importing them as kind of you

5594
03:22:15,600 --> 03:22:16,960
know generic one but

5595
03:22:16,960 --> 03:22:20,239
it is basically like uh lucy again so

5596
03:22:20,239 --> 03:22:22,239
you have to be careful when you you use

5597
03:22:22,239 --> 03:22:23,760
a specific format

5598
03:22:23,760 --> 03:22:26,319
to be sure that you properly uh map an

5599
03:22:26,319 --> 03:22:27,040
existing

5600
03:22:27,040 --> 03:22:29,200
different one so it's more for the

5601
03:22:29,200 --> 03:22:31,200
export is quite flexible on that so you

5602
03:22:31,200 --> 03:22:33,520
can basically have any object you like

5603
03:22:33,520 --> 03:22:36,239
but when we explore for example in 61 we

5604
03:22:36,239 --> 03:22:36,880
just

5605
03:22:36,880 --> 03:22:39,840
support what is existing in sticks even

5606
03:22:39,840 --> 03:22:41,040
if we start we add

5607
03:22:41,040 --> 03:22:43,359
some some custom objects too which are

5608
03:22:43,359 --> 03:22:45,840
on to the missed object

5609
03:22:45,840 --> 03:22:47,840
but some tools will not recognize

5610
03:22:47,840 --> 03:22:49,680
obviously the custom object because they

5611
03:22:49,680 --> 03:22:50,080
are

5612
03:22:50,080 --> 03:22:52,080
just having a profile for a specific set

5613
03:22:52,080 --> 03:22:53,840
of known uh updates

5614
03:22:53,840 --> 03:22:56,399
yeah i think that's exactly the point uh

5615
03:22:56,399 --> 03:22:56,960
that

5616
03:22:56,960 --> 03:22:58,239
maybe is different from when we

5617
03:22:58,239 --> 03:23:00,960
described the text in those import and

5618
03:23:00,960 --> 03:23:02,000
export fields

5619
03:23:02,000 --> 03:23:04,160
we say lossy but in reality what we do

5620
03:23:04,160 --> 03:23:06,160
is we do try to capture everything and

5621
03:23:06,160 --> 03:23:07,120
we do try to map

5622
03:23:07,120 --> 03:23:08,960
everything but a lot of it will end up

5623
03:23:08,960 --> 03:23:10,479
in custom objects now

5624
03:23:10,479 --> 03:23:13,040
now what alex mentioned is the problem

5625
03:23:13,040 --> 03:23:14,960
even if we export bitcoin

5626
03:23:14,960 --> 03:23:16,399
addresses for example whenever we're

5627
03:23:16,399 --> 03:23:18,239
pushing in sticks to format

5628
03:23:18,239 --> 03:23:20,479
as custom objects no other two will pick

5629
03:23:20,479 --> 03:23:21,359
up on it because

5630
03:23:21,359 --> 03:23:23,840
it's if we're just using custom objects

5631
03:23:23,840 --> 03:23:25,439
that unless the other two

5632
03:23:25,439 --> 03:23:27,040
specifically looks for them they will

5633
03:23:27,040 --> 03:23:28,720
just either store it as is

5634
03:23:28,720 --> 03:23:31,120
or not know what to do with it yeah and

5635
03:23:31,120 --> 03:23:32,239
that

5636
03:23:32,239 --> 03:23:35,439
that's why we recommend a feed provider

5637
03:23:35,439 --> 03:23:35,680
of

5638
03:23:35,680 --> 03:23:38,080
anderson son to actively support the

5639
03:23:38,080 --> 03:23:39,040
misformat

5640
03:23:39,040 --> 03:23:41,040
then they can they can really impose a

5641
03:23:41,040 --> 03:23:42,840
full set of objects and so that already

5642
03:23:42,840 --> 03:23:44,239
exists

5643
03:23:44,239 --> 03:23:46,160
yeah in some cases however you don't

5644
03:23:46,160 --> 03:23:47,760
really care about having the full set

5645
03:23:47,760 --> 03:23:49,439
and that's where for example specialized

5646
03:23:49,439 --> 03:23:50,960
formats are really cool

5647
03:23:50,960 --> 03:23:53,040
so whenever we're feeding for example an

5648
03:23:53,040 --> 03:23:55,200
ids for example we don't care about

5649
03:23:55,200 --> 03:23:56,560
bitcoin addresses

5650
03:23:56,560 --> 03:23:59,359
so in those cases uh so sticks and misp

5651
03:23:59,359 --> 03:23:59,760
both

5652
03:23:59,760 --> 03:24:04,080
are very expressive uh exchange formats

5653
03:24:04,080 --> 03:24:05,760
but whenever you're dealing with feeding

5654
03:24:05,760 --> 03:24:07,920
tools for example you don't care about

5655
03:24:07,920 --> 03:24:10,239
uh about losing ninety percent even of

5656
03:24:10,239 --> 03:24:11,200
the data set

5657
03:24:11,200 --> 03:24:13,680
as long as you capture those type of

5658
03:24:13,680 --> 03:24:15,120
data points that your tool can

5659
03:24:15,120 --> 03:24:17,680
process in the end so this is why

5660
03:24:17,680 --> 03:24:19,040
generally what we recommend is if you

5661
03:24:19,040 --> 03:24:20,560
have the option for example to export

5662
03:24:20,560 --> 03:24:21,200
data from

5663
03:24:21,200 --> 03:24:23,040
is for your ideas for your scene and so

5664
03:24:23,040 --> 03:24:24,800
on and you have the option between for

5665
03:24:24,800 --> 03:24:27,359
example sticks or snort or surikata

5666
03:24:27,359 --> 03:24:29,520
go with snorter sturikata because

5667
03:24:29,520 --> 03:24:31,279
because those are much more

5668
03:24:31,279 --> 03:24:33,760
uh catering to what your two can

5669
03:24:33,760 --> 03:24:35,040
actually understand

5670
03:24:35,040 --> 03:24:37,200
yeah for example for yards the same you

5671
03:24:37,200 --> 03:24:40,080
prefer to have like a good yara who will

5672
03:24:40,080 --> 03:24:41,680
say that you can run into another

5673
03:24:41,680 --> 03:24:43,279
barista or your endpoint protection

5674
03:24:43,279 --> 03:24:44,000
device

5675
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:46,160
and having a generic one that will not

5676
03:24:46,160 --> 03:24:49,840
help you to lose the detection

5677
03:24:52,560 --> 03:24:55,840
other questions

5678
03:24:56,080 --> 03:24:58,640
you already took that one that is there

5679
03:24:58,640 --> 03:24:59,120
it is

5680
03:24:59,120 --> 03:25:00,880
longer i think we took most of them

5681
03:25:00,880 --> 03:25:03,920
unless they missed one

5682
03:25:03,920 --> 03:25:06,239
and yeah perhaps we should show the

5683
03:25:06,239 --> 03:25:08,399
deletions because we we didn't actually

5684
03:25:08,399 --> 03:25:09,200
show it indeed

5685
03:25:09,200 --> 03:25:11,760
yeah exactly

5686
03:25:13,760 --> 03:25:16,080
okay oh and now we have some more

5687
03:25:16,080 --> 03:25:17,040
questions

5688
03:25:17,040 --> 03:25:20,160
but we can take those after yeah let's

5689
03:25:20,160 --> 03:25:22,479
quickly show the deletions so if we go

5690
03:25:22,479 --> 03:25:23,920
to an event

5691
03:25:23,920 --> 03:25:25,200
yeah i'll take i'll take a hundred

5692
03:25:25,200 --> 03:25:27,279
members so this is a massive

5693
03:25:27,279 --> 03:25:30,800
gotcha basic basically missed

5694
03:25:30,800 --> 03:25:32,319
uh which we have some protective

5695
03:25:32,319 --> 03:25:33,840
measures in place to avoid this but one

5696
03:25:33,840 --> 03:25:34,800
of the things that you really need to

5697
03:25:34,800 --> 03:25:37,439
watch out for is

5698
03:25:37,439 --> 03:25:39,760
when you when you add data to misspen

5699
03:25:39,760 --> 03:25:40,479
you notice

5700
03:25:40,479 --> 03:25:42,399
oh crap i should not have added a piece

5701
03:25:42,399 --> 03:25:44,239
of information that is

5702
03:25:44,239 --> 03:25:45,920
either confidential information

5703
03:25:45,920 --> 03:25:47,359
information about the victim that i

5704
03:25:47,359 --> 03:25:49,520
should share and so on

5705
03:25:49,520 --> 03:25:51,760
the attribute that attribute might still

5706
03:25:51,760 --> 03:25:53,279
be contained in the event in a

5707
03:25:53,279 --> 03:25:55,200
in a soft deleted format you can always

5708
03:25:55,200 --> 03:25:57,200
toggle and see the deleted attributes

5709
03:25:57,200 --> 03:26:00,319
uh within an event

5710
03:26:00,880 --> 03:26:02,560
so i will create i will create an even

5711
03:26:02,560 --> 03:26:05,039
from scratch

5712
03:26:05,840 --> 03:26:09,200
okay so before i move forward on that so

5713
03:26:09,200 --> 03:26:10,800
we have two protective measures in place

5714
03:26:10,800 --> 03:26:13,120
to avoid accidental information leakage

5715
03:26:13,120 --> 03:26:16,800
violation one is basically that

5716
03:26:16,800 --> 03:26:18,479
that by default we do not use the

5717
03:26:18,479 --> 03:26:20,319
software method for anything that was

5718
03:26:20,319 --> 03:26:21,520
unpublished uh

5719
03:26:21,520 --> 03:26:23,520
at first so we're going to show it as an

5720
03:26:23,520 --> 03:26:24,960
example so here's some sensitive

5721
03:26:24,960 --> 03:26:25,760
information

5722
03:26:25,760 --> 03:26:27,600
if alex were to delete this now this

5723
03:26:27,600 --> 03:26:30,560
attribute this would get our deleted

5724
03:26:30,560 --> 03:26:32,720
so this will not create a soft deletion

5725
03:26:32,720 --> 03:26:33,920
uh miss pareto

5726
03:26:33,920 --> 03:26:35,760
tells us are you sure you want to hard

5727
03:26:35,760 --> 03:26:37,200
delete the attribute so when you read

5728
03:26:37,200 --> 03:26:38,319
the text you will see the see the

5729
03:26:38,319 --> 03:26:40,080
difference there in the wording

5730
03:26:40,080 --> 03:26:42,000
uh the reason for that is the event it

5731
03:26:42,000 --> 03:26:43,520
has not been published yet we know that

5732
03:26:43,520 --> 03:26:44,880
it has not probably been propagated to

5733
03:26:44,880 --> 03:26:46,080
other instances

5734
03:26:46,080 --> 03:26:48,000
there is absolutely no reason to inform

5735
03:26:48,000 --> 03:26:50,319
anyone that this has been deleted

5736
03:26:50,319 --> 03:26:52,160
so we can immediately just hard delete

5737
03:26:52,160 --> 03:26:54,560
it so when we do that

5738
03:26:54,560 --> 03:26:56,560
it will get hard deleted however if the

5739
03:26:56,560 --> 03:26:58,239
event has already been published

5740
03:26:58,239 --> 03:26:59,840
this has already been shared out to

5741
03:26:59,840 --> 03:27:01,760
other instances potentially

5742
03:27:01,760 --> 03:27:03,920
so in this case if we were to delete it

5743
03:27:03,920 --> 03:27:05,439
miss will tell us oh

5744
03:27:05,439 --> 03:27:06,800
are you sure you want to soft delete

5745
03:27:06,800 --> 03:27:08,720
this attribute because this is already a

5746
03:27:08,720 --> 03:27:10,080
published event

5747
03:27:10,080 --> 03:27:12,640
now it looks like our event is empty but

5748
03:27:12,640 --> 03:27:14,160
if you look at the deleted flag you will

5749
03:27:14,160 --> 03:27:15,520
see that the sensitive attribute is

5750
03:27:15,520 --> 03:27:16,319
still there

5751
03:27:16,319 --> 03:27:18,479
and if i were to publish the event now

5752
03:27:18,479 --> 03:27:20,479
this sensitive attribute would

5753
03:27:20,479 --> 03:27:22,000
it would get propagated along with the

5754
03:27:22,000 --> 03:27:25,040
event if you want to avoid this

5755
03:27:25,040 --> 03:27:27,359
altogether there is a way to mangle any

5756
03:27:27,359 --> 03:27:29,200
attribute that gets self-deleted

5757
03:27:29,200 --> 03:27:31,680
what happens in that case is a category

5758
03:27:31,680 --> 03:27:32,800
will be set to other

5759
03:27:32,800 --> 03:27:34,800
type will be set to other and value will

5760
03:27:34,800 --> 03:27:36,640
be set to redacted

5761
03:27:36,640 --> 03:27:38,640
this is a server-wide setting so your

5762
03:27:38,640 --> 03:27:39,920
administrator or if you are the

5763
03:27:39,920 --> 03:27:41,520
administrator and yourself can set this

5764
03:27:41,520 --> 03:27:44,319
setting in the server settings

5765
03:27:44,319 --> 03:27:46,160
the downside of that is if you are

5766
03:27:46,160 --> 03:27:47,520
mangling attributes that you're soft

5767
03:27:47,520 --> 03:27:49,200
deleting it will still inform the other

5768
03:27:49,200 --> 03:27:51,279
instances they will still

5769
03:27:51,279 --> 03:27:52,880
remove the data software the data

5770
03:27:52,880 --> 03:27:55,040
because the uid is reserved

5771
03:27:55,040 --> 03:27:57,279
however you cannot recover the attribute

5772
03:27:57,279 --> 03:27:58,239
anymore so if

5773
03:27:58,239 --> 03:28:00,239
so in this case right now we deleted

5774
03:28:00,239 --> 03:28:01,760
attribute alex could now click on the

5775
03:28:01,760 --> 03:28:02,800
recover button

5776
03:28:02,800 --> 03:28:04,640
and the attribute will be recovered as a

5777
03:28:04,640 --> 03:28:06,080
normal attribute so if you made a

5778
03:28:06,080 --> 03:28:07,920
mistake you can recover it

5779
03:28:07,920 --> 03:28:11,040
so there are two different mindsets i

5780
03:28:11,040 --> 03:28:12,880
want to make my data recoverable

5781
03:28:12,880 --> 03:28:14,960
versus and i want to always inform

5782
03:28:14,960 --> 03:28:17,279
others versus i want to always

5783
03:28:17,279 --> 03:28:20,080
hard delete data that i delete both of

5784
03:28:20,080 --> 03:28:21,359
them have a setting

5785
03:28:21,359 --> 03:28:23,520
so just pick and choose which whichever

5786
03:28:23,520 --> 03:28:25,040
makes sense for your community

5787
03:28:25,040 --> 03:28:27,680
whether you prefer secrecy or prefer

5788
03:28:27,680 --> 03:28:28,479
convenience

5789
03:28:28,479 --> 03:28:32,080
uh basically so it's basically

5790
03:28:32,080 --> 03:28:34,160
yeah that's delete for that review so if

5791
03:28:34,160 --> 03:28:35,200
we delete an

5792
03:28:35,200 --> 03:28:38,319
event that's another story yeah and this

5793
03:28:38,319 --> 03:28:41,120
this one is interesting because now we

5794
03:28:41,120 --> 03:28:42,399
have these options where we say

5795
03:28:42,399 --> 03:28:44,640
i want to delete this event and

5796
03:28:44,640 --> 03:28:46,080
obviously it will be deleted on your

5797
03:28:46,080 --> 03:28:46,800
instance

5798
03:28:46,800 --> 03:28:49,200
nevertheless this even has been already

5799
03:28:49,200 --> 03:28:50,160
synchronized

5800
03:28:50,160 --> 03:28:52,160
copy and develop different misc

5801
03:28:52,160 --> 03:28:53,200
instances

5802
03:28:53,200 --> 03:28:54,399
so that means as the next

5803
03:28:54,399 --> 03:28:56,239
synchronizations the event should be

5804
03:28:56,239 --> 03:28:57,040
pulled

5805
03:28:57,040 --> 03:28:59,920
but to avoid such kind of of issue mist

5806
03:28:59,920 --> 03:29:01,680
is automatically generating

5807
03:29:01,680 --> 03:29:05,520
a block list of all those elite events

5808
03:29:05,520 --> 03:29:07,359
so if you are the administrator you can

5809
03:29:07,359 --> 03:29:09,600
see at the block list of events

5810
03:29:09,600 --> 03:29:12,239
you can see the the one that i just

5811
03:29:12,239 --> 03:29:13,120
deleted

5812
03:29:13,120 --> 03:29:16,239
so why we do that it's very simple

5813
03:29:16,239 --> 03:29:18,720
we don't want to re-import the event

5814
03:29:18,720 --> 03:29:20,239
that has been deleted because luckily we

5815
03:29:20,239 --> 03:29:21,359
don't want this event

5816
03:29:21,359 --> 03:29:23,680
so it's a it's a block list of all the

5817
03:29:23,680 --> 03:29:25,520
cgas

5818
03:29:25,520 --> 03:29:28,720
but this this catch there uh sometimes

5819
03:29:28,720 --> 03:29:30,399
we have people oh i'm doing some tests

5820
03:29:30,399 --> 03:29:31,760
and so on i'm synchronizing with miss

5821
03:29:31,760 --> 03:29:33,439
but i can't see my even back

5822
03:29:33,439 --> 03:29:35,439
and obviously yes because it's there in

5823
03:29:35,439 --> 03:29:36,479
this block list

5824
03:29:36,479 --> 03:29:37,840
so if you have some tests and you're

5825
03:29:37,840 --> 03:29:39,359
running some tests don't forget to look

5826
03:29:39,359 --> 03:29:40,399
at the block list

5827
03:29:40,399 --> 03:29:44,160
and maybe you want to just remove

5828
03:29:44,160 --> 03:29:46,319
the event for the block keys and then

5829
03:29:46,319 --> 03:29:48,720
you can synchronize back the event

5830
03:29:48,720 --> 03:29:50,479
there's something to keep in mind it's

5831
03:29:50,479 --> 03:29:52,560
there it's done automatically but in

5832
03:29:52,560 --> 03:29:54,080
some cases you want to manage the

5833
03:29:54,080 --> 03:29:54,800
blockly

5834
03:29:54,800 --> 03:29:58,000
so that's something to keep in mind

5835
03:29:58,000 --> 03:30:01,520
yep something else

5836
03:30:01,520 --> 03:30:04,479
that we perhaps should uh touch on here

5837
03:30:04,479 --> 03:30:06,080
is is

5838
03:30:06,080 --> 03:30:08,800
for the event deletions besides just a

5839
03:30:08,800 --> 03:30:09,760
blockless part

5840
03:30:09,760 --> 03:30:11,120
there is one thing that comes up as a

5841
03:30:11,120 --> 03:30:12,800
question very often is how do i inform

5842
03:30:12,800 --> 03:30:15,040
others that an event needs to be removed

5843
03:30:15,040 --> 03:30:16,640
we don't have a mechanism in place for

5844
03:30:16,640 --> 03:30:19,040
that so while we can revoke attributes

5845
03:30:19,040 --> 03:30:21,520
for events uh we don't have that and

5846
03:30:21,520 --> 03:30:23,120
there's a reason for that

5847
03:30:23,120 --> 03:30:25,279
in general uh whenever it comes to

5848
03:30:25,279 --> 03:30:26,239
events uh

5849
03:30:26,239 --> 03:30:29,200
we don't want to give the power to just

5850
03:30:29,200 --> 03:30:30,640
outright delete

5851
03:30:30,640 --> 03:30:33,439
events uh remotely this way so this

5852
03:30:33,439 --> 03:30:34,720
might change in the future

5853
03:30:34,720 --> 03:30:36,239
we we're having discussions on that

5854
03:30:36,239 --> 03:30:37,920
whether we want to enable that or not

5855
03:30:37,920 --> 03:30:40,080
but currently that's not the case yeah

5856
03:30:40,080 --> 03:30:41,840
and usually we take as an example

5857
03:30:41,840 --> 03:30:44,399
emails i mean you can remove emails from

5858
03:30:44,399 --> 03:30:46,000
your personal mailbox but from the

5859
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:47,359
remote mailbox if someone already

5860
03:30:47,359 --> 03:30:49,120
receives the emails

5861
03:30:49,120 --> 03:30:51,279
you want to have the control over third

5862
03:30:51,279 --> 03:30:53,120
parties on the mailbox that

5863
03:30:53,120 --> 03:30:58,080
might be one of the drawback i would say

5864
03:30:58,080 --> 03:31:00,239
so there are two two new questions one

5865
03:31:00,239 --> 03:31:01,760
of them is basically can you demonstrate

5866
03:31:01,760 --> 03:31:03,439
the progressive enrichments of events

5867
03:31:03,439 --> 03:31:05,200
by the shared communities over time with

5868
03:31:05,200 --> 03:31:06,560
correlations

5869
03:31:06,560 --> 03:31:08,960
this one is tough i mean i'm not sure

5870
03:31:08,960 --> 03:31:10,399
how we could demonstrate that because

5871
03:31:10,399 --> 03:31:11,279
we're not dealing with

5872
03:31:11,279 --> 03:31:14,160
live instances with live data sets and

5873
03:31:14,160 --> 03:31:14,560
act

5874
03:31:14,560 --> 03:31:17,278
active sharing

5875
03:31:17,840 --> 03:31:19,680
but perhaps for tomorrow we will prepare

5876
03:31:19,680 --> 03:31:23,040
an example where we can show it off

5877
03:31:23,040 --> 03:31:25,520
when and choose an event that we can

5878
03:31:25,520 --> 03:31:28,640
show on one of the operational instances

5879
03:31:28,640 --> 03:31:31,120
but i i can't show one on uh you know

5880
03:31:31,120 --> 03:31:33,120
what i can't go on

5881
03:31:33,120 --> 03:31:36,560
just one thing i'm i'm going on an

5882
03:31:36,560 --> 03:31:38,080
instance

5883
03:31:38,080 --> 03:31:41,760
okay so so it was

5884
03:31:41,760 --> 03:31:43,760
oh we are flexible so it's not super fun

5885
03:31:43,760 --> 03:31:45,200
to do it no but

5886
03:31:45,200 --> 03:31:48,319
um so it's maybe some some something

5887
03:31:48,319 --> 03:31:49,359
interesting there

5888
03:31:49,359 --> 03:31:52,000
um so um i'm connecting an instance

5889
03:31:52,000 --> 03:31:52,720
where i have

5890
03:31:52,720 --> 03:31:55,760
more expansion services uh active and so

5891
03:31:55,760 --> 03:31:57,279
on

5892
03:31:57,279 --> 03:31:59,200
i'll just keep it for my organization

5893
03:31:59,200 --> 03:32:01,040
only so i'm creating

5894
03:32:01,040 --> 03:32:05,520
an event there so what happens on

5895
03:32:05,520 --> 03:32:07,600
progressively enriching even by shared

5896
03:32:07,600 --> 03:32:08,960
communities i mean

5897
03:32:08,960 --> 03:32:10,479
it's going back and forth to different

5898
03:32:10,479 --> 03:32:12,160
communities but i can i can imitate what

5899
03:32:12,160 --> 03:32:14,560
the community is doing usually

5900
03:32:14,560 --> 03:32:18,160
so if i'm facing an attribute

5901
03:32:18,160 --> 03:32:21,600
for example i will i will say it

5902
03:32:21,600 --> 03:32:26,399
hostname with some network activity

5903
03:32:32,960 --> 03:32:35,680
so we have specifically a test that we

5904
03:32:35,680 --> 03:32:36,880
created with this

5905
03:32:36,880 --> 03:32:39,439
kind of thing so what would be your

5906
03:32:39,439 --> 03:32:40,560
community and

5907
03:32:40,560 --> 03:32:41,920
sharing so it could be for example in

5908
03:32:41,920 --> 03:32:43,600
the same organization in my case it's

5909
03:32:43,600 --> 03:32:45,680
just clear to the organization so

5910
03:32:45,680 --> 03:32:48,800
if i publish event here it will be

5911
03:32:48,800 --> 03:32:50,000
shared with

5912
03:32:50,000 --> 03:32:51,520
all different instances maybe the

5913
03:32:51,520 --> 03:32:53,520
different members of circle

5914
03:32:53,520 --> 03:32:57,680
uh and um one of my colleagues

5915
03:32:57,680 --> 03:33:01,840
is taking one of the indicators

5916
03:33:01,840 --> 03:33:04,720
and then he's going on the far side

5917
03:33:04,720 --> 03:33:05,760
database

5918
03:33:05,760 --> 03:33:07,600
doing a full-blown expansion so that

5919
03:33:07,600 --> 03:33:09,120
means he's basically doing a full-bone

5920
03:33:09,120 --> 03:33:10,160
extension

5921
03:33:10,160 --> 03:33:13,760
um what do i have here i have a

5922
03:33:13,760 --> 03:33:16,960
a complete set of objects for a specific

5923
03:33:16,960 --> 03:33:18,720
domain so you see again

5924
03:33:18,720 --> 03:33:22,319
i'm going to the event graph

5925
03:33:22,319 --> 03:33:25,040
now i enter my domain name and i have

5926
03:33:25,040 --> 03:33:25,680
all the

5927
03:33:25,680 --> 03:33:27,359
passive dns free curve associated to

5928
03:33:27,359 --> 03:33:28,960
that one

5929
03:33:28,960 --> 03:33:31,760
and in this one i think i will have the

5930
03:33:31,760 --> 03:33:33,200
even timeline i have a completely

5931
03:33:33,200 --> 03:33:35,520
different timeline of the different uh

5932
03:33:35,520 --> 03:33:38,960
expansion and so on so then i will have

5933
03:33:38,960 --> 03:33:42,239
one of my i will it will be published

5934
03:33:42,239 --> 03:33:42,880
again

5935
03:33:42,880 --> 03:33:45,210
with the uh with the data

5936
03:33:45,210 --> 03:33:46,720
[Music]

5937
03:33:46,720 --> 03:33:48,880
if it's a collaboration i would say in

5938
03:33:48,880 --> 03:33:50,080
the same team

5939
03:33:50,080 --> 03:33:52,800
that's a thing so it's sometimes it's

5940
03:33:52,800 --> 03:33:53,359
it's

5941
03:33:53,359 --> 03:33:55,120
people are working on the same event and

5942
03:33:55,120 --> 03:33:57,439
publishing it sometimes they are

5943
03:33:57,439 --> 03:33:59,359
sharing it and doing additional

5944
03:33:59,359 --> 03:34:01,359
expansion on the uh

5945
03:34:01,359 --> 03:34:04,880
on the um things until to reach a

5946
03:34:04,880 --> 03:34:08,080
specific point that is like i would say

5947
03:34:08,080 --> 03:34:11,040
accessible or at least publishable in a

5948
03:34:11,040 --> 03:34:12,399
publishing state that is

5949
03:34:12,399 --> 03:34:16,000
acceptable by various people

5950
03:34:16,000 --> 03:34:18,319
now we can make proposal too so that

5951
03:34:18,319 --> 03:34:19,520
means

5952
03:34:19,520 --> 03:34:22,080
if we are again on a different with a

5953
03:34:22,080 --> 03:34:24,880
different organization

5954
03:34:24,880 --> 03:34:26,479
i don't know if in this example it will

5955
03:34:26,479 --> 03:34:28,080
work but i can

5956
03:34:28,080 --> 03:34:30,720
take do i have something interesting

5957
03:34:30,720 --> 03:34:32,880
there

5958
03:34:33,760 --> 03:34:35,359
yeah for example i see an interesting

5959
03:34:35,359 --> 03:34:37,680
ipl

5960
03:34:37,840 --> 03:34:41,279
this one so what i could do is

5961
03:34:41,279 --> 03:34:43,840
i could

5962
03:34:44,399 --> 03:34:46,720
add

5963
03:34:49,600 --> 03:34:52,479
what's going on here

5964
03:34:53,040 --> 03:34:57,040
i will add what

5965
03:35:04,160 --> 03:35:10,800
okay just a demo effect

5966
03:35:10,800 --> 03:35:14,000
it's a great typical

5967
03:35:14,000 --> 03:35:18,239
what's going on here okay

5968
03:35:19,439 --> 03:35:21,600
just going back to this one i just want

5969
03:35:21,600 --> 03:35:25,040
to add a proposal

5970
03:35:25,040 --> 03:35:28,000
yes i cannot just

5971
03:35:28,960 --> 03:35:33,200
you wanted but your admin yeah

5972
03:35:33,200 --> 03:35:35,840
yeah then i don't you can cheat whether

5973
03:35:35,840 --> 03:35:36,479
you

5974
03:35:36,479 --> 03:35:38,479
really want you can do it yeah wait fine

5975
03:35:38,479 --> 03:35:40,000
it's just like okay so

5976
03:35:40,000 --> 03:35:43,040
i i don't know for for hong kong if we

5977
03:35:43,040 --> 03:35:44,800
answer your question but i mean

5978
03:35:44,800 --> 03:35:47,840
a full-blown step would be like that if

5979
03:35:47,840 --> 03:35:49,520
you work on an event it's not a single

5980
03:35:49,520 --> 03:35:50,560
person obviously

5981
03:35:50,560 --> 03:35:52,399
when you do an investigation you do like

5982
03:35:52,399 --> 03:35:54,239
multiple steps but the question is more

5983
03:35:54,239 --> 03:35:54,800
like

5984
03:35:54,800 --> 03:35:56,880
if you do it within a team usually you

5985
03:35:56,880 --> 03:35:58,800
edit the current even the same

5986
03:35:58,800 --> 03:36:00,000
organizations

5987
03:36:00,000 --> 03:36:03,520
if you do enter team you do proposal

5988
03:36:03,520 --> 03:36:05,760
extend it even like we showed before and

5989
03:36:05,760 --> 03:36:07,680
then you start to work on this uh

5990
03:36:07,680 --> 03:36:09,359
thing so it's here depending on the case

5991
03:36:09,359 --> 03:36:11,279
so uh

5992
03:36:11,279 --> 03:36:13,600
so i hope you can you can you can see

5993
03:36:13,600 --> 03:36:15,680
what are the capabilities there but it's

5994
03:36:15,680 --> 03:36:18,319
really uh the progressive approach of

5995
03:36:18,319 --> 03:36:20,399
collaboration usually depends of

5996
03:36:20,399 --> 03:36:22,560
how people are working together if they

5997
03:36:22,560 --> 03:36:24,479
are really external it's more proposal

5998
03:36:24,479 --> 03:36:25,680
extended event

5999
03:36:25,680 --> 03:36:28,080
if it's within the same team it could be

6000
03:36:28,080 --> 03:36:29,279
extended event

6001
03:36:29,279 --> 03:36:31,439
or within the same event that's usually

6002
03:36:31,439 --> 03:36:33,920
the two way of working

6003
03:36:33,920 --> 03:36:37,120
if you want to add something no yeah

6004
03:36:37,120 --> 03:36:39,680
that's perfect

6005
03:36:39,760 --> 03:36:42,640
perhaps another question if you're okay

6006
03:36:42,640 --> 03:36:43,279
with

6007
03:36:43,279 --> 03:36:46,720
switching yeah when speaking of feeding

6008
03:36:46,720 --> 03:36:48,000
tools what would be the automatic

6009
03:36:48,000 --> 03:36:49,840
way of doing it so normally when we're

6010
03:36:49,840 --> 03:36:51,120
talking about feeding tools there are

6011
03:36:51,120 --> 03:36:52,640
two separate ways of doing it and we'll

6012
03:36:52,640 --> 03:36:54,720
go way way deeper into this tomorrow

6013
03:36:54,720 --> 03:36:56,160
when we talk about integration but

6014
03:36:56,160 --> 03:36:58,239
generally tools can either fetch data

6015
03:36:58,239 --> 03:36:58,960
from miss

6016
03:36:58,960 --> 03:37:00,560
so this is a more common way where a

6017
03:37:00,560 --> 03:37:02,800
tool would use rest search api that we

6018
03:37:02,800 --> 03:37:05,120
mentioned before where you define yours

6019
03:37:05,120 --> 03:37:07,279
your search patterns for example give me

6020
03:37:07,279 --> 03:37:09,040
everything that is newer than

6021
03:37:09,040 --> 03:37:12,160
30 days everything that uh that contains

6022
03:37:12,160 --> 03:37:12,880
at least

6023
03:37:12,880 --> 03:37:15,760
that is not coming from say oh since the

6024
03:37:15,760 --> 03:37:16,399
sources

6025
03:37:16,399 --> 03:37:18,720
or perhaps not something nothing that

6026
03:37:18,720 --> 03:37:19,600
comes

6027
03:37:19,600 --> 03:37:21,760
uh related to a certain topic for

6028
03:37:21,760 --> 03:37:23,520
example i'm not interested in ransomware

6029
03:37:23,520 --> 03:37:25,600
when feeding my tools just a stupid

6030
03:37:25,600 --> 03:37:26,399
example

6031
03:37:26,399 --> 03:37:28,640
so you set up your filter options and

6032
03:37:28,640 --> 03:37:30,160
then your tool would fetch

6033
03:37:30,160 --> 03:37:32,319
data from misp every 60 minutes for

6034
03:37:32,319 --> 03:37:33,680
example

6035
03:37:33,680 --> 03:37:36,160
and then replace the data set there you

6036
03:37:36,160 --> 03:37:37,359
can also do

6037
03:37:37,359 --> 03:37:40,319
sliding time window searches where you

6038
03:37:40,319 --> 03:37:42,080
say give me everything from the past 60

6039
03:37:42,080 --> 03:37:43,760
minutes that is new

6040
03:37:43,760 --> 03:37:45,359
and then you keep concatenating your

6041
03:37:45,359 --> 03:37:48,000
data set on the seam side ids side

6042
03:37:48,000 --> 03:37:49,040
whatever tool you're

6043
03:37:49,040 --> 03:37:51,200
feeding the alternative if you want to

6044
03:37:51,200 --> 03:37:52,880
have the data push automatically as it

6045
03:37:52,880 --> 03:37:53,680
comes in

6046
03:37:53,680 --> 03:37:55,200
you have different channels and mist

6047
03:37:55,200 --> 03:37:57,040
that your tools can latch on to

6048
03:37:57,040 --> 03:37:58,560
the downside being that you still need

6049
03:37:58,560 --> 03:38:00,720
to do the conversion

6050
03:38:00,720 --> 03:38:03,200
in those cases so if you were not using

6051
03:38:03,200 --> 03:38:04,960
the

6052
03:38:04,960 --> 03:38:08,160
the apis to fetch the data from bisp

6053
03:38:08,160 --> 03:38:11,200
then mis can push using the miss json

6054
03:38:11,200 --> 03:38:11,680
format

6055
03:38:11,680 --> 03:38:13,680
data down via different channels serum

6056
03:38:13,680 --> 03:38:16,000
queue

6057
03:38:16,080 --> 03:38:19,279
or the kafka channel or this blog and so

6058
03:38:19,279 --> 03:38:19,760
on

6059
03:38:19,760 --> 03:38:21,279
and then your tools automatically feed

6060
03:38:21,279 --> 03:38:23,040
on that data so you have these two

6061
03:38:23,040 --> 03:38:24,000
different

6062
03:38:24,000 --> 03:38:26,399
ways of interacting with it there's also

6063
03:38:26,399 --> 03:38:27,520
a third way

6064
03:38:27,520 --> 03:38:28,960
where you can basically either build an

6065
03:38:28,960 --> 03:38:31,760
export module or an enrichment module

6066
03:38:31,760 --> 03:38:34,000
where an analyst can trigger a direct

6067
03:38:34,000 --> 03:38:35,760
push of a certain data point

6068
03:38:35,760 --> 03:38:38,560
to another tool so that's another option

6069
03:38:38,560 --> 03:38:39,920
we'll talk about these different

6070
03:38:39,920 --> 03:38:41,840
strategies when to use which

6071
03:38:41,840 --> 03:38:45,199
which and how to mix those tomorrow more

6072
03:38:45,199 --> 03:38:49,199
so i hope that answers it in a

6073
03:38:49,199 --> 03:38:52,399
brief fashion yeah what i'm showing here

6074
03:38:52,399 --> 03:38:54,160
is it's just like

6075
03:38:54,160 --> 03:38:57,840
on the on the rest uh search client

6076
03:38:57,840 --> 03:38:59,359
for example you want to feed your your

6077
03:38:59,359 --> 03:39:01,760
storikata and so on uh just

6078
03:39:01,760 --> 03:39:04,800
take page um

6079
03:39:04,800 --> 03:39:09,840
on a specific limit

6080
03:39:13,359 --> 03:39:15,600
so what you can do is if you have a

6081
03:39:15,600 --> 03:39:17,199
python script and so on you can pull

6082
03:39:17,199 --> 03:39:19,120
directly the data so

6083
03:39:19,120 --> 03:39:22,160
the rest client so you see in this case

6084
03:39:22,160 --> 03:39:23,199
i have the

6085
03:39:23,199 --> 03:39:26,160
shurikata rule set but if you want to

6086
03:39:26,160 --> 03:39:26,880
feed your

6087
03:39:26,880 --> 03:39:29,359
specific tools and and so on uh

6088
03:39:29,359 --> 03:39:31,359
automatically we are generating

6089
03:39:31,359 --> 03:39:34,960
uh curl and python card so it could be a

6090
03:39:34,960 --> 03:39:36,399
bootstrap to see okay

6091
03:39:36,399 --> 03:39:38,640
how should i create my own tool for

6092
03:39:38,640 --> 03:39:41,120
feeding my ideas and so on uh for for

6093
03:39:41,120 --> 03:39:42,640
study cata for example

6094
03:39:42,640 --> 03:39:44,399
a lot of management interface have

6095
03:39:44,399 --> 03:39:45,840
already missed connector

6096
03:39:45,840 --> 03:39:47,760
so you can even like feed the data

6097
03:39:47,760 --> 03:39:49,120
directly from

6098
03:39:49,120 --> 03:39:51,600
the from the interface if they have the

6099
03:39:51,600 --> 03:39:52,319
ability

6100
03:39:52,319 --> 03:39:54,720
splunk for example there's a specific

6101
03:39:54,720 --> 03:39:56,640
application

6102
03:39:56,640 --> 03:40:00,080
which is an external tools part of the

6103
03:40:00,080 --> 03:40:02,800
app store of splunk that you can install

6104
03:40:02,800 --> 03:40:04,080
for doing the connection

6105
03:40:04,080 --> 03:40:05,760
and some other people are using their

6106
03:40:05,760 --> 03:40:08,640
own python script to feed other cm

6107
03:40:08,640 --> 03:40:12,160
so again it's a matter of taste

6108
03:40:12,160 --> 03:40:14,239
if you are curious about the different

6109
03:40:14,239 --> 03:40:16,000
kind of integrations

6110
03:40:16,000 --> 03:40:18,080
or you can do it in python for example

6111
03:40:18,080 --> 03:40:20,080
in on payments

6112
03:40:20,080 --> 03:40:24,080
itself there are plenty of examples

6113
03:40:24,080 --> 03:40:26,479
so if you go in the example directory of

6114
03:40:26,479 --> 03:40:28,960
palmist

6115
03:40:30,800 --> 03:40:34,800
you have a quite significant

6116
03:40:34,800 --> 03:40:38,000
set of default scripts

6117
03:40:38,000 --> 03:40:41,439
that you can use uh and that's uh

6118
03:40:41,439 --> 03:40:43,040
i think usually a good basis if you want

6119
03:40:43,040 --> 03:40:46,160
to start to to write your own custom

6120
03:40:46,160 --> 03:40:48,720
custom tool set for for feeding your

6121
03:40:48,720 --> 03:40:49,520
feeding

6122
03:40:49,520 --> 03:40:51,279
systems or existing software in your

6123
03:40:51,279 --> 03:40:53,920
infrastructure

6124
03:40:57,199 --> 03:41:01,680
yep um

6125
03:41:01,680 --> 03:41:03,760
i don't know if it's if we should jump

6126
03:41:03,760 --> 03:41:05,359
on a new topic or we just push the

6127
03:41:05,359 --> 03:41:07,600
copalos example for tomorrow

6128
03:41:07,600 --> 03:41:10,479
yeah i think i think uh we can we can do

6129
03:41:10,479 --> 03:41:12,080
it maybe tomorrow i think

6130
03:41:12,080 --> 03:41:14,399
if we can i think that would be

6131
03:41:14,399 --> 03:41:15,920
stretching it a little bit if we were to

6132
03:41:15,920 --> 03:41:17,520
start with that yeah

6133
03:41:17,520 --> 03:41:21,040
so um quick quick summary of today so

6134
03:41:21,040 --> 03:41:22,000
today we we

6135
03:41:22,000 --> 03:41:25,040
show uh how to create an event the basis

6136
03:41:25,040 --> 03:41:26,080
of misplay

6137
03:41:26,080 --> 03:41:28,319
what is an attribute an object and so on

6138
03:41:28,319 --> 03:41:29,840
how to create it so to

6139
03:41:29,840 --> 03:41:32,960
make proposal delete uh and and and

6140
03:41:32,960 --> 03:41:34,080
stuff like that

6141
03:41:34,080 --> 03:41:36,239
so it's really a simple example tomorrow

6142
03:41:36,239 --> 03:41:37,840
we want to show you

6143
03:41:37,840 --> 03:41:40,640
more the uh even report aspect and the

6144
03:41:40,640 --> 03:41:42,640
automatic imports into

6145
03:41:42,640 --> 03:41:45,439
into mist with a practical example of an

6146
03:41:45,439 --> 03:41:46,880
ocean report

6147
03:41:46,880 --> 03:41:49,920
and we will discuss tomorrow about

6148
03:41:49,920 --> 03:41:51,439
how to build sharing communities and

6149
03:41:51,439 --> 03:41:53,040
especially we will share

6150
03:41:53,040 --> 03:41:55,840
our experience of things that worked and

6151
03:41:55,840 --> 03:41:57,279
things that didn't work

6152
03:41:57,279 --> 03:41:59,520
uh in the past years when creating

6153
03:41:59,520 --> 03:42:01,359
sharing communities so if you are

6154
03:42:01,359 --> 03:42:03,040
isaac members or creating your own

6155
03:42:03,040 --> 03:42:04,479
sharing community even within your

6156
03:42:04,479 --> 03:42:05,600
organization

6157
03:42:05,600 --> 03:42:07,040
uh it's it's something good to

6158
03:42:07,040 --> 03:42:09,040
participate because you we will share

6159
03:42:09,040 --> 03:42:10,560
with you some some of the things that
