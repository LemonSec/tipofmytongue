1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,720
russian uh thanks first for uh allowing

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,199
me to

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,839
come and provide uh this information to

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,200
uh its attendees

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,639
at this workshop uh so this workshop is

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,880
on building a successful abuse desk

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,559
uh the training will focus on what the

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,880
team's role will be what you look for in

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,000
team members

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,600
how incidents are generated and

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,439
processed and finally what the results

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,000
of the abuse desk should look like

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,519
from there we'll discuss the human

14
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,599
factor of your team what to look for in

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:28,840
team members

16
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,320
and overall just uh the results that you

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,000
should look for

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,480
uh my name is seven walker i am the

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,480
messaging malware and mobile anti-abuse

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,360
working groups

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,640
board co-chair uh so

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,239
first off let's get into what mog is

23
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,200
specifically

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,480
advanced slide there we go so a real

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,320
short introduction to mog for those who

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,160
aren't familiar with uh

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,960
our organization uh like first we are a

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,800
global organization

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,000
um and so i if for whatever reason

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,280
i uh cover a slide too quickly or

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,640
there's a term that i use

32
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,400
that uh you know isn't universally

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,799
understood feel free to also use the q

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,040
a box to ask for clarification

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,880
we'll take a couple of points to stop

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,799
and cover some of the q a

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,479
questions as well throughout the

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,560
discussion and there will be time at the

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,240
end to cover that

40
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,280
so mog was founded in 2004 uh and it's

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,799
where the industry comes together to

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,240
work against botnets

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,079
malware spam viruses denial of service

44
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,920
attacks and other online uh

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,320
exploitation like i mentioned we are a

46
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,000
global organization

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,759
with 260 member companies worldwide

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,439
we hold three meetings a year and

49
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,680
typically uh those meetings have

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,880
300 400 conference participants

51
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,479
we've had similar numbers for our

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,159
virtual meetings in the past year as

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,079
well

54
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,880
so what does mog do we develop and

55
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,560
publish best practice papers

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,119
uh we also comment on position

57
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,439
statements if there's a regulations

58
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,959
or calls for comment from different

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,840
governing bodies or organizations like i

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,040
can

61
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,800
we produce training and educational

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,959
videos and work with our partners

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,959
to do the same much like today's

64
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,400
workshop

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,120
we're not a lobbying group we just uh

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,599
speak

67
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,160
as a non-profit voice for the industry

68
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,840
so first uh let's start with the term

69
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,360
abuse desk itself

70
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,319
we'll get into the workshop here so

71
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,319
abuse desk is not necessarily the common

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,319
term used in every organization

73
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,280
or every region of the world some

74
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,120
companies may call it the compliance

75
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,920
department

76
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,720
because of its responsibility to ensure

77
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,840
regulatory or

78
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,360
policy compliance uh some organizations

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,840
may opt to use the incident response

80
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,080
uh we know first you know that's part of

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,159
the name here for example

82
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,239
uh and this is you know uh for

83
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,239
organizations who interact directly with

84
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:06,959
consumers

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,040
um they may be wary of the word abuse

86
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,959
itself and believe it's not a positive

87
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,760
word to use with their

88
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,000
customers

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,440
it's important to know that the nature

90
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,959
of an incident response team is

91
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,480
generally understood to be different

92
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,280
than an i.t

93
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,760
security context than an abuse desk so

94
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,159
abuse desk maybe more customer facing

95
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,959
may be more

96
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,519
regulatory or compliance whereas your

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,760
i.t security team may be

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,120
looking at the edge of firewalls and

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,480
attacks against the network

100
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,200
infrastructure

101
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,640
one thing i'd like to hear from the

102
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,959
audience today is other variations that

103
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,480
you've heard on this term

104
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,400
and perhaps what you call it in your own

105
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,200
organization

106
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,480
for the sake of the training we'll

107
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,159
continue to refer to the operation as

108
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,280
the abuse desk though

109
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,200
when creating a team if you don't

110
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,720
already have one or you're forming it

111
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,000
currently of course you're free to

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,480
consider

113
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,159
a department name that's appropriate to

114
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,680
the work that you perform

115
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,439
uh who you interact with and what the

116
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,200
cultural norm is

117
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,519
so let's review the sections of training

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,238
included in the workshop today

119
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,759
first we'll cover the purpose of the

120
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,479
department and how this is a justifiable

121
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,400
investment for any service provider to

122
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
engage in that will bring us to the

123
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,759
abused

124
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,720
incidents themselves these are the items

125
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,680
that the department

126
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,160
must work through we discuss the

127
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,919
complete typical life cycle of an

128
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:38,479
incident

129
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,479
involving one of your customers with

130
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,560
suggestions on where efficiencies

131
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,120
and automation can play a role next

132
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,560
we'll review the composition of the

133
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,919
abuse desk team

134
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,600
how you maintain employee skills and

135
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,120
well-being in light of some of the

136
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,639
stress that they may endure as part of

137
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,160
the role

138
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,680
and finally we'll look at the potential

139
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,000
results in the output of an abuse desk

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
tying it back to the business

141
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,440
justification that'll be your

142
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,360
opportunity to reflect the return on

143
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,120
investment made by your business or

144
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
organization

145
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,360
so the purpose of the abuse desk

146
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,680
most segments of the communications

147
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,479
industry

148
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,880
have a responsibility for some sort of

149
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,400
anti-abuse

150
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,240
you're responsible to you know protect

151
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,759
the internet from your customers and

152
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,360
protect your customers from threats on

153
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,800
the internet

154
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,479
uh as providers we have the

155
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,560
responsibility to build a safer web

156
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,440
experience

157
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,360
for our customers as the industry

158
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,280
matures other providers such as social

159
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,600
media and video game services even

160
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
have also had to consider how they

161
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,840
respond to policy and security incidents

162
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,119
involving their users

163
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,280
so if we look at a phishing attack and

164
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,880
how that can impact

165
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,120
many segments of the industry we start

166
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,000
with

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,240
security vendor in this case as they can

168
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
typically have a holistic view

169
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,080
of an attack from multiple customer

170
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,600
sources

171
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,840
this type of investigation and reporting

172
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,960
follow-up

173
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,639
could come from any of the sectors

174
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,880
though

175
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,880
so the team that detected the phishing

176
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,800
will likely send instant reports to the

177
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
email and mailbox service providers

178
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,639
where the phishing email originated from

179
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,360
they may also send an incident response

180
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,960
to the hosting service provider where

181
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,560
the fake websites linked to

182
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,240
in the email were being hosted

183
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,240
finally because of botnets and other

184
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,680
malware infections

185
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,160
that can occur within cut and consumer

186
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,120
detections

187
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,800
they will also have the need to notify

188
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,880
isps of their customers involvement in

189
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,520
the attacks

190
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
that's just one example of collaboration

191
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,560
across the industry between abuse desks

192
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
but with proper insight into your

193
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,400
customer incidents critical incident

194
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,840
information and feedback can help

195
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,758
empower everyone's policy decisions

196
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,800
so if we talk about the business

197
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,960
justification of an abuse desk

198
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,039
we all understand that proper processing

199
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,720
of incident reports when it comes to

200
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,240
your organization's policies is

201
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,280
important

202
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,520
it may be difficult though to justify

203
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
that need to those in your organization

204
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,280
that are making business and financial

205
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,800
decisions

206
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,639
in the following section we'll discuss

207
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,479
how to quantify the importance of an

208
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,759
abuse desk

209
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,840
and how it can make financial sense to

210
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,799
support one as well

211
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
so your brand is what identifies your

212
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
organization as being distinct from

213
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,080
other organizations a trusted brand

214
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,000
ensures customers and industry partners

215
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
have confidence in your company

216
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,639
and its services so aside from the

217
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,720
concept of reputation a successful brand

218
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,479
can reap the rewards of increased

219
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,360
adoption

220
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,039
efficiencies gained when working with

221
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,720
other industry members

222
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,800
retention of satisfied customers and

223
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,280
employee retention gains

224
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,280
so by being a successful abuse desk

225
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,639
department i

226
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,120
you can definitely have a variety of

227
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,319
benefits

228
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,039
um you know that are listed out here on

229
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,599
this slide

230
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,560
uh so a security incident response team

231
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,639
is typically justified because it can

232
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,080
help protect from

233
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,560
loss from the misuse of equipment or a

234
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,919
loss of data

235
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,840
meanwhile an abuse desk plays a similar

236
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,080
role but also protects the company from

237
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,560
fines resulting in a lack of regulatory

238
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,800
compliance or refund losses from

239
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,639
customers having a poor experience

240
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,360
legal investigations require precious

241
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,958
time and money of course

242
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,880
an abuse desk must understand and adhere

243
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,200
to regulations in order to avoid

244
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,159
costly fines so for example in the

245
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,440
united states

246
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,360
there's been internet service providers

247
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,640
who have seen fines

248
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,959
of over 25 million dollars from the

249
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:49,680
courts

250
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,839
for not acting on copyright infringement

251
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,600
notifications

252
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,720
so that's a regulatory

253
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,839
requirement of an isp that

254
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,880
passed legislation over 20 years ago and

255
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,360
has a monetary value attached to it that

256
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,279
an abuse desk can protect

257
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,560
the isp from by being a successful abuse

258
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,880
desk

259
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,920
every region has their own laws that may

260
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,160
govern your organization of course

261
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,760
it's important to consult your legal and

262
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,440
government affairs staff on a regular

263
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,120
basis to ensure your operation

264
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,440
is prepared for incidents relevant to

265
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,959
the regional requirements

266
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,680
uh for example um you know canada has

267
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,120
anti-spam laws

268
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,040
the japanese government has a number of

269
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,839
regulations uh that the abuse desk can

270
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,279
play a part in

271
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,320
making sure they are compliant uh within

272
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,839
the united states again

273
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,600
we have a number of states now with

274
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,399
privacy laws similar to the gdpr

275
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,560
in europe uh and so if you operate

276
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,240
within those states

277
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,839
you know your abuse desk has to be

278
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,000
responsible for responding to

279
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,600
those regulatory incidents

280
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,880
so it's not just true for consumer isps

281
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,360
but also hosting providers as well

282
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,760
they are subject to some of the content

283
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,959
or copyright infringement

284
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,959
responsibilities seen

285
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,200
in the united states and in other

286
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,959
regions of the world

287
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,560
so when considering the charter of your

288
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
abuse desk team and how it enforces

289
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,279
compliance

290
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,040
you have to consider what services are

291
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,800
provided on the equipment your company

292
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,760
owns and operates

293
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,240
so building a robust abuse operation uh

294
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,279
that acts upon

295
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,959
the threats before they have an impact

296
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,959
on your network results in a faster more

297
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,800
reliable experience for your customers

298
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,839
as well

299
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,680
uh most companies would rather be known

300
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,279
for the integrity of their network

301
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,000
instead of

302
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,399
instability and poor ip reputation of

303
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
their mail servers for example

304
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,279
continued abuse mitigation ensures that

305
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,880
the quality of your network becomes a

306
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,560
marketable selling point to new and

307
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,640
existing customers

308
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,440
for services offering shared resources

309
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,000
such as

310
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
an email sending platform or a social

311
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,360
media platform

312
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,920
outbound ips or a cloud service uh

313
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,959
virtual system

314
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,680
uh the impact of unmitigated abuse to

315
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,959
other customers can

316
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,640
be readily apparent so by not

317
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,480
responding to incidents on one customer

318
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,959
that ip reputation

319
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,880
may affect several other customers who

320
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,800
share the outbound traffic with it

321
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,399
maintaining secure internet experience

322
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,560
is a daunting task for most consumers

323
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,079
and companies that take security

324
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,000
incidents seriously earn their customers

325
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,440
trust

326
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,200
if we attempt to educate and empower our

327
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,720
customers they will become more

328
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,360
knowledgeable

329
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,000
and less acceptable to threats this will

330
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,680
minimize their need for continuous

331
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,519
support

332
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,760
so i'm going to stop there that's the

333
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
end of the business justification

334
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,399
uh information uh and now we'll get into

335
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,240
incident processing

336
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,000
but just a reminder if you do have any

337
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,519
questions uh or

338
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,200
yeah i covered something you know maybe

339
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,880
too quickly or um

340
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,040
it wasn't clear enough uh feel free to

341
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,360
use the q a box uh here in the zoom

342
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,839
user interface

343
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,839
all right so let's talk about the

344
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,600
incidents that the abuse desk handles

345
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,839
so if we consider incidents as phases of

346
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,200
an overall cycle

347
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,279
the five stages comprise the incidence

348
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,480
from their generation

349
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,240
through resolution and hopefully some

350
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
insight gained into your operation by

351
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,680
the end of the cycle

352
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,199
before detection begins again

353
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,320
so the first step of detection is

354
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,079
identifying the source of your abuse

355
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:40,720
data

356
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,240
uh the majority of these will likely

357
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,000
come from third-party sources and data

358
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,040
feeds

359
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,320
but can also come from your own

360
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,760
operations and platform monitoring tools

361
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,399
so as we see here some of your security

362
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,600
monitoring may uh

363
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
generate incidents uh

364
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,519
customers may report incidents to you uh

365
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,040
and then of course there's third party

366
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,240
sources

367
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,639
many of them are intel and data feed

368
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,320
sources that are first members for

369
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,600
example

370
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,680
where you can subscribe and gain

371
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,279
incident data from them

372
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:20,079
for your department to act on

373
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,920
and we did receive a question about the

374
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,519
recording being made available for

375
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,800
review later uh

376
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
it will be so if there's a part that you

377
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,240
missed or you want to

378
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,800
review that will be available to you

379
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,560
thank you

380
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,200
so uh looking at example incidents uh

381
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,639
through the detection phase

382
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,320
an abuse desk must be able to take

383
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,560
public information such as an ip address

384
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,279
or domain

385
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,320
and refer it to a specific subscriber or

386
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,800
device that they are responsible for

387
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,240
this will come with a variety of

388
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,839
corresponding evidence concerning the

389
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,920
violation or attempted attack from the

390
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,240
source

391
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,959
so as we see here um again copyright

392
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,720
infringement notifications firewall

393
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,000
alarms or or

394
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
denial of service attacks um you know

395
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,680
these are all example incidents that an

396
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:17,839
abuse desk may handle

397
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,680
there we go so during the reporting

398
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,240
phase

399
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
uh important metadata is extracted and

400
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,800
compiled into a machine readable format

401
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,959
this data can be acted upon or sent to

402
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,000
the abuse desk

403
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
responsible to the source so

404
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,279
you know the data that really is

405
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,040
required for most incidents should

406
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,959
include the incident time stamp and

407
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,040
with the time zone and we'll get into

408
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,160
why that's important

409
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,440
shortly the source so mailbox ip and

410
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,079
domain

411
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,360
incident details um so the firewall logs

412
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,399
the the copyrighted content information

413
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,320
um so many of you have probably seen a

414
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,680
firewall incident

415
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,880
or have had to uh respond to one so they

416
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,160
typically

417
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,480
contain the ip source so where did the

418
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,680
attack come from

419
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,959
the attempted network activity so what

420
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,040
destination port did they attempt access

421
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,240
on

422
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,839
what type of uh you know uh

423
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,320
packet how many packets were sent et

424
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,360
cetera

425
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,079
um and the time stamp from the event log

426
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,839
meanwhile phishing messages contain

427
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,120
similar information

428
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,959
but you know because fishing is a

429
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,480
different type of attack it may

430
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,759
also include urls for ip hosts and

431
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,759
involve domains

432
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,000
and so we'll get into how this feeds

433
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,800
into

434
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,800
you know potential automation shortly

435
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,480
there is some reporting etiquette to

436
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,320
consider um

437
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,360
so in order to facilitate collaborative

438
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,240
relationships

439
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,800
when reporting incidents to other abuse

440
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,079
operations

441
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,920
you can't assume that you're a trusted

442
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,600
reporter that will get results on a

443
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,000
single

444
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,040
complaint right away uh con contact

445
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
information for security incidents can

446
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,120
often be found on a website support or

447
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,639
about page

448
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,880
additionally if the domain ownership is

449
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,759
unclear

450
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,279
it may be valuable to start by

451
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,959
contacting the hosting provider for the

452
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,880
ipa resolves to

453
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,720
this can typically be found in the ip

454
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
registry relevant to the region of

455
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,240
course

456
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,839
when considering sensitive data about

457
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,680
your customers and how much should be

458
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,639
redacted

459
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,880
you need to contact your organization's

460
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,720
policy regarding distribution

461
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,120
and retention of the various values

462
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,720
along with consideration of where the

463
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,360
report is and could go to

464
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,839
so things like account numbers pii etc

465
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,360
you know you will need to work with your

466
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,959
legal department to clear

467
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,560
you know what's being reported what's

468
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,800
made available

469
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,600
customer status and in a lot of areas

470
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,800
you can't even report

471
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,480
that you know you've identified the

472
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,000
customer let alone that you may

473
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
have turned their service off and so

474
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,320
these are things that you'll want to

475
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,360
clear with both the policies in you know

476
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:05,199
legal department within your org

477
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,319
so uh one way to uh efficiently report

478
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:08,720
uh

479
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,880
phishing incidents in particular um the

480
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,799
apwg provides

481
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,520
a method uh to pro to report phishing

482
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,880
messages or or just the urls themselves

483
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,400
forwarding the phishing email as an

484
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,160
attachment allows them to inspect the

485
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,799
header details and other information

486
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,199
alternatively you can use the web form

487
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,919
on the apwg's reporting page

488
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,200
or plan with a pwg to submit your urls

489
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,160
in bulk um

490
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,679
you know they're very easy to work with

491
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,520
and you know they

492
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,919
want to get the data and and process it

493
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:40,720
um

494
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,720
to ensure that incidents are responded

495
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,919
to uh so they will work with you on that

496
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,679
from there they collate all the phishing

497
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,320
urls they receive and make a feed of the

498
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,880
data

499
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,720
available to its members who will

500
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,559
typically ingest the data for incident

501
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,840
response

502
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,320
so this is another feed for you know an

503
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,039
isp

504
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,520
or a hosting provider to potentially

505
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,280
detect new incidents to bring new

506
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,000
incidents in

507
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,600
into the abuse desk so that could

508
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,760
include taking down a malicious url or

509
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,840
removing a shortened url redirection

510
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,760
so let's discuss how an operation can

511
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
take in incidents to remediate abuse

512
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,440
that their network or platform is

513
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,600
responsible for

514
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,679
in many operations the abuse desk staff

515
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,679
will manually process reports directly

516
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,000
from the inbox they were sent to

517
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,080
importing the information and enriching

518
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,760
it with a variety of tools for the next

519
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,320
phases

520
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,520
of the incident life cycle so this

521
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,480
you know may look fairly familiar to a

522
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,000
number of you who are currently

523
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,520
working incidents or had worked

524
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,280
incidents for your organization in the

525
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,520
past a fairly simple view of it

526
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,280
the tools used by the abuse desk will

527
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,600
determine its ability to effectively

528
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,000
enforce

529
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,559
the policies of the organization so

530
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,320
you're only as good as the tools and

531
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
resources made available to your abuse

532
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,280
desk essentially

533
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,320
a mail client review incidents as they

534
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,000
are reported should allow for

535
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,840
searching for specific content strings

536
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,039
or reporters

537
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,039
allowing for multiple users to engage

538
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,720
without conflicting with each other's

539
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,000
work

540
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,080
meaning that you know you don't want

541
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,120
multiple

542
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,000
analysts retrieving the same email and

543
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,600
both of them working on it you know

544
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,280
causing a redundancy

545
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,240
in the work being done uh enforcing

546
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,160
organization security policies uh

547
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,720
means uh ensuring that only the proper

548
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,720
employee roles have access

549
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,200
uh this should not be an open mailbox

550
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,160
you know and

551
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,200
if there are more sensitive categories

552
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,960
of reports

553
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,200
enforcing access roles to those reports

554
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,720
specifically

555
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,799
and uh retaining email in accordance

556
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,559
with organizational policy so

557
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,080
some content may need to be kept

558
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,919
indefinitely for legal compliance

559
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,080
purposes for example

560
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,400
even if there is no legislative mandate

561
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
the organization may opt to keep reports

562
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,039
forever

563
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,120
in some cases in the event that they are

564
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,640
needed for

565
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,919
court evidence purposes

566
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,320
so subscriber identification uh let's

567
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,720
discuss what we mean by that

568
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,799
excuse me so upon receipt of an incident

569
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,280
report uh the responsible end user

570
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,440
device is determined by evaluating the

571
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,240
report metadata or content provided

572
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,400
so in this case an isp has received a

573
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,480
complaint about one of their subscriber

574
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,640
ip addresses being the source of a spam

575
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,960
email

576
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,880
so we have the source ip and the

577
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,760
timestamp of the incident

578
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,640
so why the timestamp is important is

579
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,000
many isps utilize

580
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,679
dynamic ip assignments and so the data

581
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,240
has to be

582
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,720
used and the timestamp used to identify

583
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,799
the specific account holder of the ip

584
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,640
address at the time that the email was

585
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,480
sent

586
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,320
this is why simply forwarding an email

587
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,679
and having your customers

588
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,640
forward not as an attachment but a

589
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,679
simple forward

590
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,880
is not effective you cannot identify the

591
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,640
customer based off that without the

592
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,080
email headers

593
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,919
for some platforms the ip address may be

594
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,679
shared by multiple clients

595
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,600
so while the timestamp may lend itself

596
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,960
to identifying

597
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,799
a unique user other data may be

598
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,880
necessary to review as well

599
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,960
uh values like the domain the email was

600
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,440
sent from a unique message id

601
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,200
or some sort of messaging campaign

602
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,120
identifier should be reviewed to provide

603
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,679
an

604
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,320
irrefutable irrefutable link to a

605
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,000
customer's account

606
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,679
an easy interface for the abuse desk

607
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,440
staff to query this information must

608
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,000
then be made

609
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,840
available so when you're thinking about

610
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,600
automation

611
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,679
thinking think about extracting these

612
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,640
fields

613
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,520
for your analysts you know in a quick

614
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,799
and easy fashion

615
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,120
instead of them scanning you know

616
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,720
multiple headers a day

617
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,760
although they may just have to do that

618
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,720
temporarily as well

619
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,000
so the same concept applies to most any

620
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,280
valid incident report

621
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
uh as mentioned before an abuse desk

622
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,919
must be able to take public information

623
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,240
such as an ip address or domain and link

624
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,159
it to a specific subscriber device that

625
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,440
they are responsible for

626
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,760
so again these same thing holds true for

627
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,960
firewall logs

628
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,960
the information should have consistent

629
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,559
fields that they can use

630
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,720
within their own internal networking

631
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,520
identification

632
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,000
so as an incident is processed by the

633
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,919
abuse desk tracking the information

634
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,520
gathered during the investigation

635
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,280
and the subsequent response of actions

636
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,360
taken as necessary

637
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,039
this requires a tool that at the very

638
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,960
least provides fields for the abuse desk

639
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,200
agents to input and store in a database

640
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,640
system

641
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,559
beyond that basic concept the tool could

642
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,000
also provide automation

643
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,080
and data enrichment functionality needed

644
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,159
to process the incident

645
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,600
there are several commercial and even

646
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,760
open source options available for these

647
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,000
before deciding on one the operation

648
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,200
must consider

649
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,799
important factors about current and

650
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,840
future demands

651
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,159
so having uh the history available

652
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,600
to your analysts to your efficiencies

653
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,960
analysts is definitely

654
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,039
a critical must have for any abuse desk

655
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,440
so what should you track uh as your

656
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,039
operation scales uh

657
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,760
the need of what needs to be tracked

658
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,360
should be based on a variety of data

659
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,039
points

660
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,960
all of which become more useful over

661
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,360
time as we discuss in a later section

662
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,760
analysis can be an effective tool for

663
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,840
adjusting policies and even reshaping

664
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:51,840
the abuse test model itself

665
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,679
so tracking your incidents may seem

666
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,760
inconsequential at first

667
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,080
you know many departments may think well

668
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,080
we processed it we took care of the

669
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,120
customer

670
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,799
you know now we can move on to the next

671
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,159
without you know storing this

672
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,520
information

673
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,120
there are a multitude of benefits that

674
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,559
come from documenting the work you've

675
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,360
done

676
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,240
listed here though

677
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,159
so the rest of the tools used as

678
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,320
examples here become more relevant in

679
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,480
the later incident phases as we'll now

680
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,440
discuss

681
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,840
so your account management system things

682
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,159
like client notification tools

683
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,080
or even internal policy reference

684
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,360
materials are all

685
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,279
critical components of an abuse desk

686
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,120
so there are three key criteria to keep

687
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,480
in mind when defining

688
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,559
enforcement guidelines these are

689
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,080
examples of incident

690
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,760
enforcement actions from an isp

691
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,320
perspective uh to demonstrate that not

692
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,400
all issues require the same response or

693
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,559
resources applied that's why

694
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,799
for every incident that comes in you're

695
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,720
not going to have the same automated

696
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,919
response

697
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,039
you'll need some way of determining what

698
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,559
type of incidents

699
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,320
how many times you've engaged with the

700
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,080
customer responsible

701
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,440
and an enforcement orchestration engine

702
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,000
of some sort some way of determining

703
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,480
what your company's policy is based off

704
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,760
the other two

705
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,320
criteria

706
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,880
in this example uh the offending party

707
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,720
was found to be hosting a phishing site

708
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,559
that contained a malware

709
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,960
executable the isp sent an email

710
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,279
notification for the first occurrence

711
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,640
and then for the second occurrence the

712
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,720
account was temporarily shut off due to

713
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,760
the repeat offenses this is this uh

714
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,440
example isps policy

715
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,520
your policies may be different um and

716
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,880
what you can do with the customer may

717
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,000
even be different depending

718
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,120
on local regulation

719
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,000
for that example though the offending

720
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,760
party did not take heed to previous

721
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,440
warnings and as a result the account was

722
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,400
terminated on the third offense

723
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,480
in another example an isp detected a

724
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,880
phishing message from a mailbox owner

725
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,320
it was their first offense therefore

726
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,919
they sent a notification

727
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,840
alerting them to a possible account

728
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,480
compromise

729
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,159
but because the mailbox owner has either

730
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,480
not re-secured the account or has become

731
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,840
compromised again

732
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,679
uh the isp had to suspend their

733
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,679
credentials forcing

734
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,000
engagement with technical support to

735
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,840
secure the account

736
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,799
the isp spoke with the mailbox owner and

737
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,400
they claim to have updated their

738
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,960
password but a third offense occurs and

739
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
the isp has to temporarily shut off the

740
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,840
customer services yet again

741
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,720
finally in this example an isp received

742
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,400
a court order from law enforcement

743
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,240
advising that illegal activity had

744
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,840
occurred at a customer's residence

745
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,760
utilizing the service

746
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,440
the account will be terminated due to a

747
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,200
violation of the terms of service

748
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,240
and the first occurrence

749
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,640
once you've defined a prescribed course

750
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,320
of action for each incident type you

751
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,760
should consider setting up response

752
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,360
times as well

753
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,279
the faster an incident is mitigated the

754
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,679
less risk it poses to the network

755
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,440
defined response times also allow you to

756
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,600
measure the success of your abuse team

757
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,039
and determine if you are staffed

758
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,120
appropriately or

759
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,880
are processing incidents efficiently

760
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,520
so these uh breaking these down

761
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,640
systematically

762
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,960
for the enforcement uh part of the life

763
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,840
cycle

764
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,240
also aids in being able to create an

765
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,360
automation engine

766
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,279
and simplifies the the requirements for

767
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,480
that automation engine

768
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,399
so although often overlooked defining

769
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,919
what we say and how we say it is a

770
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,440
critical component when designing a

771
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,520
remediation policy

772
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,279
we should provide our clients with

773
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,960
information regarding the incident

774
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,440
and set clear expectations on next steps

775
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,919
and what future violations could mean

776
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,080
many times account compromise or

777
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,360
computer infections

778
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,919
are done because the customer uh

779
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,320
was not as educated on uh computer

780
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,840
security as they should have been

781
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,200
so taking a more educational approach uh

782
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,520
keeping in mind the customer experience

783
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,840
uh could empower the customer to not be

784
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,039
become a repeat offender or

785
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,039
also helps just spread that information

786
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,799
maybe they help secure someone else's

787
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:21,600
account and

788
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
prevents them from being yet another

789
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,080
incident

790
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,080
so because companies should seek to

791
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,679
retain the customer while preventing

792
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,760
future incidents uh through education

793
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,960
like i said

794
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,039
uh the communication channel you use is

795
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,279
also dependent on the type of operation

796
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,880
so different mediums yield more

797
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,559
effective results

798
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,480
uh we'll cover some things to consider

799
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,399
as you choose what approach to take when

800
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,919
remediating an incident with the

801
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,360
customer

802
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,279
this information is taken from a concise

803
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,399
operator handbook

804
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,559
best practices to address online mobile

805
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,240
and telephony threads

806
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,399
authored by a collaboration from several

807
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,520
mog and london action plan members

808
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,480
the handbook's primarily focused on isps

809
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,000
internet service providers

810
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,440
but many of the concerns should be

811
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,440
relevant to most service or platform

812
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,120
providers

813
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,799
it's recommended that your organization

814
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,559
review the entirety of that best

815
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,840
practices document

816
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,919
these slides will be available to you so

817
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,520
you'll be able to get the link that's

818
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,120
listed here

819
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,880
but you know review that as a supplement

820
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,880
to this training as well

821
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,960
so per the handbook regarding your

822
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,799
communication attempt

823
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,200
quote the isp may notify the user by

824
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,840
email

825
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,679
unfortunately many time users never

826
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,679
check the email that the isp provides

827
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,720
for their use

828
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,360
and the user may never provide the isp

829
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,200
with the email address that they do

830
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,880
routinely use

831
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,039
users may also have become wary of

832
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,720
trusting email notifications

833
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,640
as a result of widespread phishing

834
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,799
attacks and tech support scams that

835
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,720
mislead consumers about the presence of

836
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,640
malware on their pcs

837
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,760
uh so you know for example uh

838
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,640
if you're a comcast internet subscriber

839
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,480
you may use a gmail account that you've

840
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:04,960
had

841
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,799
um you know for a number of years rather

842
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,120
than use the comcast.net account

843
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,880
that was provided to you for free from

844
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,960
the company

845
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
and so you'll never see the email

846
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
notification and if you never told the

847
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,080
isp that

848
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,399
you know you use your gmail account they

849
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,159
don't know the proper account to reach

850
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,000
out to you on and let you know that a

851
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,080
security incident occurred

852
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,399
which means it does not get addressed

853
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,840
and we'll see reoccurrence

854
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,520
when contacting customers this is again

855
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,440
from that handbook uh when contacting

856
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,039
customers it's important to consider

857
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,799
that while automated calling can be

858
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,760
efficient

859
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
users may be suspicious of phone based

860
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,240
notifications as a result of voice based

861
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,760
phishing attacks

862
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,039
on the other hand live phone

863
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,880
notification can be tedious and time

864
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,640
consuming if a large number infected

865
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,960
users need to be notified

866
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,320
so with email and telephone outreach

867
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,080
in both cases you have to build that

868
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,720
trust with your customer you have to

869
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,480
authenticate yourself as the service

870
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,320
provider much in the same way that you

871
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,159
expect them to authenticate themselves

872
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:08,799
as a

873
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,159
user using your services so how you do

874
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,919
that outreach how you present yourself

875
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,840
how you present your email domain

876
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,279
that all has to be taken into

877
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,960
consideration uh for

878
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,000
many of these uh communication mediums

879
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,720
um and then the other thing is you know

880
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,679
you have to keep in mind the scale

881
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,640
of the outreach so if a telephone call

882
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,159
takes on average

883
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,600
10 to 15 minutes do you want to contact

884
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,960
everyone who is

885
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,159
responsible for a minor infraction

886
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,799
for their first offense or maybe send

887
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,320
them something a little more automated

888
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,640
to start with and then see if

889
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,559
they take care of the issue at that

890
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,799
point

891
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,000
so from the handbook in cases where the

892
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,919
isp knows the mobile phone number of the

893
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,919
customer another option would be to push

894
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:00,399
text

895
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,440
message notifications to the user

896
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,679
um this requires knowing the specific

897
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,440
mobile contact number and that it is a

898
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,080
mobile

899
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,200
number this also uh

900
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,360
you know in a lot of countries around

901
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,399
the world sms

902
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,440
is unused or not trusted by the

903
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,679
the consumer so you have to take that

904
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,080
into account as well

905
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,360
in some cases this medium has moved on

906
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,039
to applications and so push

907
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:27,919
notifications

908
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,480
are used if the customer selects to

909
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,880
install the isp's uh specific

910
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,559
communication or customer support

911
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,200
application

912
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,380
[Music]

913
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,440
so paper mail so an isp may consider

914
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,519
notifying users via traditional postal

915
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,720
mail perhaps via an

916
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,039
insert into their monthly bill uh and

917
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,279
again that that's that trust uh

918
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,200
mechanism they expect to get the bill

919
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,480
from you and the note

920
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,120
the security notification or copyright

921
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,519
infringement notification is there

922
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,360
therefore you've slightly authenticated

923
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,960
that notification through

924
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,399
uh physical means however if the isp is

925
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,240
not already mailing the customer

926
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,399
doing ad hoc mail notifications may be

927
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,120
expensive and of limited effectiveness

928
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,039
especially if the user is predisposed to

929
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,519
discard mail communications unopened due

930
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,039
to a perception that they are just

931
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,559
likely marketing

932
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,840
so what this uh relates to is the fact

933
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,519
that a lot of companies have

934
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,799
moved on to paperless billing um so

935
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,720
you would be sending out a paper mail

936
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,399
notification from your company when

937
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,720
they're not used to sending it so

938
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
uh in the united states for copyright

939
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,840
infringements

940
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,760
for example um we

941
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,840
an isp is required to send a

942
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,679
notification

943
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,399
via u.s mail that the copyright

944
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,519
notification

945
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,960
incident occurred if that customer

946
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,120
uh doesn't get paper billing they may

947
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,880
just throw that away and not even open

948
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,760
the envelope

949
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,559
because they assume oh my cable company

950
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,240
or my isp is sending me

951
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,080
um you know an advertisement or or a new

952
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,719
new billing plan of some sort so you

953
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,079
have to keep that in mind

954
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,918
uh when developing your policy and

955
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,399
your policy when it comes to repeats

956
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,000
notifications

957
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,839
and how you do your outreach

958
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,399
so in situations where the user has

959
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,119
purchased an on-site support contract

960
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,119
another notification approach may be via

961
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,399
an in-person truck roll to the

962
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,159
customer's site

963
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,918
obviously the isp technician will need

964
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,839
to be able to satisfy the customer of

965
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,440
his or her credentials

966
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,119
and authenticate that they are indeed an

967
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,800
employee of the isp

968
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,679
and we also note that this can be very

969
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,159
expensive notification options so

970
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,800
this would not be this would probably be

971
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
a last resort for many companies

972
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,040
um something like you know you need to

973
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,399
address a

974
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,480
malware infected gateway in the home or

975
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,000
some other sort of device that you

976
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,320
provided the customer this would not be

977
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,880
an effective tool to notify customers

978
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,480
that they have a virus infection

979
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,760
on pc for example much less

980
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,160
you know the customer would probably not

981
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,960
want to

982
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,800
see a stranger telling them that they

983
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,440
have a virus on their computer

984
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,720
unexpectedly like that

985
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,800
so browser notification in this approach

986
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
and isp notifies the user

987
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,760
by interposing an interstitial message

988
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,520
when the user attempts to visit a normal

989
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,800
website

990
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,000
this approach can be somewhat

991
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,839
disconcerting for some users

992
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,760
but is less disruptive than some other

993
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,520
approaches such as the the next wallet

994
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,200
garden approach that we'll talk about in

995
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,800
a second

996
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,400
so browser notifications there's

997
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,960
documentation mog has best practices on

998
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,760
how to

999
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,119
apply uh browser notifications um the

1000
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,040
ietf has documentation

1001
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,400
on the means to do that but with a lot

1002
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,359
of the transition to

1003
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,800
tls encrypted uh http traffic

1004
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,680
uh and a lot of devices using http for

1005
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,400
things like

1006
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,520
video streaming this can be somewhat

1007
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,960
disruptive like they mentioned

1008
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,200
um and a customer may not see the

1009
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,560
notification

1010
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,000
uh right away instead they may suffer

1011
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,680
some sort of technical issue that they

1012
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,079
then

1013
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,400
end up calling into customer support

1014
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,359
anyhow

1015
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,200
to resolve so again you have to consider

1016
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,920
when is this appropriate and you know

1017
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,040
what what type of customers are

1018
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:40,480
being affected by it

1019
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,200
so if an isp needs to immediately limit

1020
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,079
the damage

1021
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,320
that an infected user can cause one

1022
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,920
option is to put them in a to a

1023
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
so-called walled garden

1024
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,359
this is if you can affect the

1025
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,599
gateway in their home essentially or the

1026
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,079
the modem that was provided to them

1027
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,760
so when this is done the user is allowed

1028
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,240
to access selected sites for remediation

1029
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,800
and hardening purposes and may perhaps

1030
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,320
be allowed to continue to have

1031
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,520
a voice over ip service for things like

1032
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,480
access to emergency services so e911 in

1033
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,520
the united states

1034
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,599
and similar services in other regions

1035
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,359
typically though the customer cannot

1036
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,920
access most other internet resources

1037
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,280
should be emphasized that

1038
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,720
this strategy is not meant to be

1039
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,320
punitive walled gardens have been

1040
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,000
extremely effective in diminishing the

1041
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,240
amount of infection at the consumer isp

1042
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,680
level

1043
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,760
so if you don't have specific ports

1044
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,200
blocked coming out of the

1045
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,480
customer home like port 25 but you do

1046
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,160
have the means to place the customer

1047
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,599
into a wad garden

1048
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,000
where you warned them that um you know

1049
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,520
you're temporarily cutting off their

1050
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,480
traffic

1051
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,520
until they you know click a

1052
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,200
you know confirmation that they've fixed

1053
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,560
the problem

1054
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,880
this can be very effective again you

1055
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,560
need to evaluate

1056
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,320
what policies you would use this for and

1057
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,400
you know how often you would apply it

1058
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,160
and is your customer service ready to

1059
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,960
take the

1060
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,200
troubleshooting calls when um when

1061
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,879
they're prompted with the wild garden

1062
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,359
so with that uh before we get into

1063
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,680
automation uh i want to give everybody a

1064
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,359
chance to take a five minute break i

1065
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,160
know we're all

1066
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,800
kind of remote um and you know you may

1067
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,480
have some obligations you have to uh

1068
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,680
check in with the email family etc

1069
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,560
um also though if you have any questions

1070
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,079
uh or or need to

1071
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,480
ask for any sort of clarity um you know

1072
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,200
we'll take a

1073
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,720
break here and i will stay uh right here

1074
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,560
and we'll reconvene at

1075
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,839
well we'll say 9 50 uh

1076
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,520
eastern time so more like a seven minute

1077
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,000
break

1078
00:38:48,000 --> 00:39:01,839
but thank you

1079
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,880
all right we received one question so

1080
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,839
far uh

1081
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,160
and the question is how can we classify

1082
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,880
and organize

1083
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,440
incidents with scores or severity levels

1084
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,359
on my company we are leveling

1085
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,480
the levels from zero to five or info to

1086
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,440
critical

1087
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,560
but is there another way to do it um and

1088
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:40,880
so

1089
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,240
uh right i and i see that's kind of

1090
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,319
based on um the way you're doing it is

1091
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,599
based on

1092
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,280
log output as well or security

1093
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,520
security alarms from monitoring tools

1094
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,280
one thing to consider is if you're

1095
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,000
looking at issues

1096
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,079
that concern your customers uh

1097
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,480
then you also have to look at uh how

1098
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,599
severe

1099
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,880
is the customer experience um especially

1100
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,520
if you

1101
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,640
respond to it so i'll give some examples

1102
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,920
that might help

1103
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,599
clarify if i see

1104
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,560
one report from an individual saying

1105
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,800
your customer sent me one piece of spam

1106
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,720
email

1107
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,200
i may just send a warning email to my

1108
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,160
customer

1109
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,440
and that would be categorized as a

1110
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,240
low priority incident whereas if i

1111
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:36,800
received

1112
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,880
a hundred different reports within an

1113
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,280
hour about spam emails from my customer

1114
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,560
then that's probably

1115
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,960
uh indicative that the customer has a

1116
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,480
much larger issue

1117
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,359
or the customer is a spammer themselves

1118
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:49,760
so

1119
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,079
i would prioritize that higher even

1120
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,640
though it's both spam incidents

1121
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,359
the issue is much more severe in this

1122
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,480
case

1123
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,440
similar if the customer is engaged in

1124
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,440
activity that is against the law in my

1125
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,560
country

1126
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,119
then that gets a higher priority level

1127
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:07,760
so

1128
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,400
we we typically prioritize things based

1129
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,400
off of type of attack

1130
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,000
with the last one being uncategorized

1131
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,040
so if there's a physical element to it

1132
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,040
like like i said it's some sort of legal

1133
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,960
law breaking some sort of

1134
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,880
online harassment that may lead to

1135
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,720
physical harassment

1136
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,119
those are understood to be high priority

1137
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,119
because there is a more imminent threat

1138
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,400
to it

1139
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,599
uh if the customer like i said

1140
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,160
is just sending out a newsletter to

1141
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,640
people who didn't want the newsletter

1142
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,800
that is not so much of a threat that's

1143
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,720
not contributing to malware

1144
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,400
distribution spread phishing emails that

1145
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,760
sort of thing

1146
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,920
that would be lower priority and you

1147
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,960
know would

1148
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,640
be back in the line potentially

1149
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,280
um so with severity levels how you label

1150
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,880
them you you could call them zero to

1151
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,440
five

1152
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,480
um or you know critical or or

1153
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,160
you know there's a number of labels you

1154
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,920
could apply to that

1155
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,839
but it really kind of comes down to how

1156
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,760
many reports you've seen

1157
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,200
and what is the threat of the activity

1158
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,079
that your customer was engaged with

1159
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,520
so i hope that answers your question

1160
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:37,839
but it's a good question

1161
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,560
okay we'll get started in just another

1162
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,839
minute

1163
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,960
okay uh we got one more question here uh

1164
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,720
what is the best practice to follow the

1165
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,000
takedown of a malicious domain

1166
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,119
uh so i assume it is you're a hosting

1167
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:15,760
provider

1168
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,319
and you've received an incident report

1169
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:18,880
about

1170
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,920
a domain being hosted within your

1171
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,119
service

1172
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,800
uh in that case um again you know

1173
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,240
what you can do with your customer all

1174
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,400
depends on uh you know

1175
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,599
local regulations uh so you know you

1176
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,880
have to take that into account but

1177
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,680
typically

1178
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,400
uh once you receive the report um

1179
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,319
hopefully it's categorized in a way that

1180
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,160
your analysts are able to quickly

1181
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,280
identify

1182
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,680
who the customer responsible is and you

1183
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,160
know where their account lies

1184
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,960
and you would typically i don't come

1185
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,040
from a hosting provider so i'm going

1186
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,400
based off of what i've seen from

1187
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,680
other companies uh but putting a

1188
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,880
placeholder page

1189
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,920
uh and a lot of hosting providers have

1190
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,319
the means to do this automatically

1191
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,000
putting a placeholder page so that

1192
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,800
people going to

1193
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,960
the domain understand that it is

1194
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,640
malicious

1195
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,800
potentially redirect putting a redirect

1196
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,480
in that sends

1197
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,240
a new request to some sort of security

1198
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,040
training or

1199
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,319
education about the attack and then

1200
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,079
following up with the customer hopefully

1201
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,359
you have records

1202
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:29,839
that you can identify who the customer

1203
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,960
is that the content was hosted on

1204
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,079
you have live contact information

1205
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,560
it's not a fake account you have some

1206
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,839
way of validating that

1207
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,359
hopefully but otherwise if you're unable

1208
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,599
to validate that it's a real person who

1209
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,760
set up the account

1210
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,319
you know maybe it's a cheap service of

1211
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,119
some sort

1212
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,599
where they can set them up fairly easily

1213
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,760
then i would imagine you would set up

1214
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,400
some sort of uh page where if they try

1215
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,040
to log back

1216
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,119
into their account for management they

1217
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,720
are made aware that you know you've

1218
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,440
disabled the account based off of that

1219
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,119
this is also where incident tracking

1220
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,839
comes into play

1221
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,000
because you know you would have a log of

1222
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,599
what i p address signed up for that

1223
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,359
account what i p address try to

1224
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,280
authenticate into that account and

1225
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,040
keeping track of that helps you to

1226
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,200
potentially prevent them from signing up

1227
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,960
other new accounts and setting up that

1228
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,440
domain again and again and again

1229
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,640
um so there's a number of uh a number of

1230
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,040
these

1231
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,160
tenants to kind of apply there um

1232
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,920
but hopefully that uh that answers the

1233
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,079
question um as far as takedown of a

1234
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,680
malicious domain that

1235
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,839
it's attacking your company or it's

1236
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,280
posing as your company

1237
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,760
but someone else is hosting it um

1238
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,040
there's

1239
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,040
this is where i recommend groups like

1240
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,559
first and like mog

1241
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,800
where you can start building up that

1242
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,440
trusted circle of collaborators to where

1243
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,480
um you know if you attend mog for

1244
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,400
example and i believe they're members of

1245
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,520
first as well

1246
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,400
companies like um amazon web services

1247
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,559
microsoft who has you know the azure

1248
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,000
hosting

1249
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,200
you can start building those

1250
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,680
relationships with their engineers and

1251
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,119
their analysts to where

1252
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:16,240
if there is a a attack on your company

1253
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,720
being hosted on their service you can

1254
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,920
reach out directly to

1255
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,839
them and work with them to get that

1256
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,520
taken down more quickly because they

1257
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,800
understand that

1258
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,559
um you know they can trust you as a

1259
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:27,920
source you're giving them all the

1260
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,599
information that they need

1261
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,440
and that you're using that relationship

1262
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,880
uh responsibly

1263
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,280
um so you know organizations like this

1264
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,359
are very critical to an abuse desk

1265
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,078
organization

1266
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,240
and another question good morning to you

1267
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,400
and uh the question is any tracking

1268
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,160
connection system you could talk about

1269
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,160
netflow uh tracking connection

1270
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,760
tracking connection system um so

1271
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,800
i don't work on the edge or

1272
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,160
the routing side of things but i know

1273
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,559
uh you know from what i've seen from our

1274
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,800
security organization and mog has a

1275
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,240
denial of service uh

1276
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,800
sig that that talks about um flow spec

1277
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,359
and

1278
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,880
you know reviewing some of those logs um

1279
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,960
you know if you're able to look at that

1280
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,720
traffic and

1281
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,319
make use of it to hopefully get in front

1282
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,280
of new attacks

1283
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,680
instead of waiting for other people to

1284
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,599
send it to you

1285
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,359
you know that that can be very valuable

1286
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,960
um i i work for

1287
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,079
a major isp here in the united states

1288
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,160
and i've worked for abuse desk and legal

1289
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,119
compliance for

1290
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,400
about 20 years and i work quite a bit

1291
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,559
with our security operations center

1292
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,839
who sends us you know um the the sorts

1293
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:50,720
of uh

1294
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,880
bad traffic that they see if there's a

1295
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,319
large denial of service that they've

1296
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:55,839
detected coming out

1297
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,440
they're not actively monitoring for

1298
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,200
things like spam or phishing of course

1299
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,079
because that would

1300
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,079
require a packet you know resolution and

1301
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,520
you know we don't want to look at that

1302
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,359
sort of traffic but if they see

1303
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:11,520
you know a traffic rate and destination

1304
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,960
ports and destination asns

1305
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,960
that look abnormal to them they will

1306
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,559
package up that information

1307
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,640
and we have an api that they can feed

1308
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,400
that info into

1309
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,240
and produce new incidents that will

1310
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,920
follow up with the customers um

1311
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,599
potentially put them in a wild garden

1312
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:28,480
state

1313
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,400
if they're you know participating in a

1314
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,520
denial of service

1315
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,000
attack uh which we we prioritize fairly

1316
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,119
high

1317
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,400
um so yeah uh you know things like uh

1318
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,160
network tracking systems you know

1319
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,760
internally can be very useful

1320
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,599
other companies sending you their data

1321
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,079
from their systems can be very useful

1322
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,440
um and it's it's a good systemic

1323
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,480
sort of incident log that you can build

1324
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,319
automation towards again which is a good

1325
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,520
segue into our next

1326
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,559
uh section here

1327
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,359
as far as which system in particular i i

1328
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:02,319
could

1329
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,960
recommend i unfortunately like i said i

1330
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,680
am

1331
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,599
i don't work directly on you know the

1332
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,359
routing in the the security operation

1333
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,319
side of things so

1334
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,160
so one more comment in our experience

1335
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,839
after reporting to registrars

1336
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,240
uh abuses the domain is still online

1337
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,920
even with domain status

1338
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,480
uh equaling with the domain status flag

1339
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,359
being client transfer prohibited

1340
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,559
um yeah that's i

1341
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,559
i think what you're starting to see now

1342
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,359
is um you know with the amount of

1343
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,400
um you know extremely bad

1344
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,400
you know content or harmful content

1345
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,520
misinformation

1346
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,960
political misinformation

1347
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,880
video content being hosted on some of

1348
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,559
these domains

1349
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,079
some of the registrars are starting to

1350
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,680
become

1351
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,720
you know some of the ones that weren't

1352
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,800
as responsible responsive in the past

1353
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,359
are becoming more responsive

1354
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,559
but what i am seeing them uh to at least

1355
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:07,440
is send

1356
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,520
their analysts and their engineers to

1357
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,119
you know some of these organizations

1358
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:11,599
like

1359
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,160
like mogan first again um to start

1360
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,119
participating

1361
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,880
and learn more about best practices

1362
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,640
because they understand that you know

1363
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,800
they may have a bad reputation in the

1364
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,119
community and in the industry and

1365
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,319
you know uh even since i i drafted some

1366
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,079
of this training a couple years ago

1367
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,319
i am seeing um you know this uh

1368
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:35,599
dedication to being good network

1369
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,359
services being responsive network

1370
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,520
services uh whether it's a social media

1371
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,640
platform

1372
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,839
or an isp or a hosting platform um

1373
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,000
you know executives and people making

1374
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,040
the decisions

1375
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,200
as to how to fund security within their

1376
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,559
organization

1377
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,680
um has been improving um so hopefully

1378
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,240
that

1379
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,559
that continues and you know uh we can

1380
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,800
have this open dialogue about

1381
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,400
what people are doing wrong or what they

1382
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,839
can improve on

1383
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,440
and they you know get a seat at the

1384
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,599
table and start improving on that

1385
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,400
all right so uh we'll go ahead and you

1386
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,079
know as i said before uh

1387
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:15,839
you know feel free to ask q a and you

1388
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,839
know i'll take a break here and there um

1389
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,599
to answer the questions

1390
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:22,960
um some things i uh may wait uh till the

1391
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:23,520
end

1392
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,640
um you know to to kind of follow up on

1393
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,559
but hopefully i can get to all of them

1394
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,640
uh within our time frame here

1395
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,880
uh but let's talk about uh the

1396
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,839
automation of it

1397
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,640
uh incident processing so you know he

1398
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,839
may get to a point

1399
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,880
where um you know you're getting so many

1400
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,000
incidents in to

1401
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,400
your abuse ad account or or whatever

1402
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,119
reporting

1403
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,720
uh website you you've set up um

1404
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,079
you know that that the people that you

1405
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,760
hired they don't have

1406
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,240
the ability to go through each every

1407
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,720
incident one by one by one

1408
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,599
so we'll talk about you know what a

1409
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:00,960
automation

1410
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,839
workflow looks like for an abuse desk

1411
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,720
so excuse me so starting with a report

1412
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,400
up in the upper left uh this is a high

1413
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,359
level overview

1414
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,839
of the email abuse incident intake

1415
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,040
process

1416
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,200
uh this highlights some key areas where

1417
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,839
technical solutions can be implemented

1418
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,800
so all stages should produce event

1419
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,599
logging

1420
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,559
preferably in a centralized location

1421
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,160
this will aid in efficient process

1422
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,680
improvement analysis or

1423
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,839
outage troubleshooting i don't know how

1424
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,680
many of you are developers

1425
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,280
but you know even with uh so much

1426
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,079
computer

1427
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,720
science history behind us um there's

1428
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,240
still an issue with people building

1429
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,359
systems that don't

1430
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:52,160
log as much as they should and don't

1431
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,119
create as much

1432
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,520
tracking as they should in order for you

1433
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,880
to go back and see

1434
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,040
where inefficiencies are or where you

1435
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,799
can make improvements or

1436
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:03,440
you know where the breakdowns occur so

1437
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:03,920
um

1438
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,079
you know i log collection and data

1439
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:07,599
tracking is always something that you

1440
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:08,960
know i stress

1441
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,040
from the onset and you should be put

1442
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,599
into place

1443
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,119
so let's uh let's go through the process

1444
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,160
uh for a report that comes in via email

1445
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,240
to a role account such as abuse ad or

1446
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,720
postmaster ad so

1447
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,640
according to the rfc if you have a

1448
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,079
domain you should

1449
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,559
accept email at abuse at that domain or

1450
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,599
postmaster at the

1451
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,160
domain and typically that's where a lot

1452
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,240
of automated reporting systems

1453
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,160
will send uh reports about your

1454
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,960
customers too

1455
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,480
so given that the role accounts will

1456
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,240
most often route to the same inbound

1457
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,440
mail server as

1458
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,720
the general mx record those

1459
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,680
mail transport server servers those smtp

1460
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,359
servers will need to be configured for

1461
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:58,400
exceptions to normal processing

1462
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,319
abuse test incidents will often contain

1463
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,720
material from phishing and spam attacks

1464
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,000
including the malicious urls so the mail

1465
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,520
system administrators will need to

1466
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,040
ensure that these are not blocked or

1467
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,880
filtered and that the reporting server

1468
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,880
isn't necessarily affected by sending

1469
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,040
these reports to the server

1470
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,799
on the other hand the ability to prevent

1471
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,319
mail bomb attacks against the royal

1472
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:18,799
account

1473
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,880
and prohibit known sources of spam from

1474
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,000
sending to the domain

1475
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,160
has to be considered as well so

1476
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,119
adjusting these

1477
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,280
mail policies will take several

1478
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,559
iterations

1479
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,319
as each organization's traffic is

1480
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:31,599
different

1481
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,480
so essentially you know if people are

1482
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,000
reporting

1483
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,319
examples of spam full examples of spam

1484
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,079
or phishing email that your customers

1485
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:40,400
are

1486
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,720
sending to them you want to make sure

1487
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,720
that your mail server is not

1488
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,559
treating those as phishing or spam that

1489
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,640
they're getting them into your system uh

1490
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,359
properly

1491
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,400
um and not filtering them out uh but by

1492
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,640
the same token you you do need it can't

1493
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,599
be wide open

1494
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,680
because you may have a mailbox bomb

1495
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,599
attack or denial of service attack

1496
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:04,000
directed at your role account there

1497
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,559
so a typical inbound message will be

1498
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,359
transported

1499
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:09,839
from the smtp server to a mail store

1500
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:13,040
system of some kind to await retrieval

1501
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,680
many modern smtp servers also provide

1502
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,200
functions to send messages over https

1503
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,760
to a remote api based on specific

1504
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,520
conditions

1505
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,280
so the message store is typically where

1506
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,359
your mail clients would pop

1507
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,799
or imap um retrieve the email

1508
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,119
but if the system has the ability to

1509
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,160
send stream the messages over https or

1510
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,119
you know send them through to an api of

1511
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:40,240
some sort

1512
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,920
uh that saves you the need to store the

1513
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,319
messages um so it saves you on some disk

1514
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:45,280
space

1515
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,920
um and it subsequently ingests them over

1516
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,119
more time

1517
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:51,839
so it saves you some disk space but also

1518
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,640
pop3 and imap as retrieval protocols

1519
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,280
can take a lot of time so if you're

1520
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,480
processing

1521
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,079
you know thousands and thousands of

1522
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,520
messages a day

1523
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,480
for incident reports and intel

1524
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,160
information

1525
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,319
pop3 or imap may not keep up with that

1526
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:09,359
flow uh

1527
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,280
into your uh through the rest of your

1528
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,400
tool set

1529
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,119
uh so you may want to have the mail

1530
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,040
administrator configure a report to go

1531
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,880
directly to the incident processing

1532
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,359
engine

1533
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,280
uh where it's destined for a specific

1534
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,839
role account

1535
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,200
so in the typical manual abuse desk

1536
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,319
operation

1537
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:31,200
the ingestion point is when stored

1538
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,040
inbound reports are retrieved and viewed

1539
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,640
with a mail client

1540
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,960
so some abuse desks um you know and this

1541
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,079
is how

1542
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:40,960
i started early on in my career um it

1543
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:41,520
was just

1544
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,000
outlook looking at the one email account

1545
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,920
and i was processing them all

1546
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,280
um you know manually but as automation's

1547
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,200
introduced applications can retrieve

1548
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,520
these emails over the same protocol

1549
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,200
and be further processed for data

1550
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,119
enrichment or the rest of the incident

1551
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:57,680
phase

1552
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,359
uh depending on the number of reports

1553
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,520
per day use of these protocols may be

1554
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,160
inefficient like i mentioned earlier

1555
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,839
or altogether infeasible given

1556
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,000
transactional overhead

1557
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,839
a more advanced solution as mentioned

1558
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:12,480
previously would be to provide the mta

1559
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,640
with an endpoint to inject the message

1560
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:19,839
into subsequent processing in real time

1561
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,280
so from there categorization logic is

1562
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,079
applied

1563
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:25,760
this would be the priority model that we

1564
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,359
discussed earlier

1565
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,119
it typically consists of predefined

1566
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,480
pattern matching and conditional

1567
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,559
evaluations like the example i listed

1568
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:33,920
there

1569
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,000
categorization will evolve over time as

1570
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,079
new sources of incidents appear

1571
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,480
new services are launched or attack

1572
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,760
vectors evolve

1573
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,160
the solution processing the logic should

1574
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,720
allow for new conditions to be added

1575
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,359
so if all of a sudden your low priority

1576
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:50,240
spam

1577
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,559
numbers start spiking you start seeing a

1578
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:53,760
lot of incidents

1579
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,720
being categorized that way versus some

1580
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,160
of your other categories

1581
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,160
that's where you want to review your

1582
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,319
incident tracking and your processing

1583
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:03,760
logs to see

1584
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,920
if there's someone new sending you these

1585
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,799
reports and are they actually spam or

1586
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:10,960
are they firewall reports that you're

1587
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,839
not categorizing correctly

1588
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,799
from there identifying the subscriber

1589
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,160
device responsible

1590
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,160
for an incident will depend heavily on

1591
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,079
the service provider and is where much

1592
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:24,400
of

1593
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,160
customization takes place for large

1594
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,000
scale solutions

1595
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,079
for an isp this will typically involve

1596
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,040
queries against

1597
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,480
their own ldap and dhcp services

1598
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,240
to associate a customer with an email

1599
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,079
address and ip lease

1600
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:39,839
for other service platforms the lookup

1601
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,000
may be relative to the domain being sent

1602
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
from or the assigned ip that their

1603
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,319
traffic is transmitted from

1604
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:47,920
typically an organization will have a

1605
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,880
secured api or data store available

1606
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,720
for this information as it's utilized

1607
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,960
for support tools and accounting as well

1608
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,240
for your billing services and whatnot

1609
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,000
given the critical nature of subscriber

1610
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,680
data placement of the abuse desk

1611
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,960
automation platform

1612
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,040
on your network may have to take into

1613
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,319
consideration

1614
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:08,400
uh your security policies surrounding

1615
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,559
access to this data

1616
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,160
so this is where having you know if you

1617
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,240
build a complete automation solution or

1618
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,520
you buy a complete automation solution

1619
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,559
you may be required to put it you know

1620
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,200
deep within the firewall infrastructure

1621
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,720
of your organization because you're

1622
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,319
going to be transporting

1623
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:31,520
subscriber pii account numbers phone

1624
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,520
numbers contact information

1625
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,520
um so you have to take that into account

1626
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,119
um you're going from a public

1627
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,720
report intake to you know internal

1628
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,440
subscriber

1629
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,839
identification so at some point you'll

1630
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:44,720
be

1631
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,319
hopping from the public to the private

1632
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,720
network

1633
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,880
so remediation logic will also depend on

1634
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,039
corporate customer engagement regulatory

1635
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,280
policies uh like we mentioned earlier uh

1636
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,720
the solution should recognize

1637
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,440
per category in other defined conditions

1638
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,720
where to route the incident for

1639
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,079
resolution

1640
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:06,720
as we discussed earlier uh associating

1641
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,079
the offending party with an email

1642
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:09,680
address in order to send a warning

1643
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,760
notification may suffice

1644
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,319
in other situations a highly prioritized

1645
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:15,680
manual investigation

1646
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,599
and interaction via phone call may be

1647
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,280
necessary

1648
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,440
when manual remediation is required the

1649
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,119
abuse desk team members should have

1650
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,280
consistent and easy to find reference

1651
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,079
materials

1652
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,319
that they are able to contribute to as

1653
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:31,039
new problem cases or tools arise

1654
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,640
maintaining a knowledge database is

1655
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,640
essential to providing the customer with

1656
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,839
a positive experience

1657
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,599
while correcting the current incident

1658
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,440
and hopefully preventing reoccurrence

1659
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,599
so automating other sources um you know

1660
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,520
the the automation phase concept in

1661
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,680
processing email reports

1662
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,839
uh can remain fairly consistent for

1663
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,119
other types of reports

1664
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,839
uh that you may be open to receive uh

1665
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,839
things like web forms are often used in

1666
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:03,599
order to facilitate the gathering

1667
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,240
of all the required information for an

1668
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,920
incident

1669
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,160
while useful in minimizing reports that

1670
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,920
cannot be processed because you're

1671
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,760
asking for the specific data that you

1672
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,559
need

1673
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:16,319
it does make it difficult for an

1674
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:17,599
automated reporting

1675
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,760
uh system from a third party to interact

1676
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,319
with um so i would not recommend that as

1677
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:22,720
your

1678
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,880
one and only intake source for an abuse

1679
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,039
desk

1680
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,280
but it is helpful for specific types of

1681
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,839
incidents

1682
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,079
another potential intake option for

1683
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,079
platforms or providers that support

1684
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,520
services beyond email

1685
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,640
is exarf which is

1686
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,520
there's a ietf rfc listed here that you

1687
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,520
can read up on

1688
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,200
the concept provides a means of

1689
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,119
efficiently processing reports for a

1690
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:50,319
variety of network

1691
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:53,280
act attacks and policy violations which

1692
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,160
historically had

1693
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,920
undefined report structures that made

1694
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,599
automation difficult

1695
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,079
so report generation parsing and

1696
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:01,359
validation all

1697
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:03,200
all have open source libraries to build

1698
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,799
solutions with

1699
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:08,160
uh so if you go to xarf.org you can find

1700
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,400
you know a lot of the information as

1701
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,160
well as reference links for

1702
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,640
the various open source libraries to

1703
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,359
implement this

1704
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,079
so the scope of your automation can

1705
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,839
include benefits to other groups within

1706
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:25,599
your company so we talked about the net

1707
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,799
flow incidence

1708
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:29,760
coming into your abuse desk as well or

1709
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,240
other

1710
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,280
connection tracking so the same system

1711
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,440
and logic that you took in

1712
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,960
xr for email or web incidents

1713
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,520
could potentially provide the abuse desk

1714
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,039
with a solution to handle data from

1715
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:44,079
internal sources

1716
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,119
based off of analytics if the abuse desk

1717
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:48,880
or other security department within the

1718
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,000
organization has

1719
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,079
frequent analytic cycles in order to

1720
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,160
detect likely account compromise or

1721
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,880
violations of the acceptable use policy

1722
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,400
these two could be fed into the

1723
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,039
collection

1724
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:02,319
and remediation system so things like

1725
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:04,400
the connection tracking system

1726
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,200
your the team that administers your

1727
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,240
authentication

1728
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,520
system um maybe set up some policies

1729
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,799
with them to say

1730
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:15,839
you know if we see several um

1731
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,720
uh account logins from all over the

1732
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,720
world to one single account that account

1733
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,799
may be compromised

1734
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:24,640
have them send you the time stamp the

1735
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,920
user information and the ips involved

1736
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,920
you know or whatever your system

1737
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,720
requires to identify a customer

1738
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,039
you know most systems that are public

1739
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,359
facing services within your company

1740
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:39,920
can be sources of analytics and logs

1741
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,599
that your abuse desk can

1742
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:45,119
act on when it involves the customer

1743
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,680
this is especially true nowadays because

1744
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,280
you know one of the biggest

1745
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,799
issues facing abuse desks and um

1746
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:55,039
incident response teams is account

1747
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:55,839
compromise

1748
01:05:55,839 --> 01:06:00,000
um the you know the rise in

1749
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,599
you know trying to gather credentials

1750
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,839
from customers and you know using those

1751
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:04,880
shared credentials

1752
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,000
to access you know things as

1753
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,240
innocent as netflix or you know amazon

1754
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,280
video uh to getting into bank accounts

1755
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,799
to opening credit cards and and

1756
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:18,799
performing identity theft

1757
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:20,400
so getting a handle on account

1758
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,400
compromise by working with your

1759
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,599
authentication team

1760
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,400
to you know intake you know what looks

1761
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,559
like abnormal behavior

1762
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:30,880
and setting up conditions about that can

1763
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,799
be a big win for the abuse desk

1764
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,720
um you know as far as being the team

1765
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,640
that you know produces those

1766
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,799
uh those securities for an organization

1767
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,240
all right so let's uh let's talk about

1768
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,000
the actual staff the actual people doing

1769
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,720
the work now

1770
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:57,200
so um a successful abuse desk analyst

1771
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,079
uh or technician uh depends on what your

1772
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:00,559
company

1773
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:04,079
you know calls him engineer requires a

1774
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:05,680
diversified set of skills

1775
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,799
uh one must be technical but also able

1776
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:10,400
to effectively communicate with

1777
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,000
customers and outside uh

1778
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,119
vendors you know they may be dealing

1779
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:16,480
with a number of

1780
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,359
different types of parties and so you

1781
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:21,440
want to also make sure that

1782
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,760
empathy and verbal communication skills

1783
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,400
is present

1784
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,039
so when you estimate the size of the

1785
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,520
team or you're looking to expand an

1786
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,480
existing team

1787
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,480
uh long-term trends have to be taken

1788
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,839
into account

1789
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:38,079
um so this is again when you're looking

1790
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:39,119
at incidents

1791
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:41,359
over time you know if you start trending

1792
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:43,280
and you see there's a

1793
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,559
um you know a potential bump in growth

1794
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,160
maybe you're taking on a new account

1795
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,440
compromise program

1796
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,839
to support or maybe you're just seeing

1797
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,839
incidents build as your company

1798
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:57,119
brings on new customers you know being

1799
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:58,000
able to

1800
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
quantify that you know helps you plan

1801
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,400
out how big your team needs to be

1802
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,160
so while it's not feasible to be

1803
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,839
consistently overstaffed

1804
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:08,880
uh compared to the average incident rate

1805
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,640
your department should be able to stop

1806
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,839
large influxes as quickly as possible

1807
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,520
growing problems that are not dealt with

1808
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,359
quickly become a backlog that is much

1809
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,439
more expensive to recover from

1810
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:22,158
if a large attack happens and you're

1811
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:25,839
short staffed

1812
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,399
there's some core duties throughout most

1813
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,000
abuse tests that require technical

1814
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:30,799
skills

1815
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:32,799
your operation may vary and how many of

1816
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:34,479
them are necessary

1817
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:36,238
and what can be trained on the job due

1818
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:37,759
to the proprietary nature of your

1819
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,238
service platforms

1820
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:42,719
so you may have internal tools internal

1821
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:43,759
billing accounts

1822
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:46,399
databases you know all of that has to be

1823
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:47,120
taken into

1824
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,920
account whether or not you know you

1825
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,359
require someone to have

1826
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,279
you know network service testing skills

1827
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,560
let's say or someone to be

1828
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,158
familiar with apache log

1829
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:02,000
you know a parsing and that sort of

1830
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,158
thing

1831
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,880
so once a team is built it's important

1832
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,640
to ensure measures are taken to keep

1833
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,719
those employees engaged and as

1834
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:12,799
stress-free as possible

1835
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,799
abuse desk fatigue has become fairly

1836
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:16,719
well documented in a number of recent

1837
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,560
articles

1838
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,479
you know whether they're called a

1839
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:22,319
compliance desk abuse desk

1840
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,560
um social media platforms call them

1841
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,040
moderation desks a lot of times

1842
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:30,080
um there's quite a few news reports uh

1843
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,359
showing how the job takes mental stress

1844
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:35,198
on employees

1845
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:37,679
so keeping the employees up to date with

1846
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,679
information and pending changes

1847
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:41,040
maintaining clear and honest

1848
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,600
communication with the employee

1849
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,359
giving importance to their ideas and

1850
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:47,439
opinions as well as providing them

1851
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:50,238
honest feedback and generous praise

1852
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:51,839
seem to have the most support when we

1853
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:55,120
talk to managers and

1854
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,560
executives of productive and successful

1855
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,640
abuse desk teams

1856
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,280
abuse work is generally a thankless task

1857
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:03,679
um

1858
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,440
you know customers don't typically call

1859
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,120
in and say you know thank you for

1860
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,440
warning me about a security incident

1861
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,040
um so you know your employees feeling

1862
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,040
that upper management's being supportive

1863
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,880
and recognizes the importance of their

1864
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,280
work

1865
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,960
is a great boost to the employees so

1866
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,400
make sure that they're getting positive

1867
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,440
feedback

1868
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,520
um you know from from some direction

1869
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,760
there

1870
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:29,920
so while it may incur some costs

1871
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,760
initially ensuring that your team is

1872
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,440
able to perform their functions and make

1873
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,120
decisions based on experience and

1874
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,960
internal reference materials

1875
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,800
will ensure long-term protections for

1876
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,760
the company's reputation or brand

1877
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,040
as well as maintaining employee

1878
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,800
satisfaction with the function that

1879
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,800
they're performing

1880
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,640
involving employees in abuse related

1881
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,640
decision making asking them for their

1882
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,679
ideas opinions and possible solutions

1883
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:55,040
and then making it clear that those

1884
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,840
thoughts were taken into serious

1885
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,040
consideration

1886
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,360
it's it's empowering technicians to make

1887
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,280
decisions uh regarding the work they're

1888
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,080
doing

1889
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,679
and having management back them up when

1890
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,239
those decisions are

1891
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:11,040
made with you know even irate customers

1892
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:11,520
uh

1893
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,000
receiving equal share of the votes so

1894
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:14,560
you know

1895
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,560
involve them in the decision making um

1896
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,679
you know

1897
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:20,640
as more incidents are worked overtime by

1898
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,840
the technicians

1899
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,960
or the analysts they will have a better

1900
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,440
sense for what policies are effective

1901
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,280
and what are not effective if they're

1902
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,120
seeing the same customer

1903
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,840
uh every day or every week having the

1904
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:34,239
same

1905
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,719
issue then you know there may be

1906
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:38,239
something that needs to change on the

1907
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,280
service or there may

1908
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:43,040
be something about your policies and the

1909
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,600
priority model that needs to change so

1910
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,440
you know involving them in the the

1911
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,719
review

1912
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:51,520
of the work and the decision making um

1913
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,000
you know

1914
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,840
is critical but it also helps with their

1915
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,320
morale

1916
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,239
so as described in a white paper

1917
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:02,640
regarding the processing of sensitive

1918
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,080
sensitive incident reports a mog member

1919
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:06,880
and i believe a

1920
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,480
first member alexander hugo

1921
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,199
explains that quote exposure to such

1922
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:13,760
content

1923
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,480
requires a suitable working space setup

1924
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,320
appropriate working conditions and

1925
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,239
psychological assessments to protect

1926
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,000
professionals and help them safeguard

1927
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,960
their personal well-being so the first

1928
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,400
consideration is the workplace

1929
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,080
environment

1930
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,760
you know they may be working on

1931
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,840
sensitive information

1932
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,600
if they're looking at things like spam

1933
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,120
emails it may be

1934
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,360
offensive to other employees who may

1935
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,960
walk by

1936
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,400
there's also a lot of customer

1937
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,719
information and security information

1938
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:45,840
that you want to make sure is secured

1939
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,000
but by the same token you don't want

1940
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,880
every

1941
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,040
staff member kind of working in a bubble

1942
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,560
and feeling like they're working on this

1943
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,000
stuff alone so

1944
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,040
things like screen protection um

1945
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,280
[Music]

1946
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,440
you know and you know maybe higher

1947
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,040
cubicle walls or

1948
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,320
you know now that they're working from

1949
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:05,760
home you know some sort of a desk

1950
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,520
you know walls things that you know can

1951
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,960
protect the line of sight

1952
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,400
may be necessary

1953
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,600
it's going to be different for every

1954
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,360
office space of course

1955
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,360
uh con continuing with his

1956
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,120
recommendations uh we consider the

1957
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,800
working conditions of the assigned staff

1958
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,159
members who work these uh

1959
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:28,960
incidents um you know a lot of times you

1960
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,400
want to make sure that they can decide

1961
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,480
when breaks are necessary

1962
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,640
they may have had a shocking incident or

1963
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,679
just a really bad customer experience

1964
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,280
so you know they may want to take a

1965
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,880
break sooner than um

1966
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,159
you know what you would have assigned

1967
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:44,080
them so that they can

1968
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,520
decompress and recover from that um

1969
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,080
a lot of offices use relaxation areas

1970
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,280
away from

1971
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,840
where um they work their incidents um

1972
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,520
and may include things like a tv

1973
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,760
or you know ping pong or some sort of

1974
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:58,719
game

1975
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:01,360
uh setup but you want to have that

1976
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:04,560
separated from the work area typically

1977
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,800
you also want to have management or hr

1978
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,880
human resources staff readily available

1979
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,120
for the conversations when needed

1980
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,400
if they you know i

1981
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,360
have a some sort of a anxiety attack

1982
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,040
because of an incident and i have seen

1983
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,239
this happen

1984
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:22,719
um because of something they saw some

1985
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:24,640
interaction with the customer

1986
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,600
the the criticality of the work that was

1987
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,640
coming through

1988
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,480
or it could even be the work that

1989
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,159
they're doing combined with something

1990
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,320
going on in their personal life

1991
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,840
you want to have someone you know that

1992
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,840
can talk to them quickly about that and

1993
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,960
either address it

1994
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,159
let them go home if need be um

1995
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:44,400
or you know or otherwise just give them

1996
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,199
an ear to

1997
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,520
you know speak to um you don't want them

1998
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,800
waiting till the end of the day or the

1999
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,600
next morning to have to deal with that

2000
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,600
um and then regular team meetings to

2001
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,360
discuss working conditions so

2002
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,719
you know assuming you've implemented

2003
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:59,840
some of this how are they using it is it

2004
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,000
comfortable for them are they finding it

2005
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,199
useful

2006
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:05,280
um you know is there anything else you

2007
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,360
know that that they would rather have in

2008
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:11,839
some of these situations

2009
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,960
so you know with a lot of the uh content

2010
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,080
that they'll have to be

2011
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,480
examining and the the type of work that

2012
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,400
they'll be doing uh you want to consider

2013
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,320
psychological help

2014
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,560
mr hugo describes the need for this

2015
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,000
consideration

2016
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,960
before during and after even the job is

2017
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,480
assigned

2018
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,800
he advises not to generalize a type of

2019
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,400
person who will be able to endure this

2020
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,840
job but rather allowing for a

2021
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,520
professional to consider their ability

2022
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,679
and ongoing help

2023
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:44,400
so while it seems like you know this

2024
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,120
would be

2025
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:49,040
high cost you know

2026
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,199
offering some sort of psychological

2027
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:52,159
evaluation

2028
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:54,159
or you know some some form of this

2029
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:55,760
depending on what's available in your

2030
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,520
region

2031
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,760
can cost you less in the long run than

2032
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,960
having to consistently

2033
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:06,239
replace employees and train new ones

2034
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:07,840
into the job

2035
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,960
in some cases it may be you know it

2036
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,560
could turn bad for your company

2037
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,120
if you have a lot of employees suffering

2038
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,040
mental health issues as a result of the

2039
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,560
job

2040
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,960
you know we've seen where they go to the

2041
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,880
press and the media and talk about how

2042
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,719
they feel unsupported and how they

2043
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:27,199
they turn to things like drug abuse or

2044
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:29,199
or you know depression

2045
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:31,840
um as a result of the job and you know

2046
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,760
your company does not

2047
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,199
you know your company can avoid that

2048
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,960
that's not something that's a positive

2049
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,960
effect on the brand and so

2050
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,360
um you know for their health you know

2051
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,159
consider

2052
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:44,159
again before during and after the the

2053
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:48,480
job assignment

2054
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,800
so uh let's take a look at results and

2055
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,239
reporting for the abuse test training

2056
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:53,679
you have your people in place

2057
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:56,719
you have your your tools in place um

2058
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:58,880
how do you share your success right how

2059
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,480
do you show that you know you've taken

2060
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,480
all this into consideration

2061
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,199
and you've built up a team um you know

2062
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:05,920
that that

2063
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,280
you know is efficient and uh

2064
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,920
high morale uh so due to the level of

2065
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,679
effort required in maintaining

2066
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:16,080
a successful abuse test you know we

2067
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,679
often fail to document and share our

2068
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:20,320
success with the rest of our company

2069
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,199
you may feel if you're the manager or

2070
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:24,880
you know you run the abuse desk

2071
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,239
that you know no news is good news

2072
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:30,640
as some of us like to say that you know

2073
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,840
if

2074
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,560
you're not uh being listed on spam house

2075
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,040
or

2076
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,960
you know there's not a lot of customer

2077
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,280
complaints uh coming into the customer

2078
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,560
service center

2079
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,520
um that is you're doing your job and you

2080
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,920
know you'll continue doing your job

2081
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,560
because no one's reporting that you're

2082
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,080
doing a bad job

2083
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,520
but you know what we forget a lot of

2084
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,800
times is reporting out and making sure

2085
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,239
the rest of the company and even the

2086
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:58,400
industry know that you're doing a good

2087
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,800
job and how

2088
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,199
you know much work you have to do to

2089
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:04,080
maintain

2090
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:07,280
that lack of complaint

2091
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,159
so uh one example um you know if you

2092
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:14,000
want to tie dollars to it

2093
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,120
is cost analysis you know there's

2094
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,840
a number of things that you know you may

2095
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,360
touch as a result of

2096
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,440
processing incident so this chart

2097
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,679
details the data points

2098
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:27,920
for defining a cost of spam to

2099
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,239
stakeholders within your company

2100
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:33,520
the chart details what's required to

2101
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,520
determine both the number and the cost

2102
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,040
of staff required to handle the number

2103
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,040
of incoming incidents so

2104
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,040
you know things of how much does one

2105
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,560
piece of spam

2106
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,719
cost your company you can tie some

2107
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:45,679
numbers around

2108
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,840
and then you know for the amount of

2109
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,640
spammy block or the amount of

2110
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,000
spam you filter you can reflect that as

2111
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
a potential cost savings for your

2112
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,560
company um and this is an example

2113
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,480
same with you know malicious domains um

2114
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,400
you know if you you calculate the cost

2115
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,080
of your staff and how many

2116
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,159
incidents how many less incidents you

2117
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:09,920
took in because you're effectively

2118
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,640
taking action on those malicious domains

2119
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,400
again that's cost savings that you know

2120
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,679
potentially

2121
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:17,920
you get to use to enhance your

2122
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,480
department or at least is a success

2123
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:24,320
you know in your executive size

2124
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,560
so uh to summarize a successful abuse

2125
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,239
desk cannot rely solely on the

2126
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,080
expectations of the industry in many

2127
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,520
cases

2128
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,440
so the benefits should be quantifiable

2129
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,280
per type of activity

2130
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,520
as i mentioned earlier it helps justify

2131
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,960
ongoing performance

2132
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,280
but it also potentially enables you to

2133
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,640
involve into

2134
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,679
other similar roles right so you know

2135
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:53,760
if you barely have enough staff and

2136
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:54,960
resources to

2137
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,760
respond to phishing incidents you're not

2138
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,960
going to want to take on

2139
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,600
things like compromised account response

2140
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,600
necessarily and help build a new

2141
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,000
more efficient system for that but if

2142
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,440
you show how much your

2143
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,400
phishing incident response has saved in

2144
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,080
customer service cost or

2145
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:15,120
email storage costs then that could be

2146
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,960
the justification to bring on

2147
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,600
more people and and start a account

2148
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,239
compromise

2149
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:22,960
project things like that and so you know

2150
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,400
many of us come from a technical

2151
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,760
background from an engineering

2152
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,199
background so we we don't

2153
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:30,000
typically think along the lines of

2154
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,239
business and financial justification

2155
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:35,920
but you know there are things that you

2156
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,920
know have costs associated with them

2157
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,440
that your finance team or your

2158
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,360
accountants may not be looking at but

2159
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:41,840
you know

2160
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,159
you're aware of it and you you know

2161
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:45,280
taking some time to

2162
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,840
tie those dollar amounts together that

2163
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:48,320
you know

2164
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,840
the costs together you know could

2165
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,199
definitely help your department in the

2166
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:52,320
long run

2167
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:55,760
um my abuse desk team at the isp that i

2168
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:56,639
work at

2169
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:58,719
like i said earlier 20 years ago it was

2170
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,480
me working out of

2171
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,120
outlook responding to spam and firewall

2172
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,800
complaints and the occasional

2173
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,320
you know harassment complaint um on aol

2174
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,239
chat or whatever you know was being used

2175
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:12,159
at that time

2176
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,159
you know we've built that up over time

2177
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:15,760
and you know because of things like

2178
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,679
copyright infringement having to be done

2179
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:19,920
and and some of the successes we had in

2180
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,199
automating uh the email report intake

2181
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:24,719
and you know making

2182
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:27,120
efficient use of uh the resources we had

2183
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,480
together

2184
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,600
available we trained technicians to

2185
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,280
become developers and help us

2186
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,320
do that automation as well over time so

2187
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,239
you had people who knew

2188
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:40,800
both the technical and the customer

2189
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,080
pieces of it

2190
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:45,199
uh at this point we have over uh 75

2191
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:46,239
technicians uh

2192
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:48,239
reviewing thousands and thousands of

2193
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,320
incidents and building data models for

2194
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,480
account compromise

2195
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,120
you know creating reputation scores and

2196
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,159
trying to prevent

2197
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:59,840
um attacks and be responsive to denial

2198
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,679
of service attacks so

2199
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:05,120
um you know again the abuse and security

2200
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,320
