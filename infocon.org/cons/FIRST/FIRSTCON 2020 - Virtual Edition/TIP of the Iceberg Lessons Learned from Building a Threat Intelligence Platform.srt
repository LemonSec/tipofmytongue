00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,599
hi everybody thanks for joining us this

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,079
is tracy from the first events team

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,320
just a few very quick reminders before

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,840
we get started

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,640
all attendees are muted if you are using

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,400
the event app we encourage you to check

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,960
in to the session update your activities

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,800
and be sure to complete the session

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,240
survey at the end

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,558
if you are having any app trouble and an

11
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,640
android user please send us an email

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,200
at events at first.org and we'll try to

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,280
see if we can help you out

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,280
just a reminder the session is tlp white

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,640
and is being recorded

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,800
recordings will be available within 24

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,360
hours via the app and the desktop site

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,039
and with that i'd like to introduce you

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,039
to your session moderator

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,719
for this session dr serge rose search

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,280
okay thank you tracy and welcome

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,719
everybody

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,559
tracy's edit my name is serge ross and

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:01,840
i'll moderate

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,720
this session and a couple of just tiny

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,159
things before we start

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,880
uh please add your questions and we hope

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,760
there's lots of questions of

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,880
to the q and a section of the of zoom

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,880
and then i'll then process them as they

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,439
come in at the end in the q a period

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,040
and uh having said that let's

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,240
go ahead with martin ayan the

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,680
chief or head of research of mnemonics

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,280
talking about lessons learned from

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,960
building a threat intelligence platform

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,520
i'm eager to hear this i'm building one

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,960
myself right now so

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,079
without further ado martin

40
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,520
thank you um for the past

41
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,280
three years we've been basically

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,920
building a threat intelligence platform

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,680
uh called act act and it's tailored for

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,200
analysis and automation

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,399
and during that work we made

46
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,880
observations on state-of-the-art and

47
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,560
threat intelligence platforms

48
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,240
uh on threat sharing and

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,920
some general observations on the field

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,239
of threat intelligence

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,120
uh we made mistakes uh we found some

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,879
issues both obvious and

53
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,400
maybe some more subtle and we tried to

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,680
find solutions

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,640
that work in the real world so this

56
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,400
presentation is about

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,040
all the lessons we learned on the way

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,520
and

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,000
hopefully some of those lessons can be

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,200
useful

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,680
to the rest of the community so just a

62
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,360
quick agenda

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,040
i'll very briefly introduce threat

64
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,560
intelligence

65
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,040
i'll talk a little bit about why we

66
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,800
built a threat intelligence platform

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,720
and what we did and then the main part

68
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,599
will be the lessons learned

69
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,519
and i'll round off with a call to arms

70
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,360
and a little bit about the rogue ad

71
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,760
what we're going to do in the future but

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,640
first off

73
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,760
what is threat intelligence and why did

74
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,920
we build this app platform

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,879
threat intelligence is something to help

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,879
you correctly assess risk

77
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,080
and to help you defend against real and

78
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,519
relevant threats rather than

79
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,640
imaginary ones there are

80
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,720
multiple different definitions of threat

81
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
intelligence

82
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
they either say that it's the knowledge

83
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,760
of threats

84
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,800
or information about threats the key

85
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,440
difference there is that knowledge

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,239
implies understanding and the core

87
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,159
component of understanding

88
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,640
is being able to identify causes and

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,000
effects

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,480
and as security professionals we

91
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,560
primarily observe effects

92
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,959
we see traces of activity in large files

93
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,159
in network traffic

94
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,560
on endpoints and then we try to reason

95
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,480
about that to figure out what

96
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,599
caused these traces what are the likely

97
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,440
causes

98
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,920
so we went for a definition of threat

99
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,959
intelligence as

100
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,840
knowledge and we built the act platform

101
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,480
to store

102
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
our knowledge of threats to try to make

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,119
it more useful

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,400
being able to efficiently find prior

105
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,920
knowledge about the threat

106
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,400
and relate that to what you're observing

107
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
here now is useful

108
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,319
it can help you to get more context and

109
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,199
it can help you make the right decisions

110
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,238
uh making it useful also means to

111
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,000
automate where possible so you don't

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,360
waste time

113
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,800
doing repetitive manual work

114
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,320
on this path or request

115
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,360
to automate we found a wide range of

116
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,479
issues with threat intelligence

117
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,520
standards with

118
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,479
terminology and with information sources

119
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,320
and threat intelligence is like it's

120
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,040
kind of like

121
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,560
trying to lay a puzzle with missing

122
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,720
pieces on certain pieces

123
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,080
wrong pieces and even changing pieces

124
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,240
so a threat intelligence platform that

125
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,720
takes all that into account

126
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,080
can help you understand and explain

127
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,680
what you're observing here and now

128
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,520
actually means

129
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,240
as well as how certain you can be about

130
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,039
your conclusions

131
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,280
so the first thing we did was to

132
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,880
investigate all of the available threat

133
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,000
intelligence platform

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,240
and try to figure out if they could meet

135
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,080
our requirements

136
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,600
we came to the conclusion that they

137
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,440
couldn't

138
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,840
because at a very high level our goal

139
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,600
was we needed a platform that would

140
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,479
help us to collect and organize our

141
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,120
knowledge

142
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,560
of threats to facilitate analysis and

143
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,160
sharing and to make it easy to retrieve

144
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,000
that knowledge when we needed it

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,919
we spent way too much time on manual

146
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,000
processing copy-pasting information

147
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,759
between systems

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,440
and a lot of our knowledge wasn't

149
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,800
unstructured form

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,039
like human-readable threat reports and

151
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,160
that made it difficult

152
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,240
and time-consuming to figure out if we

153
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,520
had relevant knowledge

154
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,280
that could help us decide how to handle

155
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,160
a security incident or alert

156
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,039
and to break it down a bit goal number

157
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,759
one was to build a knowledge base

158
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,240
we wanted a one-stop shop for our

159
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,000
knowledge of threats

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,759
but we didn't want to store all of the

161
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,919
information there we store pointers to

162
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,919
other systems with more details but

163
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,240
this platform should give us the

164
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,360
overview

165
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,800
how things are connected

166
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,479
we wanted to be able to store knowledge

167
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,000
not just information

168
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,639
and that means that semantics matter we

169
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,360
need to have meaningful relations

170
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,880
we wanted to be able to retrieve that

171
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,240
knowledge to find and understand it

172
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,759
and relate it to what we're observing

173
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,680
here or not

174
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,080
and finally we wanted to be able to

175
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,960
quantify

176
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,919
uncertainty that means managing trust

177
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,479
confidence and also missing information

178
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,120
how certain can it be that this claim is

179
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,840
actually true

180
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,880
second goal was semi-automation

181
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,680
we wanted as far as possible to automate

182
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,720
the collection

183
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,039
of threat intelligence and that also

184
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,680
means to be able to extract structured

185
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,639
data information from human readable

186
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,000
unstructured text

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,080
because a lot of the relevant

188
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,759
information is only available as

189
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,639
unstructured information

190
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,880
we wanted to automate the rich notes and

191
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,319
that's basically the process of

192
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,840
converting data to information

193
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,960
we wanted to automate analysis to be

194
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,720
able to gain new knowledge from what we

195
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,479
already knew

196
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,440
counter measures to mitigate the threats

197
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,560
that we discovered

198
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,759
and finally lossless information

199
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,280
we want to be able to share information

200
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,039
without losing it on the way

201
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,880
and that's a big problem with most

202
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,800
threat sharing today

203
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,840
and finally we needed strict access

204
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,879
control

205
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,479
we wanted role-based access control

206
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,360
to get access management scalable

207
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,520
but we also needed explicit access

208
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,599
control because in threat intelligence a

209
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,280
fairly common use case is i want to

210
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,879
share this piece of information with

211
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,280
that

212
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,559
individual by no one else

213
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,360
we need support for multi-tenancy that

214
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,440
means multiple different information

215
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,800
owners in the same platform instance

216
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,360
and finally granular access controls we

217
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,039
need to be able to

218
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,440
control access to every single piece of

219
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,160
information

220
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,599
in the platform so that was a short

221
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,800
intro lesson number one

222
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,160
is it's all about relations because

223
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,000
the key difference between data and

224
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,679
information is that

225
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,479
information tells you how data points

226
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:36,799
are

227
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,479
related to each other and as an example

228
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,120
an ip address is a data point and by

229
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,679
itself

230
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,279
it's pretty worthless from a threat

231
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,040
intelligence viewpoint

232
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,240
the interesting information is

233
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,600
how is this ip address related to other

234
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,480
data points

235
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,360
like have we seen files downloaded from

236
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,080
it

237
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,040
were those files malicious do they

238
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,440
belong to a specific malware family

239
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,640
which organization owns this ip address

240
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,839
which domain names are resolved to it

241
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,880
so a graph is a convenient and useful

242
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,000
model for

243
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,040
describing relations and therefore we

244
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,839
implemented the act platform as a graph

245
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,000
database

246
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
that means that it also supports graph

247
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,600
queries automated

248
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,920
analysis by traversing graph

249
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,279
so all of these data points or

250
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,800
observables are

251
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,880
nodes in the graph whereas the useful

252
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,240
information

253
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,600
are represented as edges relating to

254
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,440
objects or object properties

255
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,360
objects are unique so all the

256
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
information we've collected on

257
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,440
for example an ip address are connected

258
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,480
to the same

259
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,320
object so if you retrieve that object

260
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,080
and all the relations you get all the

261
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,480
information we have on it

262
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,680
and just a point note that a

263
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,560
graph view is not the same as a graph

264
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,200
database

265
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,800
because you can display any kind of data

266
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,720
even a flat text file

267
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,040
as a graph but you cannot use graph

268
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,719
queries unless you have a graph database

269
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,240
so we designed a low-level

270
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,720
data model to support this and the data

271
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,800
model consists of objects

272
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,000
that are global unique by value

273
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,360
and this is an example it's

274
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,760
write an address that has object type

275
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,720
ipd4

276
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,120
and value 127.001

277
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,800
and that's all information there is on

278
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,120
this object

279
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,880
it's only the type and the value

280
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,560
and it's unique by the title value

281
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,720
convolution only interesting information

282
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,399
is stored as facts

283
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,640
and facts can be connected to a single

284
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,560
object like this

285
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,360
here's a fact of type category that has

286
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,200
the value loopback

287
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,760
it tells you that this ip address has

288
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,560
category

289
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,399
loopback or they can connect two objects

290
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,240
and that's a relation or an edge in a

291
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,640
graph this fact tells you that the fully

292
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
qualified domain name through.com

293
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,279
resolves to ipv4 address 12701

294
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,360
the facts and data model are immutable

295
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,800
that means they cannot be

296
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
modified or deleted once they're added

297
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,160
to the platform

298
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,240
if you do realize that it's wrong you

299
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,279
can retract it

300
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,680
that's basically adding a new fact

301
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,120
saying that this was wrong

302
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,600
by retracting and every fact is time

303
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,040
stuff and the combination of

304
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,000
immunitability and timestamps

305
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,640
gives you the ability to rewind time so

306
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,760
if you made a decision three months ago

307
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,040
and you're wondering what kind of

308
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,200
information did i have then you can just

309
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,880
rewind time by three months and you can

310
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,480
see exactly what kind of information you

311
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,639
have

312
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,279
every fact as an owner that's important

313
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,760
for multi-tenancy

314
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,839
every single fact supports role based on

315
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,720
explicit taxes control

316
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,519
and every fact can be backed by evidence

317
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,959
and comments

318
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,320
and finally every fact has a region

319
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,279
or source and every source has a trust

320
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,120
rating which you set yourself

321
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,200
it's a value between zero and one how

322
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,639
much you trust the source so if you have

323
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,360
100

324
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,839
trust in the source then the value is

325
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,680
one and every fact supports

326
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,040
confidence so if the source says i'm 100

327
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,720
confidence that this is correct then the

328
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,920
confidence score will be 1.

329
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,639
finally the product of those two gives

330
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,399
you a certainty

331
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,800
so every fact stories trust confidence

332
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
uncertainty

333
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,600
in order to implement this um

334
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,000
we created the scheme our ontology where

335
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,040
we define the

336
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,480
object types and the fact types and

337
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,959
which objects each factor could connect

338
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,880
and this is available on the url at the

339
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,600
bottom of the slide

340
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,120
and this is basically this is just a

341
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,639
subset of the the

342
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,480
ontology but the goal here was to

343
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,800
represent knowledge

344
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,839
and to facilitate more advanced analysis

345
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,279
traversals and to allow us to build

346
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,360
bridges between technical tactical

347
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,160
operational and strategic threatened

348
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,200
options

349
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,279
i'll get back to that bridge building in

350
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,360
a short while

351
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,480
but the next lesson learned was

352
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,839
pivots can be very useful

353
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,399
you can pivot on objects and what that

354
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,120
does is

355
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,760
to let you find related information and

356
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,480
give you more context

357
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,880
the canonical example or a simple

358
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,040
example of pivoting is from dns or

359
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,000
passive dns

360
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,600
you start with a domain name you find

361
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,279
all of the i purposes that it has

362
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,480
resolved to

363
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,480
and then you find all other domain names

364
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,720
that are resolved to those ad campuses

365
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,560
and then you can keep going like that

366
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,240
when you do that you quickly run into

367
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,160
issues because of sinkholes

368
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,440
domain parking shared hosting uh which

369
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,760
can very quickly lead you straight

370
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,199
so for that kind of pivoting you need to

371
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,720
classify and you need to label the

372
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,440
addresses

373
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,199
so that you can filter them out during a

374
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,800
graph traversal

375
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,560
but that's a very very simple example

376
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,839
one more interesting one

377
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,920
is um you can create unconventions

378
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,120
this is an example from urls uh given a

379
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,079
url we split

380
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,600
it so you have the host

381
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,279
or fqdmr ip address as a separate object

382
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,199
you have the path as a separate object

383
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,040
and you have the query parameters

384
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,279
as a separator and that proved useful

385
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,120
when we were tracking phishing campaigns

386
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,000
because

387
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,760
some of these campaigns would reuse

388
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,440
their phishing kits so for every spam

389
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,480
run they would

390
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,760
change the domain name they would change

391
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,040
the path

392
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,600
but they would reuse the query so by

393
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,680
pivoting on that

394
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,199
we could track them over time and

395
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,440
the lesson learned there is try to

396
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,040
identify new

397
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,399
pivot points and exploit them

398
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,959
and if you find a pivot point in a graph

399
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:09,920
representation

400
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,639
that should be an object because you

401
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,519
need

402
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,000
objects to be able to pivot in a graph

403
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,560
conversion

404
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,000
another observation that we made early

405
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,480
on was that

406
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,639
we built a threat graph and that graph

407
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,959
ended up being a series of islands

408
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,160
or sub-graphs that were not connected

409
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,920
so we had lots of small graphs here and

410
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,279
there and we wanted to be able to

411
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,560
connect with them

412
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,920
and the simple solution to that was

413
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,399
enrichment so you see an ip address you

414
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,480
look up and passive dns

415
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,759
to find all the domains that are

416
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,199
resolved to it and then you add that

417
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,360
information

418
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,160
and we kept adding more enrichment

419
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,839
sources

420
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,199
and the graph gradually became more and

421
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,000
more connected and we could find new

422
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,199
connections between clusters of

423
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,160
information that

424
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,279
initially were separate that's also very

425
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,680
simple one more

426
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,480
maybe interesting or advanced solution

427
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:06,880
was

428
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,600
using classifiers to be able to bridge

429
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,000
technical tactical operational strategic

430
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,160
threat intelligence

431
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,279
this is an example of using virustotal

432
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,079
to bridge technical indicators to

433
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,399
tactical information in mitra attack

434
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,279
so consider this sha-256 sum it

435
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,160
represents

436
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,600
file which is on virustop

437
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,639
and to the left you see one of the

438
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,079
antivirus signatures

439
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,839
that i've triggered on this file trojan

440
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,759
downloader win32

441
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,560
zebrazy and on the right you see the

442
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,120
software entry in mitre attack for

443
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,519
zebras

444
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,079
so from virustotal

445
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,720
when we receive a file hash we enrich it

446
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,839
using virustotal

447
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,399
so we look it up and we find that this

448
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,680
signature is triggered

449
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,680
we extract the malware family name

450
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,560
zebrazy and we lowercase it to normalize

451
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:02,880
it

452
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,079
so we end up with an object of type 2

453
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,520
value separate previously we've imported

454
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,959
mitre attacks

455
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,079
which has a software entry for zebra z

456
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,559
we do the same thing there lowercase it

457
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,799
and create a tool object called with the

458
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,280
value

459
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,839
separation now since objects are unique

460
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,359
by value

461
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,240
then these two are the same object and

462
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,000
that actually links the information from

463
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,840
aristotle to the information from

464
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,799
attacked automatically

465
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,679
so antivirus energies on virus total are

466
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,720
classifiers

467
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,320
it's also possible to find other

468
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,400
classifiers and that can be

469
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,039
incredibly useful because it lets you

470
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,640
build bridges between the different

471
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,160
categories of threat intelligence you

472
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
can also go from tactical to strategic

473
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,240
for instance

474
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,160
and that gives you a much more

475
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,320
comprehensive comprehensive context on

476
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,280
what you're observing here now

477
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,120
so this is what it looks like in the act

478
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,799
threat graph in the bottom there you

479
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,400
have the

480
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,960
the file hash which is classified as

481
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,160
zebra z

482
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,000
and then there's a link to the threat

483
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
director att28 with all of the aliases

484
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,640
so this works very well as long as you

485
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,880
use the same name for things but

486
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,960
in reality there are multiple names for

487
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,640
the same albury family and there are

488
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,120
multiple names for the same threat actor

489
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,960
and that creates problems for this

490
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,200
bridge building so we needed a solution

491
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,799
for that

492
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,160
how do we handle the many different

493
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,559
names

494
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,960
so the solution is obvious and it's like

495
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,640
everyone does basically

496
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,559
use aliases so in this case sophisy is

497
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,919
an alias for a to d28

498
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,799
now the more subtle thing here is that

499
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,799
we started out selecting a canonical

500
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,320
name for each that actor and each

501
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,360
malware family

502
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,640
and then we connected all the

503
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,480
information to that name so

504
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,240
if we got we selected apt-28 as

505
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,960
our canonical name for this protector if

506
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,720
we got information about sophisy we

507
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,200
would

508
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,320
connect that to the apt-28 document

509
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,760
same thing if we get the information

510
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,360
about fancy beer we would also connect

511
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,760
it to apd28

512
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,840
another while later we realized that

513
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,520
that was probably one of the biggest

514
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,799
mistakes we did

515
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,320
because information could be wrong

516
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,960
so if you don't at some point in the

517
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,600
future

518
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,480
realize that sofa c is not actually an

519
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,120
alias for 80.

520
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,960
then you have a huge mess to clean up if

521
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,640
you connected all the information to

522
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,919
apd20

523
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,960
so the way we solved it was only attach

524
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
information to the name given

525
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,760
from the source not to a canonical line

526
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,360
so if we receive the information about

527
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,200
sulfusy we attach it to the surface

528
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,080
object

529
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,160
receive information about submit we

530
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,840
attach it to the submit object

531
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,720
then if at some point you realize an

532
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,679
alias is wrong

533
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,440
all you need to do is to retract that

534
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
single alias and all the rest of your

535
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,240
information

536
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,200
is still correct

537
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,960
now when we do the graph analytics

538
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,080
we solve this by traversing all

539
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,400
aliases whenever we hit an object that

540
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
supports aliases so if we do a

541
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,720
graph traversal and we hit a thread

542
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,600
vector object

543
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,159
before we do anything more we find all

544
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,919
of the aliases

545
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,159
and collect all of the threat factor

546
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,240
objects that are aliases for the object

547
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,039
you

548
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,440
found and then you continue the graph

549
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,679
traversal from the set of threat actor

550
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,200
objects rather than from the single

551
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,559
attacker object and in that way the

552
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,280
aliases

553
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,320
acts as an intermediary bridge

554
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
which also lets you correlate

555
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,240
information from different sources that

556
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
might use different canonical names for

557
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,799
the same

558
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,520
thread this work on bridge building and

559
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,799
aliases actually uncovered a range of

560
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,600
data and information quality issues in

561
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,840
important sources of threat intelligence

562
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,840
so the first one is about naming things

563
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,120
which is hard

564
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,640
and it's especially hard when you want

565
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,520
to do automated processing and analysis

566
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,919
of information from multiple different

567
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,000
sources

568
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,520
one very useful tool to help you do that

569
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,240
is vocabularies and this is an example

570
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,400
from sticks 2.0 the industry sector

571
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,039
vocabulary

572
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,000
this vocabulary is not perfect like

573
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,679
where do you place a law firm

574
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,720
but it's useful because

575
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,799
it lets you correlate and tailor it on

576
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,799
information from different sources

577
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,360
so if everyone uses this vocabulary we

578
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,240
know that

579
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,520
if it's something targeting the

580
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,880
healthcare industry then it will be

581
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,799
called healthcare

582
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,600
and given our data model that means all

583
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,440
of the information will be connected to

584
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,080
the same

585
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,440
sector objects so one example

586
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,480
this is a really great resource from

587
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,840
tycert the threat group cards

588
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,360
and if you're not using this i suggest

589
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,280
you try

590
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,360
try it out they have collected

591
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,400
information on threat actors aliases

592
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,280
malware families

593
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,559
operations or campaigns

594
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,400
sectors that they target and

595
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
geographical areas that they target

596
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,360
now the sectors there with initially it

597
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,559
looked like they were using the stixx

598
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,760
vocabulary but then

599
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,360
when we went into more detail we would

600
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,440
find things like political dissidence

601
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,520
and forbes sector or large domestic

602
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,280
companies a multinational corporation

603
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,240
branches sector

604
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,000
or electronics and journalists

605
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,159
so it's a really great resource but it

606
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,240
could be even better if they

607
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,799
chose the vocabulary and stuck to it

608
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,080
because then it would be easier to

609
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,480
process

610
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,720
next lesson was central aspiration

611
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,200
versus community efforts

612
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,360
in the early project stages we used both

613
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,720
micro attack and miss

614
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,200
galaxy as sources from albert family and

615
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,880
threat actresses

616
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,640
but we found so many

617
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,600
quality issues like sever two different

618
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,240
threat diagrams with the alias apt-17

619
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,039
in this galaxy that at some point we

620
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,000
stopped using it

621
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,960
because it was adding wrong information

622
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,440
to our knowledge base

623
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,520
one reason for that might be that attack

624
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,919
has a very very strict curation

625
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,840
and requires references for all

626
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,559
information

627
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,159
and that might not be possible to

628
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,200
achieve with a commute effort

629
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,640
where you don't have centralized

630
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,840
curation of the information

631
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,240
so

632
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,159
automated consumption of threat

633
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,840
intelligence is hard

634
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,279
and that indicates to us that this

635
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,720
using these techniques to

636
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,039
automatically enrich and build bridges

637
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,159
is not widely used

638
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,799
and we've been trying to figure out why

639
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:09,279
but

640
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,080
one of the reasons might be that there's

641
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,360
a general consensus

642
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,279
in the threat intel community that we

643
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,279
don't share enough threat intelligence

644
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,880
thus we must remove the barriers to

645
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,320
sharing thus

646
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,000
the standards must be flexible it might

647
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,919
be easy to share

648
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,760
the problem with that is if you make it

649
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,840
easy to share you make it harder to

650
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,240
consume

651
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,240
because if you want to make it easy to

652
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,760
consume this automatically you need to

653
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,799
be strict

654
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,240
you need to represent information

655
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,679
in the same way every time

656
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,720
and for every piece of threat

657
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,840
information

658
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,640
produced it might be consumed hundreds

659
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,880
or thousands of times

660
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,200
so making it difficult to consume to

661
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,480
make it easier to produce

662
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,559
is not scalable or efficient

663
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,840
finally trust and confidence um

664
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,279
relations and threat intelligence are

665
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,400
not binary they may might be uncertain

666
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,200
wrong or missing so to manage

667
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,799
uncertainty as i mentioned we

668
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,240
implemented the trust score french

669
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,600
information sources

670
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,919
a confidence score for each relation and

671
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,279
then the certainty score which is the

672
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,400
product

673
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,520
and the key observation there was that

674
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,960
almost none of the sources that we

675
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,400
imported had any kind of confidence

676
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:26,960
course

677
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,039
in a machine readable format and

678
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,200
antivirus engines such as their

679
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,240
classifiers

680
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,679
they could have provided the confidence

681
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,360
score but they don't

682
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,279
so that leaves us with guessing

683
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,120
how certain is this av engine but this

684
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,799
is actually not motor family

685
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,000
we don't know oh could you come

686
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,080
to a close end or maybe

687
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,480
yeah i'm almost there so i just hope i

688
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,679
don't come across as

689
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,360
arrogant or bitter or difficult or

690
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,679
anything uh i think that we can do this

691
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,400
better

692
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,640
i think that the necessary changes are

693
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,159
manageable and that the results are

694
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:06,720
valuable

695
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,120
because given the i platform you can

696
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,520
give it an ip address you can get

697
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,760
using a graph query malware family names

698
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,360
command and control infrastructure

699
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,440
downloads threat directors techniques

700
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
incidents signatures

701
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,720
reports that mention it and

702
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,240
the way to achieve that is to share

703
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,480
information as triplets

704
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,960
source object relation destination think

705
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,679
relations when you share information

706
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,840
don't think data and finally the road

707
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,720
ahead

708
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,600
we are also participating in a new

709
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,200
project called socrates where

710
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,880
we develop a security automation and

711
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,640
decision support platform for

712
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,919
uh socks and incident responders

713
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,000
and as part of that we're developing the

714
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,760
act platform

715
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,279
with a focus on tactical threat

716
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,799
intelligence and we're trying to be able

717
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,640
to automatically generate adversary

718
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,080
emulation plans

719
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,320
and currently we're sequencing attack

720
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,200
techniques

721
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,799
by defining preconditions post

722
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,400
conditions so you can create attack

723
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,919
chains automatically

724
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,679
that project has a stakeholder group

725
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,039
we're looking for

726
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,000
interested parties that would like to uh

727
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,679
participate in the stakeholding group

728
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,840
so if you are if if you think that

729
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,799
sounds interesting

730
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,039
just have a look at the website and we

731
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,360
also have the delivery

732
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,960
and finally the app platform is open

733
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,720
source it's on github it's

734
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,200
ic license and we also have a public aws

735
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,960
instance read only with only open source

736
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,840
intelligence

737
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,279
if you just want to test it that's it

738
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,520
for me

739
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,039
okay thank you martin um

740
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,000
there are three questions or rather one

741
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,120
comment it seems

742
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,279
and actually now three questions so

743
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,279
first one is from

744
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,559
woodpendra singh facts should also

745
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,840
be associated with a ttl time to live

746
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,840
yes you can i mean we don't have native

747
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,080
support for it in a data model

748
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,600
but you do have a timestamp you know

749
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,760
when that information was added

750
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,000
and you can handle ttl on the outside so

751
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,840
if you want to export information to a

752
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,559
reputation system or to a firewall

753
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,960
uh that could be handled on the outside

754
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,399
of the platform because you have all the

755
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,120
information you need

756
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,840
okay thanks then the next question is

757
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,240
from andrew cormack

758
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,320
does grinder access control on

759
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,840
individual facts risk

760
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,279
a cutting graph or conversely be

761
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,559
allowing unintended access interferences

762
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,200
across around a cut it feels quite hard

763
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,640
to foresee the effect

764
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,799
of granting or refusing access

765
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,039
you grant or refuse access to

766
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,320
each fact separately so yes in the case

767
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,480
you might cut the graph if you don't

768
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,760
have i mean if you don't have

769
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,320
access to that single fact with bridges

770
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,080
two subgraphs then you will see it as

771
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,600
two separate subgroups

772
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,159
okay then the next question is thanks

773
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,760
the next question is by

774
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,120
patrick forsberg how do you solve name

775
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,000
clashes

776
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,640
if for instance it turns out that

777
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,200
virustotalbin32

778
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,640
sabre c isn't the same as the attack

779
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,880
version we don't have a so i don't think

780
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,799
there's a solution for that

781
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,960
basically if you if you use the exact

782
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,600
same name

783
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,120
then we don't have a solution for it now

784
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,320
okay would maybe be adding

785
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,760
adding the source to the name or

786
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,360
something

787
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,320
kind of the the uh the facts are the

788
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:40,960
source

789
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,399
so anything connected to that the object

790
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,679
is unique by name

791
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,760
but anything connected to the object

792
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,600
will also have a source

793
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,000
okay so if the oversee has an alias to

794
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,279
another tool object

795
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,120
and that might come from mighty attack

796
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,799
and attack will be the

797
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,360
source or the origin for that fact

798
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,440
whereas if you have a sample classified

799
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
as cyber c that has another origin

800
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,720
which could be virus so they're

801
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,320
distinguishable but uh we don't natively

802
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,600
uh handle that name commission

803
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,440
no okay thanks then the next is by

804
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,240
philippe

805
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,360
storchkovsky why did you decide on

806
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,360
confidence scores from feed sources

807
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,200
rather than building your own score

808
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,279
engine based on the threat data context

809
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,600
because our own evaluation is um

810
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,399
they're not mutually exclusive first off

811
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,039
but our

812
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,159
our own evaluation is for each source

813
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,760
we assign a trust score how much do we

814
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,360
trust this source

815
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,640
and then we support that the

816
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,720
source can set the confidence score for

817
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,840
every fact that we receive

818
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,320
and finally we compute the certainty

819
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,039
based on that but

820
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,320
we could have analysis workers that add

821
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,360
new information

822
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,200
and set a different confidence score

823
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,600
given the context so you analyze the

824
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,440
not each single fact that you analyze

825
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,720
this in context with all the other

826
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,679
information you have

827
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,360
but the way you would do that is create

828
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,000
new facts you wouldn't modify what's in

829
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,519
there already

830
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,399
that's kind of falsifying history but

831
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,440
you would create new facts

832
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,480
okay thanks a lot then amit

833
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,159
musad asks can you put some light on

834
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,760
ics slash ot scada specific threat

835
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,960
intel sources well

836
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,320
we're gonna at least import uh attack

837
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,080
for ses

838
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,640
but i mean the threat into a platform is

839
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,600
not

840
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
exclusively for enterprise networks or

841
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,279
for ics networks

842
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,799
this um we haven't done the data

843
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:55,919
modeling for

844
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,120
ics specific things but that's

845
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,000
definitely something

846
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,279
we're looking into in the future

847
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,399
okay so there seems to be a lot of

848
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,200
potential

849
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,360
um thanks a lot again martin for

850
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,480
presenting this as

851
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,039
usual once the questions get going then

852
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,720
the things become

853
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,799
interesting sadly the time is over me

854
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,440
move on to the next session

855
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,760
