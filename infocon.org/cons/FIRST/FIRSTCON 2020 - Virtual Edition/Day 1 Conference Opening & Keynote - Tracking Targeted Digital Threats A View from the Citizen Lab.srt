you to the opening of the 2020

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,360
annual first conference to be honest

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,480
when i was chosen to be the chair in

25
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,399
2019 in edinburgh i didn't really

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,120
imagine

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,399
opening the 2020 conference this way

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,400
and i'm sure the same is true for our

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,240
conference chair derrick charles

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,360
so derek

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,400
eric promised me he's gonna vape to all

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,360
of us sorry about that because 2020 zoom

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,040
picked exactly the right moment to crash

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,240
anyways it's 2020 so here we go

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,280
like the first conference team has tried

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,640
very hard to make this

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,680
an in-person meeting and but alas

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,079
viruses don't respect our efforts this

39
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,680
seems to be true in uh

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,240
the digital world but also in the real

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,200
world

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,040
but there's actually a good side to all

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,119
of this this is the largest ever first

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,360
conference we've had we have more than

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,759
2 000 registered participate

46
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,960
participants

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,360
from over 100 countries and with over 71

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,600
first-time attendees we're reaching out

49
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,640
further than ever

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,399
in line with our mission to connect

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,560
instance responders around the globe

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,119
so i think this pandemic actually taught

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,719
us how we can

54
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,439
connect to people that aren't able to

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,880
come to our events

56
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,160
in any case a big welcome to all of you

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,400
what has not changed from the past year

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,239
though is the outstanding quality of the

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:14,800
program

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,280

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,400
this event is just

64
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,959
another click the zoom link type thingy

65
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,879
but running an event on zoom with over

66
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,959
2000 participants is not something you

67
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,680
do on a rainy saturday afternoon

68
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,239

it has been an incredible journey that

89
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,239
for me

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,480
it started in kuala lumpur back in 2018

91
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,400
and i never imagined that we would have

92
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
to prepare two different programs for

93
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,640
one conference

94
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
many people contributed to make this

95
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,840
event possible

96
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,720
and i wanted to start by saying many

97
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,280

98
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,319
to the 2020 program committee all the

99
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,599
speakers

100
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,640
and the first events team and also

101
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,480
to the board well it seems that

102
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,040
different viruses in some way play a

103
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,159
role in our

104
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,400
community history in 1988 in a computer

105
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,959
world

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,120
led to the birth of the computer

107
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,599
security incident response teams

108
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,319
third years ago first was formed to

109
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:08,879
bring

110
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,879
response teams together and improve

111
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,319
coordination

112
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,599
in 2020 a biological virus does not

113
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,798
allow us

114
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,839
to meet in person but each other we grew

115
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,400
a strong community that cooperates and

116
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,759
share in the most adverse conditions

117

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,560
nerve-racking screen share

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,520
and voila everything okay

175
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,199
you can see yep looks good okay good

176
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,280
so thank you it's a great honor to

177
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,800
present at first and

178
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,199
um you know this is something i've hoped

179
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,039
to do for a very long time

180
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,080
um in my presentation today um

181
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,080
i i want to begin by just uh for those

182
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,599
of you who don't know about the citizen

183
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,000
lab

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,319
uh beyond what lucy said in her

185
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,759
introduction we do

186
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,160
research on digital security issues that

187
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,720
arise out of human rights concerns so

188
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,120
we don't cover the entire landscape of

189
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,400
cyber security

190
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,960
instead we focus in particular on those

191
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,240
issues that affect

192
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,080
average citizens instead of say

193
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,639
businesses and governments

194
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,479
the signature of the citizen lab is our

195
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,919
mixture of methods

196
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,960
so i'm a social scientist by background

197
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,599
but many of the staff at the citizen lab

198
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,360
the researchers come from different

199
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,400
disciplines

200
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,120
we especially leverage computer science

201
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,280
engineering science and law

202
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,680
policy analysis to do the type of work

203
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,880
that we do

204
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,120
we're not an advocacy group we see

205
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,000
ourselves

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,720
as and our mission as putting forward

207
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,319
evidence in the public interest

208
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,599
so we are kind of a digital watchdog is

209
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,440
the best way to think about it

210
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,400
we've been around for well over um uh

211
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,479
close to two decades now actually and

212
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,599
have covered a wide variety of topics

213
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,680
today what i'm going to do is focus in

214
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,720
particular

215
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,039
on our work on targeted digital

216
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,240
espionage or targeted threats we call it

217
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,440
this area is led by senior researchers

218
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:11,759
bill

219
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,280
marzak john scott railton and

220
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,240
masashi nishihata as well as a variety

221
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,759
of other people

222
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,560
on the team so what i'm going to do is

223
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,560
kind of walk through a few stories

224
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,199
of the research in this area what we do

225
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,319
how we do it

226
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,520
and then take a step back to

227
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,479
discuss what the evidence shows and the

228
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,479
bottom line here is that i think there

229
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,519
is a major

230
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,559
crisis in global civil society

231
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,440
and by extension liberal democracy

232
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,040
because of rising threats

233
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,480
around um the type of activities that

234
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,680
i'm going to describe

235
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,959
in my talk today so i want to end by um

236
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,959
having a short discussion about some

237
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,200
ways we could respond to these threats

238
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,000
especially

239
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
uh the first community which i think is

240
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,839
a critical

241
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,040
to uh remedying some of the problems

242
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,399
excuse me that uh we see in our research

243
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,680
so to begin uh our research often begins

244
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,240
with we

245
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,640
we call a patient zero uh somebody like

246
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
ahmad mansur

247
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,399
he was a human rights defender in the

248
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,240
united arab emirates

249
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,320
back in 2016 uh ahmad received these two

250
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,560
text messages on his iphone purporting

251
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,320
to show evidence of torture

252
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,480
in emirati prisons it'd be the type of

253
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,800
thing that as a human rights defender

254
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,680
he might be tempted to click on instead

255
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,800
he was suspicious

256
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,839
of those messages thankfully and decided

257
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,040
to forward them

258
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,839
to bill marzak senior researcher at the

259
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,360
citizen lab

260
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,480
bill requisitioned a used iphone

261
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,120
and in a laboratory setting uh managed

262
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,839
to infect

263
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,279
his own device um and what he discovered

264
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,640
was uh that he was able to uh get a copy

265
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,360
of of the

266
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,399
of the spyware uh which was connected to

267
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,720
an israeli-based spyware company called

268
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,320
nso group

269
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,240
bill and the other members of our team

270
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,680
had been tracking some of the

271
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
infrastructure of nso group

272
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,760
but this was of course the first time

273
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,040
that we managed to

274
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,160
successfully acquire uh the spyware

275
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,440
itself infect our own device and reverse

276
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,480
engineer it

277
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,519
um at the time nso group was uh

278
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,279
very shy of the media as understandably

279
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,600
this is a marketplace that tends to

280
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,920
operate in the shadows

281
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,079
of course now they're very much out

282
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,200
there in the media

283
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,240
ironically in part because of citizen

284
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
labs research

285
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,079
when they do speak to the media they're

286
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,680
pretty consistent about what they say

287
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,920
they say we only sell to governments and

288
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,160
we follow israeli and local laws

289
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,360
that's 100 true i would say

290
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,200
but they also say that their technology

291
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,160
is strictly controlled to investigate

292
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,800
serious matters of crime terrorism and

293
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,160
so forth

294
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,640
the problem really lies in this third

295
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,959
statement so what we have discovered is

296
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:09,680
that

297
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,320
while they claim their technology is

298
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,079
sold to investigate these very

299
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,640
serious matters the problem is their

300
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,600
clients

301
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,560
define those terms in extremely broad

302
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,120
ways

303
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,160
to cover uh virtually anything

304
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,839
including journalists human rights

305
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,720
defenders lawyers and so on

306
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,519
now as i said we were able to get a copy

307
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,120
of the spyware

308
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,640
at the time and um had ahmad mansour

309
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,440
clicked on

310
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,760
those links his iphone would have been

311
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
infected by what were then

312
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,240
three separate apple zero days of course

313
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,880
very powerful technology that could

314
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,120
eavesdrop on everything that he was

315
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,560
doing on his device

316
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,600
including most importantly intercepting

317
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,959
his emails and sms

318
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,720
messages even those that are end-to-end

319
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,200
encrypted uh which is an important

320
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,959
marketing feature of this type of

321
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,399
spyware and

322
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,680
turn on the audio capture video capture

323
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,160
systems and track his movements and all

324
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,760
of his contacts so

325
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,200
obviously very powerful technology

326
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,600
i want to point out that we when we

327
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,160
discovered the spyware and the zero days

328
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,360
we promptly

329
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,079
did a responsible disclosure to apple

330
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:24,480
and

331
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,800
there was a remarkable turnaround on the

332
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,079
patch for this so

333
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,320
ahmad gave us those text messages on

334
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,760
august 11th

335
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,360
2016 and uh two weeks later uh apple

336
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,760
post

337
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,079
pushed out pushed out the security

338
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,000
update affecting approximately

339
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,639
a billion devices worldwide so for us

340
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,639
that was a very satisfying

341
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,959
uh outcome to that particular research

342
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,720
project one of the biggest

343
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,200
uh in the history of the citizen lab i'd

344
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,880
say

345
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,839
now the other way that we work is uh

346
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:56,959
often by

347
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,079
partnering with local ngos inside

348
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,959
countries uh that we're interested in

349
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,240
investigating and

350
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,360
we had some um some some

351
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,519
data some evidence suggesting there was

352
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,279
a lot of nso targeting

353
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,560
in mexico and so what we did is

354
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,600
uh partner with local human rights

355
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,720
organizations

356
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,120
and in particular our senior researcher

357
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,560
john scott railton

358
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,040
got in touch with uh this person luis

359
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,800
fernando garcia

360
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,880
and explained to him what we are looking

361
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,959
for is artifacts

362
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,600
that show us a person has been targeted

363
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,160
and

364
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,120
and the the the achilles heel if you

365
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,519
will

366
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,920
of of the spyware technology that we're

367
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,120
investigating

368
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,440
are the artifacts that come in the form

369
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,880
of shortened links on

370
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,680
sms messages or emails or whatever that

371
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,959
we can link

372
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,680
to the company's uh infrastructure and

373
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,120
confidently say

374
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,839
yes this person was targeted um not

375
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,920
necessarily that their their device was

376
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,839
infected because the spyware is very

377
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,880
stealthy

378
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,360
um but the evidence of targeting is

379
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,279
significant enough because you can say

380
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,320
that there are

381
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,800
no controls this is the case that we

382
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,399
want to emphasize

383
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,199
so beginning in 2017 we did this in

384
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,440
mexico and found

385
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,720
really quite a widespread

386
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,920
reckless abuse of nso's targeting here's

387
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,079
just a few samples of some of the

388
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,240
you know salacious text messages that

389
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,760
were sent to people

390
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,519
trying to alarm them you know

391
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,440
make them anxious so that they might

392
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,800
click on a link

393
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,480
the one in the bottom middle i think is

394
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,240
a good illustration of that you've

395
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
probably all seen something like this

396
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,639
you know mr simon your daughter was in

397
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,160
an accident um

398
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
you know she's in grave condition click

399
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,839
on this link etc

400
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,199
you know a lot of people with children

401
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,279
would be tempted to click on this link

402
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,519
you know so it's highly personalized

403
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,480
it's um

404
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,240
you know tailored to this particular

405
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,519
person uh

406
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,240
even the daughter's accurate name is

407
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,959
mentioned

408
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,880
so there's a bit of effort that's put

409
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,639
into um

410
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,480
the social engineering part of the

411
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,680
equation

412
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,480
um as i said the the case in mexico was

413
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,880
was quite horrible and i want to just

414
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,279
illustrate something here recall that

415
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:15,920
nso

416
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,480
markets its technology under the

417
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,279
auspices

418
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,680
of helping governments fight serious

419
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,079
matters of crime and terrorism

420
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,079
and what they have done in their

421
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,440
marketing is

422
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,600
trumpet the fact that their technology

423
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,440
was used in mexico

424
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,079
to help investigate uh serious issues

425
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,000
around the drug cartels

426
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,560
well what we found is that investigative

427
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,600
journalists

428
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,800
who were investigating collusion between

429
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,560
the government and cartels and

430
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,279
corruption

431
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,320
involving mexican cartels

432
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,880
were themselves targeted with this type

433
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,000
of spyware

434
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,959
including this unfortunate person javier

435
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,880
hardanas who is an investigative

436
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,600
journalist

437
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,680
covering um the drug cartels in mexico

438
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,079
he was murdered in broad daylight on the

439
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:04,800
street

440
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,079
and within a couple of days his

441
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,959
uh colleague at the newspaper where he

442
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:11,680
worked

443
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,120
uh received uh spyware messages

444
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,639
um as did his wife who was

445
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,360
um in mourning um so it goes to show

446
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,279
that the controls around this in the

447
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,600
context of mexico were horrible

448
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,720
over the course of uh two years roughly

449
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,600
two years

450
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,079
we discovered more than uh 25 targets

451
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,199
in civil society including journalists

452
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,240
and their family members lawyers

453
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,480
public health advocates people who are

454
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,000
advocating for

455
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,120
uh attacks on sugary beverages to to

456
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,440
help with the obesity problem in mexico

457
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,519
were even targeted with this spyware

458
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,079
of course government opposition figures

459
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,399
anti-corruption investigators

460
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,639
even international investigators into

461
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,880
mass disappearances

462
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,199
so what we see here is reckless

463
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,079
targeting

464
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,119
and serial abuses and i would go so far

465
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:07,839
as to say

466
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,240
what happens in mexico what we saw over

467
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,079
that roughly two year period

468
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,720
is symptomatic of a global problem here

469
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,520
you have

470
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,160
governments that are all too willing to

471
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,880
purchase this very sophisticated spyware

472
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,280
but when it comes to how they are going

473
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,160
to use it

474
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,400
who they are going to target there are

475
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,199
very few

476
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,480
if any controls and as a consequence of

477
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,160
the fact that many governments

478
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,440
lack public accountability lack proper

479
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,160
oversight independent oversight even

480
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,000
something so basic as warranting

481
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,880
processes

482
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,559
are often absent authoritarian regimes

483
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,600
autocrats kleptocrats they are going to

484
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,400
go after

485
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,880
what they consider to be any threat to

486
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,080
their regime

487
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,400
journalists especially human rights

488
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,120
defenders

489
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,320
opposition figures now

490
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,000
there's a another way in which we go

491
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,919
about the research which is more

492
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,360
on the network infrastructure level so

493
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,480
um you know here's a stylized diagram of

494
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,200
how

495
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,480
companies like uh nso structure

496
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,720
uh their products and services in order

497
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,480
to obfuscate as best they can

498
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,120
the the infrastructure that they provide

499
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,520
to

500
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,919
their government clients the problem of

501
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,679
course is that

502
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,520
just like everyone else on the internet

503
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,440
even the spyware companies

504
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,720
leave trails and over many years we've

505
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,880
developed a variety of methods using

506
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,480
different data sources

507
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,000
to effectively track this infrastructure

508
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,720
and in some cases identify who the

509
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,280
government

510
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,559
clients are using both network scanning

511
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,039
data as well as open source intelligence

512
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:49,840
methods

513
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,200
and we've done this with a number of

514
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,280
spyware companies over the years

515
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,000
perhaps many people will be familiar

516
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,280
with these pictures

517
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,080
with these diagrams so here's uh an

518
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,840
example of one report we did in 2014

519
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,919
with the then italian based italy-based

520
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,559
spyware company hacking team and the

521
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,160
picture that you see here is a very

522
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,520
disturbing one

523
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,799
why because of the government clients

524
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,120
of hacking team spyware at that time

525
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
that we could identify through this

526
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,480
network scanning type of project

527
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,120
we could see that many of them are among

528
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
the world's worst abusers

529
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,760
of human rights the following year we

530
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,559
did the same thing with finn fisher

531
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,760
which is german swiss

532
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,799
uk company depending on convenience and

533
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,640
other factors for them

534
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,600
um and here it's even a worse picture

535
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,440
that we see

536
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,440
with nso group led by bill marzack

537
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,320
on using his dns cache probing

538
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,760
techniques

539
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,120
we undertook a similar global scanning

540
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,240
for nso's infrastructure

541
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,159
getting a good sense of who the various

542
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,679
government clients are

543
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,559
and where there were infected devices

544
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,280
globally

545
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,039
so what you're seeing with this map is

546
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,679
not the government clients per se

547
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,280
what you're seeing are the countries

548
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,120
within which we know

549
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120
there are infected devices in other

550
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,039
words where there is espionage

551
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,400
taking place and we

552
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,240
were able to resolve these espionage

553
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,120
espionage operations to more than 30

554
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,919
government

555
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,880
client groups so we published that in

556
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,400
2018

557
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,480
and in that report there was a very

558
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,600
significant

559
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,640
operator group that stood out for us

560
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,919
and that was saudi arabia as you can see

561
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,000
here there are a number of countries

562
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,960
in which saudi operators were using nso

563
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,840
spyware

564
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,039
to undertake espionage against targets

565
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,440
and the one that stood out for us was of

566
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,039
course canada

567
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,960
what we could see was that there was a

568
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,720
single infected device

569
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,520
uh in canada that was moving pretty

570
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,120
consistently between

571
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,520
two locations connecting from two

572
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,600
different internet service providers

573
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,400
but beyond that beyond that uh vantage

574
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:14,799
point

575
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,960
from our network scanning we had no

576
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,520
information as to who the target was

577
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,679
so what we did was something quite novel

578
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:22,640
for us we

579
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,559
we quite literally went door to door

580
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,640
and and by that i mean we developed a

581
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,600
short list

582
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,240
of suspected targets who would be of

583
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,080
interest to saudi arabia

584
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,679
in canada in the quebec region and

585
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,640
our researcher bill marzack traveled to

586
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,520
quebec

587
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,679
interviewed these people and lo and

588
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,760
behold came across the target

589
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,200
which is this person omar abdulaziz

590
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,400
now at the time omar was a very

591
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,520
prominent critic

592
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,919
of saudi arabia and especially muhammad

593
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,039
bin salman

594
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,480
he uh received um canadian permanent

595
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,960
residency in 2014

596
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,159
and launched a very ambitious social

597
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,679
media campaign

598
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,480
against saudi arabia he has a youtube

599
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,280
channel that's

600
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,240
in a twitter account viewed by millions

601
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,960
where

602
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,240
he basically satirizes uh the regime

603
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,039
so when we met with omar uh bill with

604
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,640
his with omar's consent

605
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,520
looked through his text messages and as

606
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,880
soon as he saw this

607
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,400
uh this domain sundaydeals.com

608
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,919
he knew that omar had been uh targeted

609
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,640
and this message came coincidentally on

610
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,919
a few hours after

611
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,039
omar had made a purchase for protein

612
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:41,760
powder

613
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,960
online and so the dhl shipment the fake

614
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,679
dhl shipment notification tricked him

615
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,600
and he clicked he recalled clicking on

616
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
that link

617
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,159
um the other part of the the um evidence

618
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,799
here was his pattern of movements so

619
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,559
recall that omar

620
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,200
um uh what we could see from our vantage

621
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,159
point was this

622
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,400
infected device checking in from two

623
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,159
different internet service providers at

624
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,080
different times of the day

625
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,480
omar who was a student at bishops

626
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,280
university

627
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,480
in canada was pretty consistent in his

628
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,000
pattern of life if you will

629
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,400
he it was summertime school was not in

630
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,280
session

631
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,520
so in the daytime he would remain in his

632
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,480
apartment

633
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,000
but then every evening pretty

634
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,240
consistently he would go to the gym

635
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,559
at the university and connect to the

636
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,480
internet service provider there

637
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,039
and those details match what we could

638
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,480
see as well

639
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,559
what we didn't know at the time though

640
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,600
was that

641
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,200
omar was a very close confidant of

642
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,360
jamal hashoji the washington post

643
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,039
journalist

644
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,320
so we released our report october 1st

645
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,520
2018 the very next day

646
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,960
jamal hashoji went into the saudi

647
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,919
consulate

648
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,559
in istanbul and of course was promptly

649
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,000
executed

650
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,679
to this day his remains are not known

651
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,679
and the reason i want to pause on this

652
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,080
is to show you the very lethal potential

653
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,320
lethal consequences of this type of

654
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,679
uncontrolled proliferation of spyware

655
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,039
so for many months omar and

656
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,960
jamal khashoggi were in coordination

657
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,520
they were planning a very ambitious

658
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,200
social media activism

659
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,400
against saudi arabia they were saying

660
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,120
quite inflammatory things over whatsapp

661
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,640
they assumed that was safe

662
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,880
because end-to-end encryption of course

663
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,720
the spyware defeated that

664
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,039
and saudi operatives were basically

665
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,880
looking over their shoulder

666
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,679
as omar and jamal were saying things

667
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,080
like

668
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,880
you can see here very provocative from

669
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,120
the perspective of saudi arabia

670
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,520
effectively a death sentence for jamal

671
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,080
ashoji

672
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,240
now moving forward things have become a

673
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,080
bit more difficult for us in our

674
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,520
research given the evolution of nso and

675
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,080
other

676
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,440
spyware companies technology in may

677
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,960
2019 whatsapp discovered

678
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,799
a that nso had exploited a

679
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,159
flaw in its video calling function

680
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,720
allowing them to take over a device

681
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,520
simply by

682
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,520
ringing it up and when this happened

683
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,000
citizenlab volunteered to work with

684
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,559
whatsapp to identify the civil society

685
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,600
targets

686
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,720
of the period of time in which

687
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,600
this was taking place and for which

688
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,200
whatsapp had data

689
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,559
so they gave us data from a two-week

690
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,559
period of targeting

691
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,039
which was roughly i think over about a

692
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:47,919
thousand

693
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,279
targets and um you know starting with

694
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,200
just the phone numbers that whatsapp

695
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,559
could give us

696
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,520
we then went out and did ocean research

697
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,039
and were able to identify

698
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,039
more than a hundred of them who were

699
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,120
clearly civil society targets in other

700
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,600
words

701
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,240
definitely not terrorists or criminals

702
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,200
at least as conventionally understood

703
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,960
given that the way we work under

704
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,960
research protocol research ethics

705
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,840
protocols

706
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
at the university of toronto where we're

707
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,919
based we're not allowed to disclose the

708
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,000
identities of the targets

709
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,400
unless they give us permission or unless

710
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,720
they come forward publicly themselves

711
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,679
and over time many of them have and so i

712
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:28,880
just want to show you

713
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,200
some of the illustrations of the serious

714
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,799
nature of the targeting

715
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,600
we discovered here so among the victims

716
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,000
uh

717
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,799
rwandan opposition figures who were

718
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,360
tracked

719
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,480
by death squads sent out uh by the

720
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,000
president of rwanda

721
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,360
paul kagame were targeted in this manner

722
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,960
in india numerous i think more than 40

723
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,400
targets from opposition figures to

724
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,080
lawyers rep representing marginalized

725
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,799
and threatened

726
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,480
ethnic groups in in india

727
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,440
catalonia case that continues right now

728
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,360
finally some of the

729
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,120
members of the catalan government and

730
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,240
those in exile were targeting including

731
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,640
some

732
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,960
opposition figures who were outside of

733
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,679
spain

734
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,360
at the time when the targeting took

735
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,679
place in places like geneva

736
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,799
for example even uh

737
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,279
roman catholic bishops and a priest were

738
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,399
targeted in

739
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,960
in togo using this type of spyware

740
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,960
so you know what we're seeing here is a

741
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,720
pretty disturbing picture where you have

742
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,200
this

743
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,760
you know very sophisticated technology

744
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,720
being used

745
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,840
uh with virtually no control um

746
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,760
before i move on to what we can do about

747
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,000
it i just want to emphasize one point

748
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,520
that what we see in our research and

749
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,440
many people no doubt who are watching

750
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,679
this presentation see as well

751
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,240
is that you don't need to necessarily

752
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,720
use

753
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,919
high-end spyware to accomplish your

754
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:02,720
objectives

755
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,360
whatever does the trick works uh just

756
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,080
fine

757
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,159
and we as as often as we see

758
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,840
sophisticated spyware

759
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,640
uh we also see things like this for

760
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,520
example

761
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,039
um where um you know attackers are using

762
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,159
uh url shorteners to um

763
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,799
basically go after people's credentials

764
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,679
uh this comes from a report we released

765
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,640
uh earlier this year called dark basin

766
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:28,960
uh

767
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,399
where through an examination

768
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,520
of various url shorteners that were used

769
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,919
by the operators behind this attack

770
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,279
we were able to identify thousands of

771
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,320
targets

772
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,799
in a really what was for us a

773
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,080
bewildering

774
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,200
array of issue areas from

775
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,480
uh financial trading short sellers

776
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,600
divorce divorce lawyers to civil society

777
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,559
targets

778
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,720
and in the course of our investigation

779
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,840
we were able to

780
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,200
resolve all of this down to a

781
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,559
single uh operator based in india called

782
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,840
beltrocks which is um basically a hack

783
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,720
for hire

784
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,279
operation and and the reason i want to

785
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,120
uh point this out is because

786
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,919
you know this is not a uh sophisticated

787
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,919
company what they're doing is you know

788
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,919
about as basic as you can get

789
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,480
a little photoshopping of a dropbox you

790
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
know or other

791
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
cloud-based service to grab people's

792
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,039
credentials but it can be very effective

793
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,480
and what we discovered

794
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,720
was that the data that came from this

795
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,640
hack for hire operation

796
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,240
was used to successfully penetrate

797
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,120
a very large and well-organized

798
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,080
environmental advocacy campaign

799
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,240
involving groups like greenpeace and

800
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,679
climate investigation centers and so on

801
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,440
i will emphasize here we don't know

802
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,919
ultimately who the

803
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,120
client was the ultimate client of this

804
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,720
hack for hire operation

805
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,559
but i can say all of the groups that

806
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,159
were involved in

807
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,880
in the environmental part of this were

808
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,120
part of the exxon new

809
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,559
campaign so let's take a step back and

810
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,559
and look at the broader context and and

811
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,840
why i think this is such

812
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,279
a serious problem um

813
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,320
if you look here um this kind of you

814
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,960
know

815
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,000
captures what i think are the major

816
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,640
um uh characteristics of the

817
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,559
geopolitical environment

818
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,200
within which we live and within which

819
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,279
civil society has to operate

820
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,360
now for you know i've studied uh the

821
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,320
internet and

822
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,960
and global security issues for my entire

823
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,320
professional career for

824
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,880
you know probably 30 years and i can

825
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,880
definitely remember a time at the very

826
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,760
beginning

827
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,080
when everyone simply assumed that the

828
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,039
internet

829
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,840
mobile technology social media would

830
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,640
empower

831
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
civil society would lead to this you

832
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,480
know liberalization

833
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,279
and democratization and what we have

834
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:01,840
seen

835
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,880
uh empirically really over the course of

836
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,200
the research of the citizen lab is a

837
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,720
much different picture

838
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,960
um right now uh we are seeing rising

839
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,120
authoritarianism

840
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,679
worldwide for a variety of complex

841
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:16,720
reasons but

842
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,440
no doubt about it um democracy is in

843
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,240
retreat

844
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,960
authoritarian practices are spreading um

845
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,039
you also have

846
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,159
this normalization

847
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,679
of offense in cyberspace so a lot of

848
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,159
nation states are jumping on this

849
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,200
bandwagon

850
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,480
developing cyber commands developing

851
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,919
techniques and methods

852
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,039
why well two reasons one defense is

853
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,279
expensive and very difficult

854
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,159
and meanwhile going on the offense is

855
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,120
very lucrative

856
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,519
it pays off and so we're seeing a kind

857
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,960
of normalization

858
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,360
of offensive doctrine and then naturally

859
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,519
what happens afterwards is you have

860
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,320
a whole private sector that sprouts up

861
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,279
to service

862
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,240
um these needs so everything ranging

863
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,360
from the high-end

864
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,320
private intelligence uh hack for all the

865
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,640
way down to that to the hack for hire

866
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,080
uh um services at the lower end

867
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,720
but what this means overall is a

868
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,000
shrinking space for global civil society

869
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,120
we are seeing targeted attacks uh

870
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,080
really i would even go so far as to say

871
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,200
neutralizing

872
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,440
the work of a lot of civil society

873
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,399
advocates

874
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,399
opposition groups journalists human

875
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,600
rights defenders

876
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,880
as um the technology that they depend on

877
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,919
becomes effectively their most uh

878
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,480
vulnerable point of exposure

879
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,880
and facing this rising uh threat

880
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,679
environment

881
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,799
this is a very very serious problem uh

882
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,559
for those of us who care about liberal

883
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,360
democracy globally

884
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,640
uh just a second here so um

885
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,760
i wanna also illustrate uh an important

886
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,799
dynamic

887
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,640
in this space uh what i would

888
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,799
characterize as a market failure

889
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,080
for civil society so looking um

890
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,039
at the universe of cases that we study

891
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:13,679
um

892
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,200
one finding sticks out and that is

893
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,480
the very same nation-state operators

894
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,960
who target industry and government that

895
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,000
we hear about in the

896
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,039
news and through industry reports

897
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,159
target civil society and they use

898
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,720
in many cases the very same techniques

899
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,279
methods

900
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,279
tradecraft espionage services and so on

901
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,840
the big difference here is that when it

902
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,679
comes to industry and government

903
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,240
however poor their network defenses may

904
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,720
be

905
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,840
in specific cases generally speaking

906
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,480
these are well-resourced organizations

907
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,679
they can go out

908
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,640
and pay the you know mandiants and fire

909
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,120
eyes

910
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,320
to come in uh investigate install

911
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,960
sophisticated equipment to defend their

912
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,120
their networks and monitor

913
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,159
24 hours and help them defend against

914
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,440
these type of threats

915
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,399
when it comes to civil society you know

916
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,560
typically speaking i'm generalizing here

917
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,480
but especially for civil society in the

918
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,520
global south

919
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,320
you're lucky to have a person who you

920
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,639
know

921
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,879
basically knows how to connect the

922
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,639
printer and has to deal with

923
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,320
you know um old operating systems that

924
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,359
are unlicensed

925
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,359
unpatched software they have no

926
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,359
resources no capability

927
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,760
so you have this huge market failure

928
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,599
around the most vulnerable part

929
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,639
of society and that's part of the reason

930
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,679
we're seeing

931
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,199
this this growing and alarming problem

932
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,719
as evidenced by ours and others research

933
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,599
what are the consequences well you have

934
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,399
low i.t

935
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,079
capacity lack of basic policies devices

936
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,480
network software often insecure lots of

937
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,040
misinformation you know people passing

938
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,079
folk wisdom back and forth lack of

939
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:04,960
systematic

940
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,040
uh um uh risk analysis

941
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,200
uh within the organizations because they

942
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,599
simply don't have the capacity to do it

943
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,079
and the attacks are really disrupting

944
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,079
the work the safety and trust

945
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,079
of these groups and again i want to

946
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,599
emphasize here

947
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,839
the evidence shows the same groups that

948
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,760
target industry and governments

949
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,839
are also targeting these type of

950
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:30,640
organizations

951
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,680
um there was a study done uh

952
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,240
earlier this year that was published led

953
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,720
by

954
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,760
a former citizen lab person now at eth

955
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,320
zurich

956
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,040
leonard maschmeyer uh what leonard did

957
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,800
to illustrate the point that i'm talking

958
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,440
about

959
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,560
was go through and and and analyze more

960
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,119
than

961
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,560
700 industry reports to see how they

962
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,599
characterize

963
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,560
uh the the threats to civil society how

964
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,160
they are represented

965
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,480
in their reports and what we found is

966
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,240
that the vast majority of industry

967
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,920
reports don't even bother

968
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,720
to mention civil society or if they do

969
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,040
they get merely a passing mention

970
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,000
and that's because obviously civil

971
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,880
society

972
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,240
are not very good prospective paying

973
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,280
clients those industry reports are

974
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,560
marketing tools they're meant to attract

975
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,640
clients and so for most of the industry

976
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,960
civil society is largely an afterthought

977
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,320
so what to do about this well one thing

978
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,599
i want to say is that there

979
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,960
is no one single approach that suffices

980
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,119
when people talk about mitigating some

981
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,960
of the harms that we're seeing in our

982
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,839
research

983
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,240
the first place we often go to is around

984
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,920
export controls

985
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,480
and here there's been some promising

986
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,599
developments

987
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,320
so in europe in particular there is a

988
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,920
very strong movement

989
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,400
to beefing up export controls around

990
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,640
this type of surveillance software i

991
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,760
would say that's

992
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,160
remarkable progress that's happening

993
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,880
there

994
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,400
but the big problem of course is that

995
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,480
many of the spyware companies are

996
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,920
located in countries

997
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,920
that won't be subject to this type of

998
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,040
regulation

999
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,680
for example nso group which is based in

1000
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,560
israel

1001
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,280
already goes through export controls

1002
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,480
every one of its

1003
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,720
uh exports of its surveillance

1004
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,440
technology has to be approved by the

1005
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,680
israeli ministry of defense

1006
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,440
so there's already an export control

1007
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,960
regime the problem is

1008
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,000
it's very permissive it doesn't

1009
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,480
limit what the company can should be

1010
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,119
doing

1011
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,599
to prevent the type of abuse of its

1012
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,079
technology that we see

1013
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,920
another area that's emerging that i

1014
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,839
think is also

1015
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,960
interesting and possibly very positive

1016
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,000
is around litigation so as a result

1017
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,800
of our research research by amnesty

1018
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,960
international and other groups

1019
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,200
many of the victims of this type of

1020
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,320
surveillance

1021
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,440
have gone to court they've either sued

1022
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,640
an so group or sued attempted to sue

1023
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,200
the countries that have targeted them

1024
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,839
whatsapp

1025
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,680
most famously has sued nso group and

1026
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,720
and the proceedings of that court case

1027
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,200
are

1028
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,560
underway ultimately i think this

1029
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,400
could help

1030
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,440
modify the behavior of the companies in

1031
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,359
so far as it begins to affect their

1032
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,400
bottom line

1033
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,960
so if their shareholders start to see

1034
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,800
fines coming in

1035
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,119
you know the legal the liabilities

1036
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:43,920
mounting

1037
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,320
they may put pressure on the companies

1038
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,040
to be

1039
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,240
better with respect to their human

1040
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,240
rights due diligence mechanisms which

1041
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,560
are

1042
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,960
almost entirely absent as it stands

1043
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,320
right now in spite of

1044
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,839
the lip service that some of them pay to

1045
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:00,400
it

1046
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,839
the last um area of mitigation i would

1047
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:04,800
point to

1048
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,400
is a bit more ambitious and

1049
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,119
also i would say long term but i think

1050
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,599
ultimately this is the most effective

1051
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,880
way i'd describe it would be a

1052
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,280
multi-pronged community approach

1053
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,000
to really rectify this problem we all

1054
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,280
need to work together

1055
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,200
and that's why i'm i'm very excited to

1056
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,240
speak to this community in particular

1057
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,880
over years many people have asked us

1058
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,400
what is the best model

1059
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,040
um should we you know create some kind

1060
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,960
of international organization that's

1061
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,160
going to deal with

1062
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,240
threats to civil society around the type

1063
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,760
of um

1064
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,240
un spyware that that you and others have

1065
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,680
discovered and together what we have

1066
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,240
learned is that the way to deal with

1067
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,680
this adequately

1068
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,480
is by this type of pragmatic

1069
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,920
multi-pronged community

1070
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,400
approach so obviously evidence-based

1071
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,520
research

1072
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,359
of the type that citizen lab does and

1073
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,200
what investigative journalists do

1074
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,480
and what groups like amnesty

1075
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,480
international does and even

1076
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,200
you know what the industries in their

1077
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,119
investigations can do to spotlight

1078
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,920
better civil society and remedy this gap

1079
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,079
that leonard maschmeyer myself and

1080
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,520
others identified

1081
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,920
is very important you want to bring the

1082
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,200
abuses to light

1083
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,040
but you don't want to end there we need

1084
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,760
to rectify the problem of most of civil

1085
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,280
society not having

1086
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,160
in-house technical capacity now in the

1087
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,160
past the way that that problem was dealt

1088
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,040
with is

1089
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,599
you know groups would parachute in for a

1090
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,440
week and give some kind of technical

1091
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,160
training

1092
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,040
and then they would leave and then those

1093
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,359
who

1094
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,880
receive the training would promptly

1095
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,640
forget about it and of course that

1096
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,680
doesn't work

1097
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,400
instead what we need to do is invest in

1098
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,520
local capacity

1099
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,160
identify people within the communities

1100
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,920
who can be trained up over

1101
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,040
years and develop a team

1102
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,160
so that they can receive indicators and

1103
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,839
know what to do with them

1104
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,319
in their local communities so that is an

1105
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,240
investment that has to happen

1106
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,359
from outside um and and mostly from

1107
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,720
philanthropic

1108
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,920
organizations foundations can help here

1109
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,119
industry can really help um one of the

1110
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,720
uh greatest things i've seen uh over the

1111
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,440
in recent years has been the type of

1112
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,599
collaboration we've been able to develop

1113
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,480
with some

1114
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,920
uh threat teams in um

1115
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,560
in alliance with the companies where

1116
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,400
they say okay we're going to

1117
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,800
we recognize this as a problem there's a

1118
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,480
gap here a market failure

1119
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,480
one way we can rectify it is by

1120
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,520
allocating a specific amount of time

1121
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
on our threats team to work on these

1122
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,119
problems either by

1123
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,920
spending you know a sabbatical at um

1124
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,400
citizen lab or other organizations

1125
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,319
and working with the civil society

1126
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,520
groups

1127
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,760
and i think that uh in the long term can

1128
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,280
be a very effective way to deal with

1129
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,240
this issue

1130
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,040
and then lastly is advocacy and legal

1131
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,760
support

1132
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,000
and again here most civil society

1133
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,160
targets who are facing this type of

1134
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,200
frankly unlawful surveillance can do

1135
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,800
something about it if they had

1136
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,839
legal support and um that of course is

1137
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,040
very expensive

1138
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,280
so we need to have law firms that are

1139
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,599
willing to recognize these problems

1140
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,200
and uh step in and help um remediate

1141
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,040
them by offering services

1142
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,400
to the civil society targets before i

1143
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,160
end i just want to say there's a piece

1144
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,000
of good news around all of this

1145
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,599
serge droz who you saw at the beginning

1146
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,319
the chair of first this year and leonard

1147
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,119
maschmeyer

1148
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,200
the person i i mentioned as well as

1149
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,359
others have started a special interest

1150
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:45,760
group

1151
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,599
at first precisely on this topic so

1152
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:50,240
that's why

1153
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,040
uh again to end my presentation here i

1154
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,079
just want to say

1155
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,359
this is a a really promising outcome

1156
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,680
and something that i hope will help

1157
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,800
remediate

1158
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,560
some of the problems that i've

1159
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,800
identified so i'll end there

1160
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,680
and thank you very much for patiently

1161
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,839
listening to me i'm happy to take

1162
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,839
questions

1163
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,160
thank you so much ron um i have a

1164
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,119
question

1165
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,839
here that came from from the audience so

1166
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,119
i'd like to

1167
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,880
read it to you um how can organizations

1168
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,160
best protect their key employees

1169
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,960
and leadership from this type of attacks

1170
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,280
by

1171
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,280
nso group or similar can mdm solutions

1172
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,760
provide mitigation to this type of

1173
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,920
threat

1174
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,160
well before i answer that question i

1175
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,280
will say that we

1176
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,000
at citizen lab we do not uh provide

1177
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,720
services

1178
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,119
we are not um our first

1179
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,160
mission is not to um uh

1180
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,920
look at the situation for the private

1181
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,599
sector or for governments because we

1182
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,240
assume

1183
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,400
that there are many capable uh

1184
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,240
businesses out there that provide those

1185
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:04,960
services

1186
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,319
and can uh help with um the type of

1187
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,839
threats that i describe

1188
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,079
when it comes to nso's spyware in

1189
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:12,880
particular

1190
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,280
and and other sorts of spyware like it

1191
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,240
you know this is

1192
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,800
first of all um technology that's

1193
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,839
designed

1194
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,079
to evade forensic detection that's

1195
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,280
designed to be

1196
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,160
very stealthy and the latest iteration

1197
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,680
that we've seen

1198
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,720
which is uh you know evolving to a

1199
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,480
no-click version of of the targeting

1200
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,280
is extremely concerning because it's

1201
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,079
very hard

1202
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,119
to defend against um we're seeing

1203
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,160
uh the companies learning how to exploit

1204
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,720
vulnerabilities in the in the basic

1205
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,880
protocols of the telecommunications

1206
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,560
infrastructure ss7

1207
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,960
weaknesses in the ss7 protocol for

1208
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,240
example

1209
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,119
one area where i think there could be a

1210
00:44:59,119 --> 00:44:59,920
response

1211
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,640
would be among the major platforms cloud

1212
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,400
providers and others

1213
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,720
if they spent time investigating these

1214
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,520
problems

1215
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,760
um and working in collaboration with

1216
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,880
groups like ours

1217
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,000
potentially we may we may

1218
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,800
be able to get better visibility into

1219
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,040
what companies like nso are doing

1220
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,920
to help build up uh defenses um i think

1221
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,680
whatsapp's response

1222
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,440
was a good example here so when they

1223
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,800
discovered that

1224
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,240
um series of no-click attacks

1225
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,079
on their platform in april may 2019

1226
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,040
they did two things one is um you know

1227
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,440
they

1228
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,680
worked with us and and we entered into

1229
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,560
an arrangement

1230
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,760
voluntarily where um we started

1231
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,839
investigating who the targets were so

1232
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:46,720
you know that's not an

1233
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,800
easy thing for a company like that to do

1234
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,720
especially a company like whatsapp which

1235
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,400
is sensitive about

1236
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,359
how they handle uh sharing of customer

1237
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:58,480
data

1238
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,079
but we got through that with the

1239
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,400
appropriate um you know kind of

1240
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,800
conversations and lawyers involved and

1241
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,319
agreements in place that

1242
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,960
that were comfortable to both sides um

1243
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,040
so that type of data sharing i think is

1244
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,880
is very important and of course they

1245
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,480
spoke out and

1246
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,760
went so far as to as to sue nso group

1247
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,520
which i think is noteworthy as well

1248
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,440
because um the platforms have a

1249
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,480
responsibility

1250
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,880
for the security of all of their users

1251
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,720
and they have a responsibility not to

1252
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,280
allow

1253
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,520
their infrastructure to be abused in

1254
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,480
this manner

1255
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,280
and so um i would i would point to that

1256
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,200
as an example of how

1257
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,920
we can hopefully over time mitigate some

1258
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,720
of the problems

1259
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,240
thank you uh i have another question

1260
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,720
here from general inventor ham

1261
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,760
uh what's the name of the news league

1262
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,800
and can you say what they are trying to

1263
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,359
do

1264
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,839
in what kind of capabilities oops i

1265
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,280
think i would need

1266
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,160
uh i think

1267
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:04,160
maybe it is yeah i think that jeremy's

1268
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:04,640
questions

1269
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,200
were not mentioned to you uh i will i

1270
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,440
will go to the next question so

1271
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,079
uh alexander yeager thanks ron for the

1272
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:12,560
talk

1273
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,640
besides uh maybe join this mentioned sig

1274
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,359
is there uh other kind that individuals

1275
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:19,920
listen

1276
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,359
right now could you do the one thing you

1277
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:24,480
always wanted

1278
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,200
uh to ask your responders to do so it's

1279
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,759
a comment

1280
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,119
okay um i see here one about

1281
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,599
i see a question here from sharif about

1282
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:36,960
export controls

1283
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,760
shall i take oh okay yeah you can go uh

1284
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,559
um

1285
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,520
i will just mark the other questions as

1286
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,760
uh respondent and now we will go back to

1287
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,960
another question from

1288
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,040
france uh so go ahead and start um

1289
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,880
so he asked about export controls

1290
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,359
hurting capacity building globally

1291
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,359
teaching cyber security and academia

1292
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,359
often rely on tools that may be

1293
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,520
included in such an export control

1294
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,520
approach this is a very good question

1295
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,839
because

1296
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:07,599
um many of us in this

1297
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,200
community had some serious concerns

1298
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,920
about um what was really one of the

1299
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,119
first attempts

1300
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,599
to coordinate export controls around

1301
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:18,400
spyware

1302
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,280
in the vasinar arrangement back in 2014

1303
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,160
i think it was

1304
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,359
2013 and the language

1305
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,000
and the approach in that initial attempt

1306
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,599
was very broad

1307
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,000
and we believed would actually

1308
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,119
potentially

1309
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,280
hinder some of the security research

1310
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,960
that even we at citizen lab were doing

1311
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,040
i think that export controls can be done

1312
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,480
more intelligently

1313
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,599
and more precisely to avoid that type of

1314
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,440
problem you can simply build in

1315
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,880
exceptions for public interest research

1316
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,720
or scientific research

1317
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,000
that would exempt the researchers

1318
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,800
from that type of control so it just has

1319
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,839
to be done

1320
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,520
intelligently

1321
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,760
okay thank you um a question from france

1322
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,200
latimer thank you lebron

1323
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,040
there are currently some initiatives

1324
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,720
like cyberpeace institute

1325
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,640
global commission and stability of

1326
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,760
cyberspace

1327
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,240
and many others are you cooperating and

1328
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,480
collaborating with them

1329
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,839
yes i'm actually on the advisory board

1330
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,119
for cyberpeace institute i've seen it

1331
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,960
from the very

1332
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,760
origins when it was first uh articulated

1333
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,640
and proposed

1334
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,200
right up to now where it's in very

1335
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,319
capable hands

1336
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:41,760
uh with with stefan dugan and his team

1337
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,880
and uh marice sake um

1338
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,280
you know these are people who understand

1339
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:47,920
the

1340
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,200
the um scope and scale of the problems

1341
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:51,839
that affect

1342
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,359
civil society and they are building

1343
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,119
uh a promising institution

1344
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,280
to help coordinate efforts to deal with

1345
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,400
it especially

1346
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,960
among the most uh at-risk groups

1347
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,160
worldwide so

1348
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,440
really trying to position themselves to

1349
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,000
remedy that market failure that i

1350
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,880
described

1351
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,680
so i'm quite excited that you know we've

1352
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,040
gone from a time where

1353
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,440
very little was happening five years ago

1354
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,240
to now

1355
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,520
things like cyber peace institute to um

1356
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,079
the special interest group at first that

1357
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:26,800
serge

1358
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,200
and leonard are helping to organize

1359
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,160
these are all

1360
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,359
important steps that we can take to help

1361
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,079
remedy the problems

1362
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,680
thank you ron a question from nicolas

1363
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,040
liu

1364
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,920
awesome presentation ron uh are they any

1365
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,480
sort of

1366
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,960
similar organizations to sydner to

1367
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,160
citizen lab

1368
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,280
that are out here with this involving

1369
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,000
threat

1370
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,040
what's a way forward to address

1371
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,880
the need for so many ngos that uh

1372
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,200
may need this support how can you make

1373
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,480
organizations like

1374
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,520
citizen lab scale that's an excellent

1375
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,040
question i spent a lot of time

1376
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,760
thinking about that because frankly

1377
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,280
within the university

1378
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,319
environment where citizen lab is based

1379
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,319
the type of work that we do is is really

1380
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:17,440
quite rare

1381
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,520
and to me that's that's always been a

1382
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,800
bit frustrating

1383
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,359
because the methods and tools that we

1384
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:24,640
rely on

1385
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,040
are not like some kind of secret sauce

1386
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,319
you know it's not like we have some

1387
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,520
magic we're just doing basic very

1388
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,280
careful evidence-based research using

1389
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,599
legal methods using open source

1390
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,200
intelligence methods

1391
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,280
using computer science engineering

1392
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,119
science methods

1393
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,200
there's no reason why there couldn't be

1394
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,680
a hundred citizen labs in universities

1395
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,640
the world over the biggest constraints

1396
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,400
really are around the risks

1397
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,640
of the research professional risks

1398
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,400
reputational risks

1399
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,839
risks from industry i have been sued

1400
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,520
the university of toronto has been

1401
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,119
threatened with lawsuits

1402
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,240
for the work that we do and

1403
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,400
there are no doubt many people who might

1404
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,400
otherwise be interested in this topic

1405
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,760
that don't want to go there because they

1406
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,000
see it as too risky

1407
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,200
for their professional reputation it's

1408
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,800
also a bit unorthodox

1409
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,200
so it's not very conventional especially

1410
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,319
from some of the

1411
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,000
you know computer science engineering

1412
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,359
science disciplines

1413
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,359
so i'm hoping that that will change i

1414
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:28,640
think it will change

1415
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,160
inevitably as as generational changes

1416
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,520
happen so new

1417
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,079
younger professors coming um i'm

1418
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,040
encouraged to see

1419
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,119
some of them talking about building

1420
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,480
things like this

1421
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,599
in in other universities um outside of

1422
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:44,640
universities

1423
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,640
um you know the threat intelligence

1424
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,079
companies do

1425
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,480
almost you know exactly what we do but

1426
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,280
for

1427
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,720
uh their corporate and government

1428
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,960
clients uh we would like to see that

1429
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,839
change

1430
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,000
to have them pay more attention to this

1431
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,440
area and

1432
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,599
i think that's starting to happen i'd

1433
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:02,960
like to see more of it

1434
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,200
and then you have within the ngo space

1435
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,839
we collaborate with amnesty

1436
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,680
international for example who has a tech

1437
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,400
lab

1438
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,000
um involving people who are

1439
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,119
former affiliates of citizen lab and uh

1440
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,960
to see them doing the type of work that

1441
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,359
they do is really encouraging for us

1442
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,119
because it means there's just not one

1443
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,640
group doing it when you have

1444
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,599
other groups you know um singing from

1445
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:30,160
the same

1446
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,640
course sheet so to speak uh pointing out

1447
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,680
that there is

1448
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,359
the same problems that they are

1449
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,960
identifying as we are

1450
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,040
this really helps reinforce the message

1451
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,559
and of course we can collaborate and

1452
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:41,520
share

1453
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,079
you know indicators and and share

1454
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,520
methods and so on

1455
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,319
um so that's very promising as well i i

1456
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:49,359
think you know in

1457
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,440
in the short term it's a bit frustrating

1458
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,960
but i hope over time

1459
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,040
that we'll see more of this happening

1460
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,800
especially within universities

1461
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,480
where you have the resources the

1462
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,720
capacity the independence

1463
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,920
to do this type of research

1464
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,319
thank you brown i have two more

1465
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:06,960
questions

1466
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,960
here and one is ron and kita

1467
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,680
uh how can nucleic infections be

1468
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,880
detected so that

1469
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,000
prior action is taken before an attack

1470
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
occurs

1471
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,520
that's a good question that i wouldn't

1472
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,760
have the ability to answer it'd be

1473
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,040
something that we'd want to

1474
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,319
send to my technical group to talk about

1475
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,119
um i i think you know what i can say is

1476
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,000
look this is

1477
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
uh really daunting to contemplate

1478
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,640
to think about um geez you know somebody

1479
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,119
could just

1480
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,160
ring up my phone and take it over

1481
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,160
and then once they are inside the device

1482
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,240
they can remove any evidence that the

1483
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,000
targeting even happened in the first

1484
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,880
place

1485
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,040
um and of course the the spyware is

1486
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,440
usually designed to be very stealthy

1487
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,319
to remove itself essentially

1488
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:57,440
self-destruct

1489
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,559
and evade even forensic detection makes

1490
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,720
it very very difficult

1491
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,200
i believe and again i would defer to the

1492
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,799
people who have greater technical

1493
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,880
knowledge than me on this topic

1494
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,920
but my view is that the visibility into

1495
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,599
this type of targeting

1496
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,880
um can come from the platforms from the

1497
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,440
large

1498
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,880
uh telcos in some cases from

1499
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,280
companies like whatsapp that that if

1500
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,400
they concentrate

1501
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,400
their resources on they may be able to

1502
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,440
identify this

1503
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,319
sort of targeting and alert victims to

1504
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:30,559
it

1505
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,799
but it is really like a nuclear option

1506
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,000
of spyware

1507
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,440
in terms of how you know this allows the

1508
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,119
companies and the operators

1509
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,520
to go dark in terms of the type of

1510
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,480
targeting that they're doing

1511
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,079
another questions here from cash uh

1512
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,079
wouldn't the right solution be in to

1513
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,720
include digital privacy as part of the

1514
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,079
human rights

1515
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,359
there are there always will be companies

1516
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,160
to provide

1517
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,359
tools and those misusing tools

1518
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,440
shouldn't be globally punishable to

1519
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,720
break privacy this way

1520
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,760
yes i you know in ideal terms sure that

1521
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,079
would be great uh the problem here is

1522
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,119
that you have

1523
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,720
a large and growing number of countries

1524
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,520
nation states that even if they sign on

1525
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,960
to such an agreement

1526
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,760
would routinely violate it in practice

1527
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,480
because

1528
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,280
the trend lines are in the opposite

1529
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,079
direction right

1530
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:32,559
now governments are developing

1531
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:33,760
capacities

1532
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,559
to maneuver in and through cyberspace to

1533
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:36,880
go

1534
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,160
on the offense and there are uh

1535
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,480
numerous companies that are supplying

1536
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,520
them with the

1537
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,680
tools the products and services to do

1538
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,760
that and so

1539
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,319
you know ultimately that's where we

1540
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,000
would like to see things go

1541
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,720
is that for there to be some kind of you

1542
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,240
know global agreement

1543
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,680
on norms and proper protections for

1544
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,960
privacy

1545
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,799
but as it stands now that's not the

1546
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,720
world we live in

1547
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,240
so until we get there we have to work on

1548
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,559
solving the immediate threats and that's

1549
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,559
why you know one has to be more

1550
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:13,599
pragmatic

1551
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,000
and look towards you know drawing in

1552
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,319
people who care about these problems

1553
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:21,119
in the short term from industry uh from

1554
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,640
the legal professions

1555
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,799
from academia um to to start mitigating

1556
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,760
um some of the most serious threats to

1557
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,440
civil society that are growing

1558
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,799
uh and i will come back to one of the

1559
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:38,160
questions uh

1560
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,760
here from and uh i think he came from

1561
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,480
alex

1562
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,520
uh our last question what do

1563
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,040
you run would uh ask us as i mean

1564
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,760
incident response community to do about

1565
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,440
it

1566
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,520
well i that's an excellent question

1567
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,640
thank you for that i

1568
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,640
i i would implore everybody who's part

1569
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,119
of the incident response community

1570
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:04,400
to think about to what degree um

1571
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,000
their their professional work is

1572
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,400
directed towards the most vulnerable

1573
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,839
populations

1574
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,680
in the world or within the countries

1575
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,960
that they live

1576
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,400
and think about ways that

1577
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,559
those vulnerable populations can get

1578
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,640
proper assistance and training

1579
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,359
not just a one-off not just parachuting

1580
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,000
in

1581
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,920
and you know telling them to use this

1582
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,160
tool or that tool and then leaving

1583
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,440
but long-term sustainable support

1584
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,920
for the most vulnerable populations

1585
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,040
because right now as i

1586
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,520
said in my presentation that type of

1587
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,760
support is sorely needed and it's

1588
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,559
missing

1589
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,119
and they simply don't have the capacity

1590
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:43,760
so

1591
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,520
you know within your communities if you

1592
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,760
could just think about what are the ways

1593
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,480
in which

1594
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,119
i could do this frankly this type of

1595
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,720
public service

1596
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,119
right this is this is not thinking about

1597
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,240
how to make money

1598
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,160
it's not thinking about how to build up

1599
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,599
a reputation

1600
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:02,720
it's it's it's an effort towards

1601
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,960
the collective well-being of the

1602
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,880
community of which you're a part

1603
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,920
and so anything that can be done to help

1604
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,160
mitigate some of these threats i think

1605
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,200
would be

1606
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,319
uh really appreciated and welcome

1607
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,040
and i i would direct you again to this

1608
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,200
new special interest group that serge

1609
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,200
and leonard are starting because what

1610
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,720
they want to do there is coordinate

1611
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,799
those efforts

1612
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:29,599
okay thank you so much in fact there is

1613
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:30,079
also

1614
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,960
a presentation that is part of this of

1615
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,799
the

1616
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:36,960
program today that is about the civil

1617
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,040
search yes it's basically

1618
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,160
exactly about about days how i think

1619
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,200
people should follow that and see what

1620
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,480
guys are bringing the community in terms

1621
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,920
of instant response

1622
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,200
and related to the human rights

1623
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,880
