identify and stop attacks

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,959
uh well sure i um in in thinking

61
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,440
about this uh prior to our session the

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,280
one thought that first came to my mind

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,080
was

64
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,040
back when not patio was first released

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,680
uh

66
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,640
we have some participants um and some

67
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,840
allied partners

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,640
in europe and they had tipped us off to

69
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,000
petya before

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,080
it really started to hit the us and we

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,599
felt like we were able to

72
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,640
um communicate to our community on an

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,680
early side

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,200
that that was coming and i think that

75
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,280
was was valuable it was one of the first

76
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,640
things that came to my mind thinking

77
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,119
about this

78
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,519
yeah thank you jim so can you explain

79
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,120
real quick um i should

80
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,879
ask you to do this before we start

81
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,319
kicked off real quickly

82
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,840
who's your membership so what is the

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,920

88
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,200
ice tech

89
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,319
um our membership uh comprised

90
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,599
of uh natural gas distribution companies

91
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,120
so they'll be natural gas utility

92
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,800
companies in the united states and in

93
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,599
canada

94
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,760
and also natural gas pipelines in the

95
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,360
united states and canada so that's the

96
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,760
universe of our membership

97
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,040
great thank you sir uh jeff um

98
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,280

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,599
your isac and

102
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,879
great so uh thanks uh the aviation ice

103
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,159
ac is a global

104
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,560
nonprofit so we have members on five

105
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,000
different continents

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,720
and they make up uh all the different

107
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,640
industrial segments that are part of the

108
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
aviation ecosystem so we have

109
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,360
air framers we have the suppliers that

110
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,040
build equipment that goes into an

111
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,159
airplane

112
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,120
we have airlines airports satellite

113
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
providers

114
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,920
we have air navigation service providers

115
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,640
and

116
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,959
other service companies that support the

117
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,840
aviation industry

118
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,798
um thinking of the uh of an example here

119
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,040
of

120
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
of where uh the members have really

121
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,560
helped the the members

122
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,759
we had uh an incident where um a nation

123
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,479
state

124
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,240
was trying to get into an airline's

125
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,120
networks and actually penetrated it uh

126
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,560
probably one of the most interesting

127
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,479
things that we learned from that was the

128
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,160
reason that they were there was to

129
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,120
actually

130
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,240
use the airline's systems uh to be able

131
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,960
to track

132
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,240
individuals so that's a you know

133
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,919
much different motivation than you see

134
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,040
when someone's trying to steal

135
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,880
intellectual property for example

136
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,840
or try and do a ransomware event

137
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,600
something along those lines

138
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,320
so when that event happened the member

139
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,720
uh

140
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,680
shared that they were working on the

141
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,120
incident response

142
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,600
and another member company uh was

143
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,000
familiar with that group that was in

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,039
their network

145
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,240
uh because of an event that they had so

146
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,000
we were able to hook two of our members

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,440
up who um

148
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,039
we had one you know going through an

149
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,720
incident response and one who was

150
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,759
already experienced

151
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,520
dealing with that uh particular

152
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,120
adversary and so

153
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,800
they actually collaborated to the point

154
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,960
where um and these these companies are

155
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,560
competitors typically

156
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,960
but they were complete uh collaborating

157
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,120
in terms of the cyber security teams

158
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,199
uh they actually flew one of the cyber

159
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,039
security analysts over to the other

160
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,080
uh company's uh headquarters to be able

161
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,280
to work with their team

162
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,720
and uh completed the incident response

163
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,039
and then afterwards uh the company that

164
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,560
suffered that attack

165
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,639
actually did a presentation to the

166
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,800
entire isac

167
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,720
and they went through their root cause

168
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,960
analysis and that actually led to

169
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,280
several of the members

170
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,400
re-prioritizing their projects with

171
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,680
active directory

172
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,000
uh because they had learned uh how

173
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,080
active directory had been compromised as

174
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,400
a part of that attack and it led to

175
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,639
again a lot of great work being done and

176
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,720
reprioritized to prevent that group from

177
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,400
being able to have the same impact at

178
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,120
another member

179
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,120
yeah so that's really interesting jeff

180
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
thank you so they were after

181
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,400
they were on the network looking for

182
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,479
information about a specific traveler

183
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,080
or a set of travelers which is really

184
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,600
interesting yes

185
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,680
yep that's interesting so um

186
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,080
the itis act the information technology

187
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
information sharing and analysis center

188
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,120
we're similar to jeff's and

189
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
jim's organizations in the sense that

190
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,520
we're a non-profit organization

191
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,479
we also accept our members from the

192
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,000
united states and outside

193
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,919
of the companies outside of the united

194
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,160
states as well

195
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
most many of our companies most of them

196
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,840
are the traditional

197
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,160
information technology companies but

198
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,919
we've also

199
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,240
include companies who leverage

200
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,080
information technology for core business

201
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,880
processes

202
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,680
such as fooding agriculture companies

203
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,720
as one example we have several fruiting

204
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,240
agriculture companies who are members of

205
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,599
our board as well

206
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,000
so the one of the examples i was

207
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,319
prepared to talk about today was

208
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,280
um something uh one of our larger member

209
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,240
companies said there's

210
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,440
a little bit of a misperception i think

211
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,599
that only small companies can benefit

212
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,840
from information sharing organizations

213
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,440
because larger companies have a lot of

214
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,199
the capab have

215
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,160
more mature robust capabilities but one

216
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,759
of the examples um

217
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,000
that i was going to be sharing today

218
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,120
talked about a

219
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,440
a one of our larger member companies uh

220
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,160
came across

221
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,759
a suspicious ip a geo located outside of

222
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,120
the united states that they

223
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
weren't really sure what it was right

224
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,319
it's one of those

225
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,039
instances where an analyst had a you

226
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,039
know this doesn't look right moments

227
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,000
so they looked at this ip did some

228
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,680
research on it themselves couldn't find

229
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,639
much on it

230
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,560
couldn't find anything on it so they

231
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,639
sent it off to us and asked us

232
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,080
hey can you um can you do some research

233
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,280
on this for us so we leveraged the other

234
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,000
members

235
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
that we have along with other partners

236
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,280
and we were able

237
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,400
to link this ip address to a

238
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,599
dhs report from

239
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,840
related to heartbleed right so um

240
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,080
we were then able to confirm that the ip

241
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,839
address that was shared with us was

242
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,320
malicious and was related to the

243
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,919
heartbleed expert

244
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,080
so in that instance we had a member

245
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,440
company who was just

246
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,640
not sure what his ip was felt this

247
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,519
wasn't it wasn't right and it um you

248
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:47,839
know

249
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,080
didn't look right and lo and behold it

250
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,120
finds finds out that it's uh it's uh

251
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,279
there's a heart breed expert so they

252
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,880
were associated with the heartbreak

253
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,600
expert

254
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,519
so they were now then able to identify

255
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,720
with his rights

256
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,320
you know they got more information about

257
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
heartbleed and were able to

258
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,279
uh lock down uh lock down their network

259
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,000
so

260
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,160
um i think those are you know some

261
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,440
pretty good examples

262
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,200
that we've talked about about how the

263
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,640
collaboration

264
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,040
um it's a it's a it's a real thing and

265
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,640
it adds real value

266
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,760
so um jim let's go back to you real

267
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,160
quick

268
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,120
you know is this run-off information

269
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,080
sharing

270
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,760
is or is this you know everywhere i

271
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,680
think it's easy to come up with an

272
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,399
example

273
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,640
or but is this something that happens um

274
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,240
sharing within your organization on

275
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,680
operational issues

276
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,279
is this a routine occurrence where

277
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,839
organizations were sharing and how else

278
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:44,480
do

279
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,360
how do members share

280
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,760
that's a good question scott and uh to

281
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,560
be honest with you

282
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,240
we're we're one of the newer isex we've

283
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,839
been around for six years

284
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,279
and what i've seen is uh most commonly

285
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,880
the folks that share the ones that feel

286
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,640
comfortable sharing with the work with

287
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,200
the uh

288
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,440
the community and the ones that have

289
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,200
participated the longest

290
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,640
have the greatest comfort level in

291
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,320
sharing um

292
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,600
and i think that other i've heard that

293
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,480
from other uh isaac's as well

294
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,920
uh in our case i would say that

295
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,200
uh the participant sharing is far less

296
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,839
than broader sharing like sharing from

297
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,240
government or analyst reports

298
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,920
but it does it does happen it's

299
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,760
something we've got to encourage on a

300
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,399
regular basis

301
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,399
yeah thank you so how do you get your

302
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,600
members to share do you

303
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,839
do you have a platform do you do you

304
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,279
have phone calls

305
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,440
how do you build a comfort level for to

306
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,360
get members to share

307
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,760
uh that's also a great question so we do

308
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,160
have a thread intel platform that's

309
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,519
uh secured that people share with and

310
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,640
uh that that's how they they post and

311
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,000
they get their information

312
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,079
the platform also has a a mobile

313
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,920
application that they can use

314
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,880
uh to both receive and post information

315
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
which is used very heavily

316
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,839
by participants um the

317
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,000
uh and these are both these are all

318
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,760
secure platforms

319
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,760
uh our community uh

320
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,959
meets through trade association uh work

321
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,800
that's done on an annual basis

322
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,519
and uh and many of the participants have

323
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,880
very close ties

324
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,279
through that so that's what encourages

325
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,120
them to share

326
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,480
but there's there's some that are sort

327
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,320
of outliers that aren't as uh

328
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,519
as comfortable sharing and um

329
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,839
the the the phone meetings and the

330
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,880
in-person meetings

331
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,079
is really what fosters the sharing sure

332
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,000
thank you sir and uh jeff i guess the

333
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,320
same set of questions to you

334
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,079
and you know one one thing about the

335
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,519
aviation industry

336
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,920
is obviously there's a lot of safety

337
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,079
regulations that companies need to

338
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,120
need to uh comply with so we're being in

339
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,760
a regulated

340
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,519
industry how does that impact the

341
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,560
sharing among the members

342
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,560
uh good good question so we have uh

343
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,320
several different communities that we

344
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,480
have uh in order to

345
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
kind of make the sharing as effective as

346
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,920
possible so

347
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,600
uh similar to what jim mentioned with

348
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,519
respect to a portal

349
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,279
uh you know we have bi-weekly telephone

350
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,959
calls for example where people have

351
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,800
conversations

352
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,279
um we have uh the ability to request

353
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,000
information

354
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,720
from other members so instead of just

355
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,399
contributing intelligence information

356
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,839
you may actually be

357
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,920
eliciting a best practice when you're

358
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,600
dealing with a project or something that

359
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,000
you're trying to get some help on

360
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,519
so as i said we have these different

361
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,639
communities so we have a threat

362
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,160
intelligence community

363
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,560
and then it has uh some working groups

364
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,920
to help companies

365
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,560
uh to be able to get more specific

366
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,079
conversations about the issue they're

367
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:48,800
addressing

368
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
a threat actors a fraud working group

369
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,560
something along those lines

370
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
we also have working groups for network

371
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,920
security architects

372
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,720
and for product security specialists and

373
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,200
for

374
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,720
compliance folks and so when it comes to

375
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,959
issues particularly like compliance it's

376
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,000
really become

377
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,639
a driver for cyber security across our

378
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,160
industry anyway

379
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,639
we have pii because you have passenger

380
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,160
information for example we have

381
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,680
lots of people getting credit card

382
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,839
information um etc

383
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,240
so when all of that uh uh

384
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,639
new laws come out that have to be

385
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,320
complied with and you see a lot of that

386
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,480
going on in europe right now so the gdpr

387
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,560
i'm sure people are familiar with that

388
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,440
but they're also actually creating

389
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,800
requirements that you have an

390
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,959
information security management system

391
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,399
if you're a company related to the

392
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
aviation industry in europe

393
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,959
so typically you see compliance rules

394
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,800
get started in one part of the world and

395
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,519
then they

396
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,720
flow across the rest of the world so

397
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,320
each of these different working groups

398
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,160
is really the way that

399
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,199
we get a lot of information um shared

400
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:55,839
with more

401
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,800
folks who are all supporting the entire

402
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,519
cso

403
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,040
role at their companies i think

404
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,880
another thing that's really important is

405
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,399
uh

406
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,240
except for kovid right we typically get

407
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,959
together four times a year in person

408
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,360
um there's a question i can see in in

409
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,399
the chat there about you know trust

410
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,800
and to us the biggest part of building

411
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,560
that trust is to actually get people

412
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,519
together

413
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,959
uh to share um you know a beer

414
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,680
after a meeting so you can you know get

415
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,639
to know people

416
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,880
uh better because the more those

417
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
relationships happen where people really

418
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,839
know each other

419
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,839
the more comfortable they're going to be

420
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,920
sharing information to

421
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,519
help each other out you know in these

422
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,160
different uh these different types of

423
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,839
responses that we have

424
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,880
yeah so thanks for that um jeff you know

425
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,720
um appreciate the reminder to you about

426
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
the questions if you do have a question

427
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,519
please

428
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,399
submit them in into the uh through the q

429
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:00,720
q

430
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,160
a function so um you know i'll just save

431
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,959
real quickly

432
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,040
for the iti sac um

433
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,560
the trust issue is you know is a big run

434
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,160
right or we

435
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,639
we um we have a lot of competitors who

436
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,440
are who are

437
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,959
competing in the market in the market

438
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,880
space but what we've

439
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,279
done i think is we've broken broken up a

440
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,120
big membership in smaller chunks so

441
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,639
we're trying to get companies together

442
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,959
around communities of interest

443
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,240
get them to to discuss um you know areas

444
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,440
that they have in common

445
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,720
uh but also we've been working there for

446
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,839
several years now we're making the

447
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,440
business case as to why it's important

448
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,240
to share how

449
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,639
sharing adds value to your organization

450
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,680
talking about

451
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,920
when you contribute the information you

452
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,839
get back and how it helps

453
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,560
and how it helps secure your enterprise

454
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,040
and

455
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,160
how participating in a collaborative

456
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
information sharing organizations

457
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,000
really is a sound risk management

458
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,720
activity and a force multiplier to

459
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,959
a organization's internal security teams

460
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,079
nobody has

461
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,959
the budget especially these days to hire

462
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,120
all of the security analysts they want

463
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,360
nobody has the the money to get all of

464
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,120
the security tools that

465
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,120
that they want um so you know

466
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,880
for a uh engaging in a membership

467
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,320
organization information sharing

468
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,079
organization that gives you

469
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,560
access to analysts from pure companies

470
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,000
who are dealing with the same problems

471
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,040
that you have and

472
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,240
maybe have already gotten found

473
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,920
solutions to problems you're you're

474
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,040
dealing with

475
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,360
so one of the things in addition to the

476
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
indicator sharing and the

477
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,560
using the platforms that that jim jeff

478
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,240
i have spoken about i also want to

479
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
make sure we don't lose track of the um

480
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,240
collaboration

481
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,440
and the the the analyst analyst

482
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
peer-to-peer exchange that goes on

483
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,160
through

484
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,399
uh it used to be when i started with the

485
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,600
iti sac i guess

486
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,839
about 15 years and 15 years ago now

487
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,000
was a slow um drip of information coming

488
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,720
in

489
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,839
um i and now

490
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,919
where we have this opposite problem or

491
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,199
there's

492
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,199
we can share indicators at scale now

493
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,480
where there's there's

494
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,720
you know the the the the problem isn't a

495
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,039
shortage of indicators the problem is a

496
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,679
uh making sense of what's coming in so

497
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,480
engaging

498
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,400
in an information sharing organization

499
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,600
can help you do that

500
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,760
so we have um some questions coming up

501
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,640
here in

502
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,880
in the chat so are we generally know

503
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,799
that search c-series are established

504
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,400
following one or more major incidents

505
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,760
how are your ice axe

506
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,039
started so um

507
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,559
jim or maybe we'll go to you for that

508
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,840
you did mention that you're one of the

509
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,039
newer isac so

510
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,919
what was the impetus for your icesac

511
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,240
coming together

512
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,559
um well that's a good question the the

513
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,760
oil and natural gas

514
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,400
sub sector of the energy sector saw a

515
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,360
need for

516
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,840
information sharing prior to the isac

517
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,960
and i worked for the american gas

518
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,880
association as

519
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,640
my main job this is part of my job there

520
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,080
uh we were sending out email alerts to

521
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,120
folks on timely issues

522
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,559
and they were realizing that they

523
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,000
weren't getting the right people they

524
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,120
weren't getting through

525
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,080
et cetera so that was really the impetus

526
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,400
for

527
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,080
developing the isac specifically there's

528
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,919
actually two ice sacks developed

529
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,480
um there's also an oil isac which is

530
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,679
geared predominantly towards the

531
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,039
petroleum industry

532
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,400
um uh so we we have those two pieces

533
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,440
that we cover

534
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,840
and that's where it started from

535
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,880
thank you for that uh jeff aviation

536
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,360
so the aviation i sat grew out of a

537
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,320
working group

538
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,880
actually the working group had been

539
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,000
getting together a very

540
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,160
small number of members in the community

541
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,559
i think about seven or eight uh

542
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,600
member companies that are now founding

543
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,000
members of the aviation isaac

544
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,600
they really felt that such a small group

545
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,440
although it was effective for that that

546
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,160
small group

547
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,200
uh needed broader input and really a

548
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,880
better view of the entire threat

549
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,799
landscape across the industry

550
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,919
so that drove us to um you know expand

551
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,600
that working group out into

552
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,160
into an isac and you know make this more

553
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,559
formal with a platform and

554
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,760
get more more input

555
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,919
super and for the itis act we were

556
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,760
formed in 2000

557
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,000
or shortly after the pdd 63 in

558
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,400
1998 uh that called for

559
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
the establishment of sector specific

560
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,160
information sharing organizations

561
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,480
um so we were

562
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,440
formed almost immediately after that so

563
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,480
um

564
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,679
our impetus was showing in this

565
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,840
voluntary industry collaboration and

566
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,120
coordination

567
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,320
um you know in after the light of

568
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,480
the march commission report and then pdd

569
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,120
63 and president clinton

570
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,000
um so we have a couple more questions in

571
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,679
the in the in the queue here so let's go

572
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,320
through those

573
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,000
um would you guys be willing to share

574
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,320
more about exact platforms you're

575
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,679
using um or so

576
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,799
within the iti sac we're using

577
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,280
uh truestar intelligence management

578
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,240
platform

579
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,880
uh we've been using that for our

580
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,960
automated indicator sharing so we every

581
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,240
indicator we get

582
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,360
goes into that platform and uh we can

583
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,039
build reports in the platform that we

584
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,559
can share to members and members have

585
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,480
the ability to

586
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,480
use sticksaxy api to um

587
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,919
to um to pull that information out

588
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,280
so um jeff would you like to tackle that

589
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,039
one

590
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,080
yep so we use uh the sultra

591
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,039
uh tool for automated indicator exchange

592
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,280
but i would like to highlight that

593
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,880
automated indicator exchange is not

594
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,000
something that uh a lot of our members

595
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,760
anyway are really excited about

596
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,360
i mean they like to have the

597
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,280
functionality but

598
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,640
as we look at it it's not used too much

599
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,799
there's a lot of noise in automated

600
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:21,919
indicator sharing

601
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,559
and so uh companies are trying to find a

602
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,919
real balance between

603
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,159
using that capability and not um really

604
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,919
flooding the screens of their detect

605
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,039
analysts with uh

606
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,080
bad intel so i think there is still a

607
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,880
lot of work

608
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,840
to be done in terms of uh figuring out

609
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,000
how automated indicator sharing works

610
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,720
best

611
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,960
uh but they said we use sultra now and

612
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,400
we're actually in the process

613
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,000
of looking at uh misp and

614
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,039
either making both available to our to

615
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,720
our members or

616
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,600
adopting one but right now misp is

617
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,720
something that we're taking a look at

618
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,120
it's very popular over in europe

619
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,320
yeah and i think that's a great point

620
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,400
jeff that the automated automated

621
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,760
sharing is not for everyone

622
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,799
and i must you know you do

623
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,640
if you can't handle the amount of

624
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,240
indicators you can get quickly

625
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,240
overwhelmed with indicator overload

626
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,200
um and especially if you're a small

627
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,640
small company who

628
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,200
doesn't have the technology platforms to

629
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,400
ingest or even

630
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,440
um you know if you don't have a the

631
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,159
capability

632
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,799
to receive um or pull indicators and

633
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,440
it's not

634
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,799
much used to hear either right so um jim

635
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,760
are you uh able to talk about what you

636
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,000
use

637
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,840
uh yeah we we use the sciwer platform um

638
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,760
which we've used for the last year it

639
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,840
replaced a custom developed platform

640
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,240
which was not very user friendly

641
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,559
and we saw very little participation in

642
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,320
the last year our participation has

643
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,039
jumped

644
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,039
several hundred percent just because

645
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,080
people are participating

646
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,159
they weren't participating at all before

647
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,960
um so that that's helped a lot

648
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,400
and we found that that platform has

649
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,120
worked quite well for us

650
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,360
sure thank you so i think this next

651
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,200
question gets to where we were talking

652
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,679
about

653
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,720
um earlier about our different maturity

654
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,600
levels so

655
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,679
we we're all members of the national

656
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,360
council of ice acts which has

657
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,799
24 or so member organizations

658
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,240
um so we were the question here is

659
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,720
what is um the gaps in maturity among

660
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,080
ice axe

661
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,440
um and marks my view on this

662
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,640
i've been with the national council of

663
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,559
vice acts i think the longest

664
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,720
is that we seem to make her work right

665
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,799
so no isaac is the same

666
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,440
we all have different um levels of

667
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,039
capability and our members have

668
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,720
different levels of capability but we're

669
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,840
all designed

670
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,919
to meet the needs of our members so

671
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,679
within the national council of ice acts

672
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,279
i think what we try to do is

673
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,000
we focus on providing analytic reports

674
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,679
across the membership

675
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,679
and requests for information so that

676
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:58,720
we're not drowning

677
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,880
each other in indicators and we're

678
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,400
providing summaries of what

679
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,039
we feel is important and then those are

680
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,320
able to be consumed

681
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,440
by by you know all of our member

682
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,799
memorized acts so um unless jim or

683
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,880
jeff you have anything to add we're we

684
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,400
are short on time and we have two more

685
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,320
questions so i'll promise to see if

686
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,760
either of you have anything else to add

687
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,840
there

688
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,240
okay

689
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,520
okay so um many countries have sector

690
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,000
level c

691
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
search are ice x complementary how do

692
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,760
you work together with your

693
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,799
with your respective sector sea sorts

694
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,639
so who wants to tackle this

695
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,600
sure so c-series our computer security

696
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,200
incident response team

697
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,960
is um what i go by right

698
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,640
uh so in the united states uh there are

699
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,400
uh government you know the united states

700
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,919
government set up

701
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,400
the 16 critical infrastructure sectors

702
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,480
now it's up to 17.

703
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,720
and so the government has their agency

704
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,919
so you'll find the department of

705
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,440
homeland security has

706
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,799
cisa now and the aviation isac along

707
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,400
with a couple of other isacs

708
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,640
actually have people who go to work each

709
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,840
day

710
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,120
to cisa central which is uh the

711
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,240
former and kik and they basically

712
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,919
represent the sector there so that they

713
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,279
can provide information and get

714
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,000
information

715
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
for the sector so several sectors work

716
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,279
along those lines

717
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,200
uh some people don't some sectors don't

718
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,960
have anybody going there every single

719
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,240
day but they have them

720
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,480
you know reporting in in order to keep

721
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,080
that that contact

722
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,120
uh over in europe there is uh

723
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,200
kind of a renewed initiative right now

724
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,120
to start to create ice axe

725
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,360
and so there's a lot of work being done

726
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,240
um in the european union

727
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,720
as they investigate exactly how ice acts

728
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,960
work and try to find

729
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,000
ways to overcome some real challenges

730
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,360
in the european union when it comes to

731
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,200
information sharing because there's 24

732
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,320
countries in there

733
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,200
and it's uh very difficult in order for

734
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,559
them to

735
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,600
get documents approved that meet the

736
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,039
information sharing

737
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,559
uh requirements of all the different

738
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,960
members

739
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,799
super um excellent um

740
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,760
jim anything to add on that sir

741
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,000
access to that is requires security

742
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,360
clearances which um

743
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,440
are sometimes not the easiest to get in

744
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,640
the united states

745
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,480
um but we've had some trouble with

746
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,919
security clearances with our

747
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,039
isac but we we participate very closely

748
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,559
not so much at that level but

749
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,440
our sector specific agency which is a

750
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,559
us-based term

751
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,240
would be the department of energy then

752
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,320
they convene a monthly

753
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,080
uh call for

754
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,240
analysts within the three uh energy

755
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,320
high sacs the electric guy sac risetech

756
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,840
and the oil ice sac

757
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,600
and that's a great opportunity to hear

758
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,200
presentations from them on what's

759
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,640
current and also

760
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,080
for us to share what we're seeing and

761
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,760
dialogue about that and that's been very

762
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,740
productive

763
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,640
[Music]

764
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,200
great thank you and then um in the final

765
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,960
minute or so that we have i think we can

766
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
get to this last question

767
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,080
which is how do i sex use face-to-face

768
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,039
meetings right

769
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,120
how do they work given that there are

770
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,039
hundreds or thousands of uh

771
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,000
people participating in these

772
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,720
organizations

773
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,440
so um

774
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,679
we have not had an isac meeting um

775
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,880
uh since inception but as i mentioned uh

776
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,159
the uh the organizations that that feed

777
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,039
into the isa

778
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,640
the american guest association the

779
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,480
canadian gas association

780
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,840
and the international um

781
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
gas association of america those those

782
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,240
would be uh

783
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,640
the three organizations to feed into us

784
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,279
they do

785
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,039
meet and when they meet there's

786
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,600
typically a dng isek report

787
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,240
and people do chat with one another that

788
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,919
that's the context for people to be in

789
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,520
person with one another

790
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,159
so far that's at least our experience

791
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,840
which may be different from other eye

792
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,399
sex super

793
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,039
uh jeff you guys um how do you guys

794
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,720
handle this

795
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,559
first of all i would love to have this

796
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,240
problem with uh

797
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,760
hundreds and thousands of member

798
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,600
organizations we don't

799
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,520
uh we don't have that many people that

800
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,520
that are members i mean we have

801
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,080
several hundred um analysts but in terms

802
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,760
of member companies you know we don't

803
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,120
we're not into the

804
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,159
hundreds and hundreds um i i think

805
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,919
you know as i mentioned the fact that we

806
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,039
have created uh working groups

807
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,000
and par star communities so that the

808
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,520
people who are specializing in

809
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,679
particular issues can find

810
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,320
those folks who are uh working those

811
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,840
same problems makes it

812
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,000
a lot more effective as a as an

813
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,200
association

814
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,039
and so if you're a network security

815
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,039
architect for example you can just

816
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,480
engage with the network security

817
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,159
architecture working group

818
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,320
uh what we do in that working group

819
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,200
though uh

820
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,600
is we bring in the intelligence analysts

821
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,679
every so many meetings and

822
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,000
they'll do an intelligence briefing uh

823
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,840
so that group can be up to speed on

824
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,760
what's happening with the intelligence

825
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,520
and not necessarily have to try and

826
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,120
follow the intelligence

827
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,919
um streams every single day so trying to

828
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,679
find ways you know where we can matrix

829
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,039
the different skill sets

830
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,159
and then just make sure that you're

831
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,240
spending most of your time in in the

832
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,919
area that's most interest to you seems

833
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,279
to work well

834
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,520
and then to our close out by saying that

835
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,720
there are there are ice acts that do old

836
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
interim meetings in person interim

837
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,480
meetings uh and they turn them into

838
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,840
conferences as well

839
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,039
where they invite members and

840
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,080
non-members and then they have

841
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,919
member-only sessions and

842
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,919
um you know they make uh you know they

843
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,640
have lots of people show up to those

844
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,120
um and which is uh yeah which is a good

845
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,159
benefit for them

846
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,200
so there are ways to turn these um you

847
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,000
know

848
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,679
these build trusts through these annual

849
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,000
meetings or smaller breakout sessions

850
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,600
