the lines effectively

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,520
breaking out a bigger box of of crayons

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,560
to expand

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,399
the context around threat information

45
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,520
sharing

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,880
with that i'll hand it over to you

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,839

so thank you mike for the introduction

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,320
uh

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,280
i am trey harley uh joining me is

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,920
android

52
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,360
cloudy uh i have known him long enough

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,840
that i feel comfortable to butcher his

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,479
name

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,800
so welcome everyone uh the goal of

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
today's session is to talk a little bit

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,480
about information sharing in general

58
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,800
and to highlight how threat information

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,400
may come in different shapes and sizes

60
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,200
so that means

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
anything from those simple indicator

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,720
lists that we see all too often more

63
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,800
often than we wish

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,200
up to those well-formed contextualized

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,959
graphs of information

66
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,400
and what you want to do is we want to

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,640
basically talk about how to get from one

68
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,440
to the other

69
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,680
so how to convert our indicator lists

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,200
when we're producing data

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,000
into that ritual from data set and why

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,080
you should care about doing that

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,560
so we're going to look at some different

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,680
profiles

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,440
of user profiles that are typically

76
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,959
consuming the information that we

77
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,959
produce and highlight how that would

78
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,319
affect them we're also going to give you

79
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,760
some practical pointers on how to

80
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,239
basically

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,680
what sort of questions you should be

82
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,959
asking yourself when you're creating the

83
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,040
data in order to get to this more

84
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,400
rich data set

85
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,000
so common user profiles um

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,319
i'm not going to read this slide at you

87
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,800
but i'm sure that you recognize

88
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,200
a number of these roles they exist

89
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,400
within

90
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,560
probably each and every one of your

91
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,840
organizations

92
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,080
maybe not all or at least some and it's

93
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,200
important to note here

94
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,560
that when it comes to cyber threat

95
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,000
intelligence sharing um

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,280
these different types of

97
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,000
folks they're tr they're trying to solve

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,480
different problems

99
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,400
from the same data set so how can we

100
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,840
make their lives simpler

101
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,720
so first of all before we go into the

102
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,519
into depths of of how to do exactly that

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,959
let's talk a little bit about the two

104
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,480
main roles that we can play in the

105
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,480
information exchange so one of them is

106
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,040
us being consumers and whenever we're in

107
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,480
that role we basically have to

108
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,640
consider how can we make our information

109
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,760
first of all consumable

110
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,680
by everyone so that means the basics

111
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,360
getting formats and so on right

112
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,840
but also useful to them and this is uh

113
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,280
going to be the linchpin of the entire

114
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,239
talk basically

115
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,040
where we look at the different aspects

116
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,478
of how to make this information actually

117
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,478
more useful by contextualizing it so

118
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,000
that it makes sense to the recipients of

119
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,360
the data

120
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,600
now most of the time when we're on the

121
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,199
receiving end of the data

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,600
that means that uh that we don't have

123
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,320
all this

124
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,960
power to basically ensure that data is

125
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,560
contextualized from the get go there are

126
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,759
some exceptions

127
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,280
it might be that you have influence over

128
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,720
whoever is producing the data for you

129
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,919
for example if it's a different team

130
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,360
within your organization if it's a

131
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,800
vendor that you're paying money to and

132
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,560
so on so in that case by all means use

133
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,240
that power that you have

134
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,000
but in receiving side the situation

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,440
still isn't hopeless

136
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,720
if the data is at least somewhat

137
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
contextualized you can use that context

138
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,560
to better filter out the data for your

139
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,080
different tools for your different

140
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,120
processes and to extract knowledge from

141
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,080
the data

142
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,240
itself so let's see how we can

143
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,680
basically get to these points where we

144
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,479
get this knowledge out of data uh

145
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,520
who hasn't received this type of thing i

146
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,120
i first saw a list

147
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,880
very similar to this back in the late

148
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,240
90s

149
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,440
um what even is this

150
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,720
it might be useful it might be not

151
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,199
uh it lacks context

152
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,720
so before we go into

153
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,320
into bashing that type of information

154
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,680
sharing there is one thing to get out of

155
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,560
the way

156
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,960
there are some cases where data carries

157
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,039
inherent context based on the source

158
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,560
that means that if you're extracting

159
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,240
indicator lists that are flat like what

160
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,400
the one that trey has shown without any

161
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,639
metadata around the information it can

162
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,240
still be useful as long as it is coming

163
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,360
from a source where you

164
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,120
know the intent of why that data was

165
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,639
shared in the first place for example

166
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,639
tracking certain types of threat actors

167
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,120
tracking certain uh

168
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,919
evolving infrastructure points for the

169
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,199
same type of attack

170
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,440
or if it's one of those metadata feeds

171
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,880
for example one of the ones that we use

172
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,639
is also the tor exit node list

173
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,880
that we use to quickly identify whether

174
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,560
an ip address is actually

175
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,800
belonging to attacker infrastructure

176
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,240
it's just a toward exit node so whenever

177
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,639
we're dealing with this sort of

178
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,880
lists what we are about to talk about

179
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,479
does not apply obviously

180
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,000
so we're not here to talk about the

181
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,160
exception of course so let's get back to

182
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,919
on track with the talk so

183
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,520
first of all that flat indicator list

184
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,360
if i had if it just had a title

185
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,319
what is it that would have helped me so

186
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,280
much

187
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,520
as a recipient um so

188
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,280
as a producer consider on the receiving

189
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,919
end

190
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,120
that it's not just some machine some

191
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,720
data processing

192
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,800
thing that's going to be eating up a

193
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,319
list of hashes

194
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,759
but that there's going to be a human

195
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,080
being involved

196
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,199
in at some step in the process so at

197
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,919
least

198
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,840
include some kind of title on your

199
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,520
report

200
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,840
wherever possible include some prose

201
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
explanation uh it doesn't

202
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,039
in any way have a negative impact on

203
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,319
the ability for uh defensive

204
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,840
mechanisms you know appliances

205
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,919
endpoint protection

206
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,360
to parse that out but if

207
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,840
if you think about that that list of

208
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,280
flat indicators

209
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,599
that's like uncommented code

210
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,720
i don't just comment code

211
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,199
because of future maintainability for

212
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,400
other people

213
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,639
i comment my code because three months

214
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,440
from now

215
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,520
i come back and i look at a thing and i

216
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,639
have no idea what i was trying to do so

217
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,400
when you put some basic prose

218
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,199
on your threat reports it corresponds

219
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:05,840
with

220
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,960
the data points that you're conveying

221
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,639
you're not only helping a recipient

222
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,319
externally but you

223
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,240
you're you're practicing something good

224
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,080
that's going to help you down the road

225
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,000
as well so apart from

226
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,599
assigning contacts one of the things to

227
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,879
get right and this is something that is

228
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,080
often overlooked

229
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,000
is you're dealing with it very often

230
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,440
when you're sharing information with a

231
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
large constituency of different types of

232
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,720
organizations out there

233
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,080
one of the things that you should also

234
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,839
consider is that

235
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,519
these organizations will or in this

236
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,039
community and everyone in your community

237
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,519
will

238
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,039
use the data differently you need to

239
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,719
give them some

240
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,159
some guidelines on what they're allowed

241
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,919
to do with the data who they can share

242
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,519
pass the information on

243
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,080
so when it comes to deciding what can be

244
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,360
done with the data one of the things to

245
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,880
consider is

246
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,399
can it be used for example for active

247
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,080
measures are you worried about informing

248
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
the attacker potentially and burning the

249
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,600
the fact that you know this information

250
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,440
in those cases there are some frameworks

251
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,480
that help you basically

252
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,519
to restrict uh or at least

253
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,640
and to mark the information to not be

254
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,279
used in the

255
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,080
in in those specific cases so pap is one

256
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,880
of those

257
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,320
examples for those libraries the

258
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,000
permissible action protocol it's very

259
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,600
simplistic similar to dlp

260
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,720
but the idea is it tells the recipient

261
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,560
what they're allowed to do with the data

262
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,720
the other side is that no matter what

263
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,080
tool you're sharing your information

264
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,640
with

265
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,120
that data will end up in a pdf report it

266
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,680
will

267
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,519
be shared with peers via phone calls and

268
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,680
so on make sure that you tell the

269
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,760
recipient of the data what they can

270
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,600
do with the data afterwards in terms of

271
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,200
extracting the data from the system and

272
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,959
passing it on to someone else tlp

273
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,360
ipf are great for this something else

274
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,800
that that might be

275
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,399
applicable to your community might be

276
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,080
also national classification schemes

277
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,440
military classification schemes

278
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,880
depending on what sort of organization

279
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,839
you're in

280
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,279
so within a threat report

281
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,560
every data point

282
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,880
has uh it's an element within an overall

283
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,560
narrative

284
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,000
so put context

285
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,959
around those data points to tell the

286
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,160
story

287
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,200
uh an ip address uh

288
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,560
was it a connectivity check for malware

289
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,120
uh was it a compromised host was it part

290
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,880
of attacker infrastructure

291
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,680
do you know what role it played as

292
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,000
attacker infrastructure

293
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,360
um a very useful tool uh

294
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,279
if we're gonna play some kind of

295
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,760
buzzword bingo here mitre attack

296
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,000
um but put some attack techniques

297
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,360
around those indicators um

298
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,839
and think carefully about what problem

299
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,519
you're trying to solve

300
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,120
with this all too frequently

301
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,399
i see threat reports where people have

302
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,240
thrown a bunch of miter attack

303
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,640
tags at the top level of a report um

304
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,680
i guess because we want to be hip

305
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,040
and keep with the times but scoping

306
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,240
matters

307
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,200
um does a bit of context whether we're

308
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,600
talking about pap tlp

309
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,240
are minor attack or what have you does

310
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,600
it really apply at the

311
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,000
level of the entire report or is it

312
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,440
specific to

313
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,000
a shaw hash an ip address a mutex

314
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,120
consider the utility of the context that

315
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,560
you're applying

316
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
and also think about the impact that

317
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,399
it's going to have down the road

318
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,040
when you try to do sort of longitudinal

319
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,160
analysis

320
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,160
across your entire data set

321
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,200
so going back to the individual data

322
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,959
points that we've talked about until now

323
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,640
most of the time when we're dealing with

324
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,000
information

325
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,920
we're not dealing with data points in a

326
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,839
vacuum they all

327
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,320
are part of a larger story and we

328
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,440
basically

329
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,279
can either omit this and share the data

330
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,360
points as a list or we can go the extra

331
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,720
effort and basically

332
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,399
also reveal this information and this

333
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,680
knowledge that we have about how the

334
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,600
data points belong together

335
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
think of the most simple use case very

336
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,000
often we're describing the same concept

337
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,320
by a different means that means if we're

338
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,760
sharing information about the file for

339
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,040
example a malicious file

340
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,560
we might include all sorts of data

341
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,079
points that relate to the file

342
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,600
now these things if we don't mark them

343
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,040
as something that belongs together and

344
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,320
that form

345
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,360
that basically where we use atomic

346
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,560
data points to describe something

347
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,040
complex this gets lost in translation

348
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,720
it means extra burden on whoever is

349
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,040
using the data on the other hand

350
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,639
whenever we are dealing with different

351
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,079
concepts when we're analyzing an

352
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,920
incident for example

353
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,240
we know the story of what happened by

354
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,000
analyzing our logs and so on

355
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
now it is really important to encode

356
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,360
this whenever we

357
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,920
want the recipients to anticipate next

358
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,519
steps of an attack for example if we

359
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,600
have a file an email a malware

360
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,519
and an attacker infrastructure in our

361
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,279
set of data points

362
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,360
we can phrase this kind of like a

363
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,040
sentence where we can say that this file

364
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,639
was attached to an email

365
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,959
and when we extracted data from the file

366
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,480
we saw a malware in there

367
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
which was then used to be to contact a

368
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,639
c2 using this attacker infrastructure

369
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,839
the moment you include that

370
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,839
you immediately build knowledge instead

371
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,480
of just data

372
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,240
so we build threat reports

373
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,880
out of our internal data that we've

374
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,440
gathered

375
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,120
from within our organization whether

376
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,800
that's a post-mortem from

377
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,680
uh incident response telemetry from our

378
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,959
network sensors

379
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,160
etc from external data

380
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,560
commercial sources trust groups etc

381
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,000
and often our reports are a hybrid

382
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,079
of internally collected data and

383
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,240
externally collected data

384
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,279
it's vitally important that you label

385
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,680
your source wherever possible

386
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,880
and that you label your confidence in

387
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
the source

388
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,760
always so sometimes you may not be able

389
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,800
to declare

390
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,720
and disclose the source whether that's

391
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,320
for commercial reasons

392
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,000
because your national security agency

393
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,160
passed along some super top secret

394
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,600
information

395
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,560
disclose the source for the data

396
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,079
wherever possible

397
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,880
disclose like put your confidence on

398
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,920
that data

399
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,399
always

400
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,279
so ultimately what the main reasons why

401
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,639
we're sharing information is to

402
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,680
basically help our

403
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,279
peers protect themselves and this should

404
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,040
be the ultimate goal that we can achieve

405
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,920
in different ways

406
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,480
besides sharing the information itself

407
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,760
one of the things that we can also

408
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,720
influence is how

409
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,040
useful the data becomes to the recipient

410
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,000
for example

411
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,920
if our if we're dealing with different

412
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,680
organizations with different maturity

413
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,399
levels

414
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,480
we might need to to also consider doing

415
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,920
a little bit of extra handholding that

416
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,440
we ourselves would not anticipate with

417
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,880
the data for example

418
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,320
including information that can be used

419
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,720
for indicator lifecycle management

420
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,959
such as for example trust in source the

421
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,079
sources trust in data

422
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,440
all these different data points that

423
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,519
trey has already mentioned along with

424
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,720
a bunch of different ways to

425
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,519
contextualize the data helps a lot

426
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,360
also we can give suggestions on how to

427
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
best use the data for example if we see

428
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,839
certain indicators that are best

429
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,240
used by analyzing our logs from our

430
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,880
scenes

431
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,160
in the seams or versus things that are

432
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,440
pushed to an ids

433
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,120
include that information with the data

434
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,959
so that whoever is recipient knows how

435
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,560
to make best use of it

436
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,240
on the other hand something else that we

437
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,440
might want to include and this is

438
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,399
different

439
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,040
from what we mentioned before about

440
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,720
encapsulating the data and telling the

441
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,160
recipient who they can share the data

442
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,880
with

443
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,639
another thing we can do is tell the

444
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,240
recipient who they should be sharing the

445
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,880
data with

446
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
who might be interested in it maybe this

447
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,800
is data relevant for any organizations

448
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,240
they know in the financial sector in

449
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,839
that case include that information so

450
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:46,800
that they know who to pass the

451
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,320
information along to

452
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,160
also if you have supporting materials

453
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,920
that you produce for the data

454
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,720
including reports that you've used in

455
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,839
your analysis

456
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,680
homebrew scripts that you've built sigma

457
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,279
rules and so on that you've built

458
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,959
yourself for your own detection

459
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,639
include those as well they go a long way

460
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,480
with helping especially lower maturity

461
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,560
organizations make use of the data

462
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,360
so configurations that means if you know

463
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,240
that something

464
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,160
exploits vulnerable configurations

465
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,440
include the information how to best

466
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,959
protect yourself against those

467
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,000
along with the data set

468
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,320
attribution now we touch the third rail

469
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,800
the purpose of attribution for

470
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,000
when you're dealing with cyber threat

471
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,639
intelligence unless you are working in

472
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,800
law enforcement or for a national

473
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,040
security agency

474
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,600
you don't really care about the

475
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,320
geopolitics

476
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,440
what you really care about is

477
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,720
understanding the modus operandi

478
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,320
and the goals of a particular set of

479
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,800
threat actors to help you to anticipate

480
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,320
how they might pivot within your

481
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,079
organization if you're

482
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,680
in the middle of a ir or a threat hunt

483
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,280
uh or for where you want to

484
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,760
deploy uh your preventative measures um

485
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,079
attribution focus on intent

486
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,039
modus operandi do not get hung up on

487
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,799
nation state geopolitics

488
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,599
so using some of these concepts that

489
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,280
we've mentioned before we basically have

490
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,559
here an example

491
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,079
of what data might look like in a

492
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,320
tabular form with all these data points

493
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,760
attached so you can see here that

494
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,360
basically we get a lot of information

495
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,880
along with each data point so we see

496
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,640
those

497
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,559
individual hashes and so on there that

498
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,760
are now part of

499
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,400
a collective so described in being a

500
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,520
more complex

501
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,600
concept such as a file such as domain ip

502
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,960
object and so on

503
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,720
along with different points of

504
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,039
contextualization

505
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,080
such as information about the malware

506
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
that is being used there so we see the

507
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,960
mlpdia

508
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,679
description we see mitra attack patterns

509
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,360
so those are highly valuable that we'll

510
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,960
talk about later on why they're really

511
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,320
important to include

512
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,120
as well as guidance on how to use the

513
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,799
data so what the user is allowed to do

514
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,400
with the data for example can they use

515
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,840
it for active research we see some of

516
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,600
those data points not so much

517
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,440
the other ones yes this kind of

518
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,760
information is already included

519
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,679
in this type of report and here we see

520
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,640
that same data but represented as a

521
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,520
graph

522
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
these are the same data points that we

523
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,280
started off with in that flat list of

524
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,480
indicators

525
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,600
but by simply doing a little bit of work

526
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,720
to show the relationships between those

527
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,760
now i could look at this picture know

528
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,520
nothing about your environment

529
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,000
and i could tell you the story of what's

530
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,400
happening

531
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,320
so let's talk about

532
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,679
how this would actually affect the

533
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,200
different user groups so we've seen the

534
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,000
basically the different

535
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,200
types of questions that we should be

536
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,960
asking ourselves when creating the data

537
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,120
and obviously this takes a lot of effort

538
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,200
so compared to just throwing out the

539
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,400
indicator lists

540
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,080
this means that you have to put in some

541
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,840
extra leg work but let's see how this

542
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,360
actually affects the recipients of the

543
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,240
data

544
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,520
so here let's start with the first

545
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
example with an incident responder

546
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,280
now one of the trickiest thing for an

547
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,960
instant responder is the amount of

548
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,080
pressure that you're under during

549
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,679
instant response that means that you're

550
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,480
basically

551
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,120
under time pressure which increases your

552
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,880
risk of misunderstanding data that

553
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,919
you're looking at

554
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,440
and misunderstanding concepts that

555
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,240
you're trying to involve in your process

556
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,520
so one of the things that we can do

557
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,360
basically when you're producing data to

558
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,600
to relieve this pressure basically is to

559
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,440
make it clear what the intent of data

560
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,000
points are

561
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,160
and to basically explain why those data

562
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,080
points are relevant in the first place

563
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,160
so in most of these cases when you're

564
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,280
dealing with instant response you don't

565
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,320
really care about

566
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,840
all the different data points that

567
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,280
someone else has seen what you care

568
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,400
about is the story

569
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,240
that means you use your individual data

570
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,520
points that you extract during your

571
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,080
process

572
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,960
as pivot points to find similar types of

573
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,520
data that

574
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,960
have been shared and then you look at

575
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,799
the story to anticipate what to look for

576
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,679
next for example

577
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,480
so for a sock operator different focus

578
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,440
detection and prevention i have yet to

579
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,320
hear

580
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,480
of anyone complaining that they didn't

581
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,320
get enough alerts

582
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,360
now the typical way of managing this is

583
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,520
by filtering the input data set

584
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,120
that you're putting into your alerting

585
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,640
tools

586
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,880
but the better labeled your data set is

587
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,919
with the more contextualized it is the

588
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,360
easier it is for you

589
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,520
to filter out what is and is not

590
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,400
interesting for your organization

591
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,679
uh so this enables you to

592
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,440
as a stock operator to make better

593
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,799
informed decisions

594
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,240
about when to search for something

595
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,280
uh what time span was it valid for where

596
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,039
might you want to look for it in your

597
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,960
in your organization um etc

598
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,240
it it dramatically reduces

599
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,080
uh the again the cognitive

600
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,520
energy load for a sock operator

601
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,799
having contextualized data

602
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,520
so contrary to a stock operator let's

603
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,679
took a different example maybe an isp

604
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,240
that is trying to protect your users

605
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,440
so this is one of those cases where the

606
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,280
risk appetite for false positives is

607
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,720
incredibly low

608
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,640
so when you're basically blocking data

609
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,320
for a large set of users

610
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,159
then blocking something by accident such

611
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,440
as facebook.com

612
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,919
might cause a riot or it might stop one

613
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,679
but that's a different story

614
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,000
but seeing what we have included

615
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,360
knowledge about with the data

616
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,840
we basically included information about

617
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,799
our trust in the data basically context

618
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,559
on why this data was relevant in what

619
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,320
context it has been seen what functional

620
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,159
role it played in an incident

621
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,159
and using these different data points an

622
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,919
isp would in this case be able to make

623
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,240
decisions on what is fit for blocking

624
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,600
and what will they use for their own

625
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,840
internal detection and so on but not

626
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,120
necessarily for the block list that

627
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,919
they're pushing to

628
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,720
a user so that they're blocking uh user

629
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,280
access to

630
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,120
so how would this look for a threat

631
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,520
analyst well

632
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,039
threat analysts um they're

633
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,320
more focused on the that mitre attack

634
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,360
type data the the

635
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,559
threat actor groups that they're

636
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,440
tracking their modus operandi

637
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,760
their goals so when we have

638
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,400
put that context into our threat reports

639
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:32,799
our

640
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,720
when the producers that we're relying on

641
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
have done so on our behalf

642
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,880
this makes the job of a threat analyst

643
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,799
so much easier

644
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,080
this calls out uh and highlights

645
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,080
data regarding attacker infrastructure

646
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,640
use reuse

647
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,559
and the evolution and uncovering of

648
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,640
of new attack vectors which you would

649
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,679
then track

650
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,159
so and now if we take all this data

651
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:02,400
let's

652
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,480
look at what risk unless can do with it

653
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,840
obviously they will not really care

654
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,520
about individual data points they don't

655
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,679
care what ip address your attacker used

656
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,200
what they care about is the aggregate of

657
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,960
the information that means that they

658
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,159
want to see trends

659
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,919
what sort of trends are affecting my

660
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,159
organization my sector my geographic

661
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,679
location and so on and this is where for

662
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:20,720
example attack

663
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,000
plays an invaluable role by including

664
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,159
the information on the actual attacker

665
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,840
techniques along with all the data that

666
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,720
we share

667
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,159
we can basically aggregate this

668
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,679
information and ask our different tools

669
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,600
the type of questions such as how did

670
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,960
the attacker patterns

671
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,320
change over the past year compared to

672
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,559
how it affected

673
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,799
our sector a year ago for example so

674
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,320
these sort of questions can easily be

675
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,000
answered as long as we go through this

676
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,559
effort

677
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,159
in the first place now keep in mind a

678
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,480
lot of this is done by the tooling

679
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,760
automatically nowadays

680
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,360
so as long as you just share what with

681
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,720
the information that you have which you

682
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,000
inherently have when you're looking at

683
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,799
the data

684
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,120
then you basically raise the the

685
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,080
efficiency of what

686
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,640
risk analysis can do with the data and

687
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,320
the output of that is basically that the

688
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,000
risk analysis can make better

689
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,679
give better advice to the decision

690
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,200
makers of the different organizations

691
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,279
and so we come to our final role

692
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,960
the decision maker inf a decision may

693
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,440
occur

694
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,760
better informed by their organization's

695
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,679
risk analysts

696
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,679
can make more evidence-based

697
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,039
and effective decisions regarding future

698
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,559
resource allocations

699
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,880
whether i'm trying to allocate budget

700
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,600
and

701
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,640
head count for next quarter or for

702
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,000
a five year time frame i i'm trying to

703
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,679
anticipate the future

704
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,279
so that knowledge about the evolution of

705
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,240
attackers focus and techniques within my

706
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,159
sector

707
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,200
um is is key

708
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
to making intelligence budgeting

709
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,480
decisions

710
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,360
um this third point uh sorry the second

711
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,240
point here

712
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,440
um when you have

713
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,520
all the data sources labeled all the

714
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,440
references labeled

715
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,799
then you can assess

716
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,720
which other organizations within my

717
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,159
region or my sector

718
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,159
have been sending us really high quality

719
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,440
data they

720
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,279
seem to be at a high level of maturity

721
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,640
or they seem to be

722
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,000
uh well confronting this similar type of

723
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,360
threat actor well so as a decision maker

724
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:33,760
i can

725
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,360
reach out to my uh my peer

726
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,080
in these other organizations to enter

727
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,200
into a dialogue

728
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,120
this is also a type of information

729
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,320
sharing right it's

730
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,840
not in json or xml but equally important

731
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,080
and lastly but not least

732
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,520
a lot of budget goes into the

733
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,240
procurement of commercial threat feeds

734
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,679
knowing how

735
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,880
a given threat feed um

736
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,679
has been useful or not to my

737
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,320
organization

738
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,120
how applicable the data that they've

739
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
given me has been

740
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,600
to enhancing the defensive posture of my

741
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,559
organization

742
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,240
that's the key to making good budget

743
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,840
decisions and also

744
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,720
if within that aggregate data set that

745
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,520
my organization has

746
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,960
taken in i can see other data sources

747
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,240
labeled that gives me a place to go and

748
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,880
look

749
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,320
for possible additions to my my basket

750
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,600
of commercial

751
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,799
feeds so

752
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,279
to sum it all up i mean one of the

753
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,039
things that that we try to show here is

754
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,360
that

755
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,600
well-structured context to rich data is

756
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,559
good

757
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,120
obviously it takes a lot of extra work

758
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,880
but hopefully we managed to encourage

759
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,600
people to

760
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,520
to see to see the benefits of going

761
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,039
through this effort even if they don't

762
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,480
directly use it so for example if you're

763
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,559
an organization just doing detection

764
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,480
perhaps you don't care about all these

765
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,919
additional contacts but keep in mind

766
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,440
that if you're in a community you kind

767
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,159
of

768
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,000
want to make it work for the other

769
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,240
parties as well

770
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,000
you have a lot of advantages if you if

771
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
you spend the extra time

772
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,080
uh basically we already have a lot of

773
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,919
tools that pre that allow us to produce

774
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:20,880
this data

775
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,960
but we are not using any of those really

776
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,640
to the full extent and this is

777
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,760
time constraints uh the lack of uh

778
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,320
of basically investment uh time

779
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,000
investment in the into these processes

780
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,799
and so on

781
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,120
so i hope that we managed to at least

782
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,320
ignite

783
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,240
the spark in a few people to basically

784
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,080
go a little bit beyond

785
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,279
with what they share and what they

786
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,200
include with their data and if you're

787
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,760
under

788
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
seeping and you're paying for for feed

789
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,039
vendors out there

790
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,960
don't settle for undifferentiated crap

791
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,039
uh raise hell until you basically get

792
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,799
your data will contextualize instead of

793
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,279
just flat indicator lists

794
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,320
that's basically it from us if you want

795
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,760
to reach out to us

796
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,279
thank you so much for your time

797
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,360
and we're not going to read this slide

798
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,480
at you but we're going to

799
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
take your questions with what time

800
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,039
remains mike how we doing

801
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,000
thanks gents appreciate it um there are

802
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,120
three questions

803
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,480
queued up i think that we can

804
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,480
you know type answers to them but

805
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,159
generally i think they boil down

806
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,360
to two things those three questions one

807
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,200
is around

808
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,080
examples do we have any examples other

809
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,679
than some of the screenshots and things

810
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,760
i think in the presentation

811
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,840
of what good reporting looks like what a

812
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,200
good uh

813
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,080
contextual description of of indicators

814
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,960
looks like and then also

815
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,159
what tooling exists to to help i think

816
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,679
specifically

817
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,240
in capturing that information and then

818
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,720
uh

819
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,360
translating it into information that's

820
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,279
digestible for all of those different

821
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,840
stakeholder groups that you described

822
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,039
i mean uh yeah just to briefly go

823
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,480
through some of them i mean in terms of

824
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,000
tooling i mean

825
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,360
the good thing is that all the tools

826
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,640
that we use nowadays are improving the

827
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,399
attraction so be it from sandboxes

828
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,200
all sorts of collection tools uh all the

829
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,799
additional lookup tools that we've also

830
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,640
seen here during the conference

831
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,120
already allow us to to basically extract

832
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,080
this information

833
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,440
in an automated fashion and then it's up

834
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,720
to the analyst to do some cleanup

835
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,760
afterwards

836
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,520
as for examples of good reports that's a

837
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,000
good point um

838
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,480
i think what we can do is uh at least as

839
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,760
a fun example

840
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,120
is the thing that we used here we can

841
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,120
just tweet it out later on

842
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,679
uh with where so that you can look at

843
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,600
this very simple example of

844
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,200
where we went through for this talk from

845
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,880
the before to the after i

846
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,240
i hope that helps there were

847
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,360
uh taxonomies and tagging

848
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,720
structures that andres and i uncovered

849
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,039
in

850
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,279
crafting the sample that we use for our

851
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,559
screenshots

852
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,679
um even though

853
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,440
we use these tools every day and we can

854
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,720
blame andrush

855
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,200
in large part for making them some of

856
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,840
them

857
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,360
which shall remain unnamed um

858
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,440
it would be great to have some exemplary

859
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,760
threat reports available that was

860
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,840
something that we struggled with

861
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,200
um and maybe that is a work item that we

862
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,159
could take up

863
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,440
within the context of the cti sig

864
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,880
to have a repository an open repository

865
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,760
of tlp

866
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,799
white threat reports and

867
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,399
that you could point to and say hey

868
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,239
here this is what you should aim for

869
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,279
