sanofi and i'm in charge of cyber

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,160
resilience

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,000
so i'm very glad to introduce this

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,520
presentation

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,520
and i was part of the 2020 program

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,120
conference committee

26
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,160
um so mr benoit dupont is a professor of

27
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,760
criminology at the university of

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,879
montreal

29
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,120
the city that should have been welcoming

30
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,480
us this year

31
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,719
in june for the conference and he's been

32
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,800
having a lot of activities

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,720
uh sharing cybersecurity

34
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,000
trainings research centers and also

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,960
representing the

36
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,280
the research community in various board

37
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,720
of directors such as the

38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,080
cctx that said uh

39
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,200
mr bernard the floor is yours thank you

40
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,040
very much olivier and thank you for the

41
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,759
invitation

42
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,840
for having me i'm very aware i'm

43
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,040
speaking to

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,360
uh cyber resilience professionals so i'm

45
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,560
gonna try to

46
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,759
leave the uh academic lingua and try to

47
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,000
be very applied and to try to

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,960
uh provide some added value uh to that

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,600
will

50
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,640
be able to enrich your own work so the

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,560
title of the presentation is the craft

52
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,759
of cyber resilience

53
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,240
lessons from the trenches and the

54
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,040
perspective

55
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,560
of uh uh this talk is to try to

56
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,040
understand what practitioners and cyber

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,280
security professionals and i'd like to

58
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,439
say that name shift to cyber resilience

59
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,960
professionals now

60
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,200
practice resilience on a daily cyber

61
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,640
resilience

62
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,159
and how they practice it on a daily

63
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,878
basis so a quick definition of cyber

64
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,959
resilience maybe for those of you

65
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,959
who might not be as familiar with it

66
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,760
it's the capacity of an organization to

67
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,640
limit

68
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,879
the impact of cyber disruptions to

69
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,840
maintain

70
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,640
functions to resume very quickly normal

71
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,920
operations and

72
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,160
something that to me is very important i

73
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,959
believe

74
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,120
in cyber resilience is the ability to

75
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,480
learn and

76
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,599
to adapt to the evolution of cyber risks

77
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,720
and cyber threats and in in

78
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,040
many dimensions i think cyber resilience

79
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,560
is an entirely different

80
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,080
practice than cyber security is it has

81
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,640
to

82
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,800
include and incorporate a lot of cyber

83
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,959
security best practices

84
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,200
but it also something that is quite

85
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,080
different

86
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,200
it's not past oriented you cannot it's

87
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,760
the

88
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
admission that you cannot predict and

89
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,280
prevent all risks

90
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,519
you have also to prepare to survive the

91
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,800
unexpected

92
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,120
it's not about trying to prevent failure

93
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,720
it's about

94
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,239
organizing yourself to fail safely

95
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,720
it's not about only focusing on security

96
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,360
technologies it's also understanding

97
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,519
how those security technologies are

98
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,000
incorporated into human systems

99
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,319
and it's not about protecting simply

100
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,720
your organization because you cannot be

101
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,799
cyber resilient on your own you have to

102
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,120
work hand in hand with many other

103
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,239
organizations

104
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,159
in your extended network so it's a

105
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,000
holistic practice

106
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,599
i had planned to provide you with an

107
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,599
overview of maersk as the perfect

108
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,159
example of cyber resilience not

109
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,640
planned cyber resilience but forced

110
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,239
cyber resilience

111
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,720
you all remember the not petty attack

112
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,000
that mursk

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,080
suffered in uh june 2017

114
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,519
where's and i think it's a perfect

115
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,920
example because within seven minutes

116
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,280
the company lost all its computers

117
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,840
fifty thousand uh fifty thousand

118
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,040
computers

119
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,159
thousand uh a thousand applications all

120
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,840
its servers uh well not

121
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,360
fifty percent of its servers were

122
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,920
destroyed but all its domain controllers

123
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,560
uh were also destroyed phone lines

124
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,760
unavailable

125
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,720
the perfect storm the complete nightmare

126
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,279
and

127
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,839
uh its response so obviously it was not

128
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,759
cyber resilient because it

129
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,800
was the victim of such an attack uh

130
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
but the response the first response was

131
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
to abandon the crisis management

132
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,240
protocol

133
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,080
hire external uh consultants it also had

134
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,840
a stroke of luck because

135
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,000
uh one domain controller was found in

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,160
ghana because in ghana there was a

137
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,639
power outage at the time of the attack

138
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,919
and it was

139
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,400
actually able to rebuild the network

140
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,199
from

141
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,240
that single domain controller but also

142
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,919
the human element played a very

143
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,759
important part the employees were able

144
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,040
to maintain

145
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,639
traffic via manual processes for 10 days

146
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,639
using their own personal gmail

147
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,280
accounts and whatsapp accounts and excel

148
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,160
sheets

149
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,759
and that's a good example of forced

150
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,320
resilience and the company was able to

151
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,600
build to rebuild

152
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,919
its whole systems in four weeks at a

153
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,120
massive cost so

154
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,199
if it had been more prepared for it

155
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,280
probably the cost would have been much

156
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,240
less uh but in the end it's it's a it's

157
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,520
a it's a

158
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,800
story that ends well so

159
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,000
the purpose of my talk is to examine

160
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,560
how companies can prepare better for

161
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,720
this kind of attacks massive attacks

162
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,600
and the way i did it is i did a research

163
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,160
over

164
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,440
for two years interviewing um

165
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,400
almost 50 cybersecurity professionals in

166
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,080
the financial sector it's a

167
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,840
study that was sponsored by the global

168
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,479
risk institute in financial services in

169
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,000
toronto

170
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,039
where i interviewed those practitioners

171
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,400
from 28 companies

172
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,720
also consultants providing incident

173
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,520
response

174
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,000
services and regulators across five

175
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,120
countries canada

176
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,400
the us the uk france and the netherlands

177
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,120
and the question was in the context of

178
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,039
many consultant reports

179
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,600
selling trying to sell cyber resilience

180
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,680
and academics trying to build

181
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,240
very elegant models of cyber resilience

182
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,160
the questions of the study where

183
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,039
how do you guys and girls on the first

184
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,319
line of defense

185
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,600
understand and practice cyber resilience

186
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,720
and what works

187
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,600
what doesn't and why so this is the the

188
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,000
gist of my presentation today

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,919
um if you want you can read the full

190
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,759
report i've got a link at the end of my

191
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,880
presentation

192
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,000
and i identified in this study

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,120
a dozen best practices uh

194
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,599
in the field of cyber resilience i i

195
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,919
bucketed them in in three main buckets

196
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,479
the sense making practices how do you

197
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,319
interpret your risk landscape

198
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,080
what kind of challenges do you meet in

199
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,479
the process the response packet that's

200
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,639
what i'm going to talk about today

201
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,479
and the adaptation bucket i'm going to

202
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,840
slightly touch on that

203
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,960
as well today in terms of uh

204
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,199
incident response as a as a cyber

205
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,080
resilience

206
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,120
tool i think out of the interviews and

207
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,840
and from now on what i'm going to uh

208
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,199
share in this presentation

209
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,680
is not my knowledge it's the knowledge

210
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,120
of those 44 people

211
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,080
i interviewed uh and the results of the

212
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
analysis of those interviews so it's not

213
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,639
benoit upon talking anymore it's 44

214
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,319
cyber security experts

215
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,720
so their responses highlight that the

216
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,919
human factor

217
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,880
was probably the most important element

218
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,680
uh to become

219
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,479
cyber resilient and many people told me

220
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,199
people

221
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,560
trump um

222
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,280
computer systems and procedures uh any

223
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,960
time of the day when dealing with

224
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,680
extreme extremely disruptive cyber

225
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,520
attacks the people your people are going

226
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,680
to save the company not your systems

227
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,840
because the systems have failed already

228
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,319
your cyber security systems have failed

229
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,360
so it's you know trying to look for

230
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,919
the personal and psychological traits of

231
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,039
high performing

232
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,319
incident responders their creativity

233
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,680
their flexibility

234
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,319
trying to find people and to add people

235
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,080
to your teams

236
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,319
who are very comfortable in high stress

237
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,160
environments and that means that doesn't

238
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,599
mean they have to be reckless

239
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,240
it means they're usually very calm very

240
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,520
good communicators

241
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,360
very good listeners as well because they

242
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,799
have to communicate

243
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,880
uh to the other business units within

244
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,958
your organization to

245
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,360
explain their decisions but they also

246
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,640
have to listen

247
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,799
from those business units uh their

248
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,959
concerns when the decisions that you're

249
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,279
imposing or making are going to be very

250
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,360
disruptive of the business processes

251
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,839
that still have to to be ongoing within

252
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,519
the organization

253
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,399
to be able to hire and to retain those

254
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,200
people

255
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
you have to deploy what i call

256
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,959
anti-boredom strategies

257
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,839
so some companies develop cross-training

258
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,800
programs

259
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,320
where when they're not responding to

260
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,560
incidents people are training

261
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,880
their peers other companies have

262
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,360
developed rotation systems where every

263
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
three months every six months

264
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,120
people are rotated from one

265
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,040
responsibility to another

266
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,720
because those people are extremely

267
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,399
curious are extremely

268
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,440
um active

269
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,480
and they need to be kept

270
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,959
at all times really interested in what

271
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,240
they're doing

272
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,800
of course you cannot only rely on

273
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,519
naturally

274
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,640
gifted people you have also to train

275
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,160
a lot of your incident responders and

276
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,279
the broader

277
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,440
employee community and most

278
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,240
organizations in the financial sector

279
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,519
do that using simulations and exercises

280
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,440
that they have to run regularly to try

281
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,920
to recreate the conditions of a cyber

282
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,640
attack

283
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,200
and the objective and the aim here is to

284
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,120
develop general resources

285
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,079
that can be adapted very quickly so it's

286
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:04,800
not to teach

287
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,320
something that you have you're going to

288
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,240
have to repeat when the crisis occurs

289
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,200
it's about

290
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,000
making people comfortable in crisis

291
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,040
environments

292
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,360
and the analogy that i heard again and

293
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,320
again is

294
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,360
developing developing muscle memory

295
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,519
so you have you want to develop people

296
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,640
who are comfortable

297
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,760
in uncertain environments and and to

298
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,959
achieve that you

299
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,800
may you should make your training as

300
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,240
realistic as possible

301
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,800
not too predictable not training that

302
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,360
still

303
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,720
that is done to simply comply with

304
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,200
the requirements of your regulators not

305
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,839
to check boxes and tick boxes but really

306
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,120
to

307
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,200
create challenging exercises for your

308
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,320
team members and not only involve the

309
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,040
the board

310
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,240
because very often simulations

311
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,160
are restricted to members of the board

312
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,800
but really have to make that available

313
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,640
to people in your incident response team

314
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,880
but also to the broader community so

315
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,560
people in business units you have to

316
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,839
start training them

317
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,519
uh how are we going to respond to an

318
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,120
incident in the case of nurse

319
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,120
the whole company had to be all uh

320
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,600
hands on on on ship um

321
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,519
many activities have been developed in

322
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,959
other fields i don't have time to go

323
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,959
into that but the defense sector

324
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,560
emergency response sectors have

325
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,120
developed uh tools and exercises that

326
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,079
can really enhance

327
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,839
the quality of the incident response

328
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,720
capacities of an organization many

329
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,160
organizations

330
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,279
are developing playbooks the importance

331
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,320
of the playbooks

332
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,680
is not what they tell you to do but that

333
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,160
you

334
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,240
have gone through the exercise of

335
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,160
planning how you're going to respond to

336
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,639
a crisis so i use a quote from

337
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,639
churchill that the plans are not

338
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,120
important it's the planning exercise

339
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,880
that led to these plans that is really

340
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,320
important because you

341
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,600
you develop a way a mindset that

342
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
places you in a space where you know

343
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,639
what you're going to do or if you don't

344
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,279
know

345
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,720
you you know how to think about

346
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,600
responding to this type of incident

347
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,360
from the banks are interviewed some of

348
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,279
them maintain

349
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,200
more than a dozen very specific

350
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,639
playbooks that they review quarterly

351
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,560
and don't fool yourself it's a very

352
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,760
consuming task

353
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,399
because you must incorporate a variety

354
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,040
of perspectives from all business units

355
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,200
to make sure that your responses

356
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,600
that are outlined in the playbook are

357
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,560
aligned

358
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,200
with the existing methodologies and

359
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,839
technologies that exist in your

360
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,880
organization so it's a very time

361
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,600
consuming but very useful exercise

362
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,480
but also what i heard is that it's also

363
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:44,800
as

364
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,040
important to teach people to follow the

365
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,079
playbook than to

366
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,040
teach them to deviate from the playbook

367
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,680
when you're

368
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,760
experiencing an incident that is not

369
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,680
recorded or not

370
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,360
included in the playbook so you have to

371
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,680
make people also comfortable

372
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,920
to deviate from the playbook when

373
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,079
they're confronted with surprises

374
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,800
so in a nutshell what you want to do and

375
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,040
what you want to create in your

376
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,240
insulin response plans and capacities is

377
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,959
less bureaucracy and more jazz because

378
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,160
jazz

379
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,200
and symbols are used to work with

380
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,320
minimal structures and they know how to

381
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,480
improvise but they know how to improvise

382
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,040
jointly to produce some very interesting

383
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,959
pieces of music and this is exactly the

384
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,800
kind of analogy that you want to use in

385
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,360
your

386
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,680
organization of course you cannot do

387
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,959
that on your own

388
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,200
you have to develop internal and

389
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,639
external networks

390
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,440
and when the crisis happens is not the

391
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,519
time when you are starting to build up

392
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,600
your network so you have to do that

393
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,560
before and as an ongoing activity so you

394
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,519
have to plan

395
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,519
the development of your internal and

396
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,120
external networking

397
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,079
activities internally you have to avoid

398
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,320
the segmentation of expertise so

399
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,760
companies are interviewed they detach or

400
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,720
the second

401
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,440
security workers in business units they

402
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,839
create fusion centers to

403
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,240
create a much better situational

404
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,079
awareness in the in the time of

405
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,560
crisis um some of them are also

406
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,279
developing

407
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,120
ambassador programs and the most

408
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,040
inventive i think solution not from the

409
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,399
banking sector

410
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,800
but from netflix they have created a

411
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,240
reservist program from

412
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,399
for incident responders so they are

413
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,519
training people

414
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,920
to be second line incident responders

415
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,760
volunteers like in the army

416
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,880
to to be able to disseminate this kind

417
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,079
of expertise

418
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,720
throughout the organization externally

419
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
you have to also maintain

420
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,040
extensive networks to be able to collect

421
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,720
information very quickly

422
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,000
and to access search capacities

423
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,839
we have to focus on third parties

424
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,680
especially in an environment where

425
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,160
we are relying more and more on cloud

426
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,199
services

427
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,279
and all those networks have to be based

428
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,279
on trust and personal relationship that

429
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,120
you have to build

430
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,480
again way before a crisis or a massive

431
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,920
cyber shock happens to your organization

432
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,680
you have to learn to adapt this is a

433
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,519
very important

434
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,320
capacity you have to develop the

435
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,560
ultimate goal of cyber resilience

436
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,440
is not survival but also learning to

437
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,240
thrive

438
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,079
in a new risk environment and some of

439
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,839
the companies i interviewed actually

440
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,639
they used

441
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,120
the massive incidents and crisis they

442
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,320
had to go through

443
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,360
to develop new business offerings to

444
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,720
their customers and that's a very

445
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,519
interesting

446
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,000
idea that the crisis is going to add

447
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
value to your business proposition once

448
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,360
you've survived it

449
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,880
uh it's a bit counterintuitive so

450
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,040
often you want to develop post-incident

451
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,000
reviews

452
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,639
that reveal the inadequacies of existing

453
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,160
security measures

454
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,000
and the response processes that you have

455
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,519
in place and that advocates

456
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,920
changes and that's very political so you

457
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,079
have to create a safe environment for

458
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:00,959
people

459
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,079
to be able to collect and to share

460
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,480
embarrassing data and some of the

461
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,279
organizations i visited and interviewed

462
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,320
uh have developed a no-fault learning

463
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,040
approach where even the people at the

464
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,240
source of the crisis

465
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,279
were protected from the repercussions

466
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,480
so that uh they could um

467
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,519
really share uh their perspective

468
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,079
very freely and the organization could

469
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:30,880
start

470
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,040
to design adequate responses

471
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,480
there are many challenges to cyber

472
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,800
resilience i've tried to

473
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,040
outline them in this table there are

474
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,880
heuristics or biases

475
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,920
there are 10 of them based on knowledge

476
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,839
from disaster response and disaster

477
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,199
management

478
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,720
i don't have time to go through all of

479
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,079
them i think it's more important to

480
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,519
leave time aside for

481
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,320
q and a's but i'm very happy to revisit

482
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,720
them

483
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,399
with you and they'll be available in the

484
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,720
slides after the conference or you can

485
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,600
email me

486
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,079
and i'll very happily send you this

487
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,880
table

488
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,199
uh so i'm gonna stop here i think to

489
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,400
leave time for

490
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,119
q and a's but um if you want to learn

491
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,480
more feel free to

492
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,599
email me and this is a a screen capture

493
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,959
of the cover of the

494
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,679
full report i wrote that's freely

495
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,319
available

496
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,359
online for the global risk institute and

497
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,839
feel free to download it and and to

498
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,880
share it

499
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,960
with your colleagues i'm going to stop

500
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,880
the screen sharing here

501
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,559
and olivier back to you okay thank you

502
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,679
um we've got a few questions how could

503
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,440
proactive steps

504
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,840
helps in curbing unforeseen attacks a

505
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,880
question from

506
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,320
ankita siney so

507
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,440
proactive steps means that you are

508
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,400
trying to

509
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,280
maintain awareness of what your peers

510
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,919
your

511
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,960
competitors or other organizations in

512
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,919
your sector

513
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,360
are experiencing you're trying to model

514
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,440
uh the likely attack the most likely

515
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,880
attacks you're gonna suffer and you're

516
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,480
trying to train the whole

517
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,160
workforce for that and you're trying to

518
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,760
put systems in place

519
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,280
way before it happens uh to uh to to be

520
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
prepared so it's an investment

521
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,480
in um excess capacity excess

522
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,760
um resources and of course uh it brings

523
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,559
me back to

524
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,200
uh one bucket i didn't have time to

525
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,799
approach which is the sense making

526
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,440
bucket

527
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
where you have to explain to your

528
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,919
business units that the investments

529
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,320
that you need to make to be proactive

530
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,360
are are not

531
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,799
necessarily producing good uh return on

532
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,520
investments

533
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,320
now but that you need this money to

534
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,679
prepare for the future

535
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,000
which is very uncertain so to be

536
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,200
proactive the first

537
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,880
step you have to make is you have to

538
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,480
convince management

539
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,120
and the c-suite that they have really to

540
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,039
set aside resources

541
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,720
to prepare for this type of nightmares

542
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,160
that mers for example or equifax

543
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,080
suffered and actually those use cases

544
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,440
are very useful

545
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,720
to for you to convince

546
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
the c-suite people and the people kind

547
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,200
of who control access to the money that

548
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,000
so that you can then be operationally

549
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,840
proactive but first you have to really

550
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,640
convince

551
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,559
the whole organization of the benefits

552
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,679
of being proactive

553
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,000
and of the benefits of investing money

554
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,679
because you cannot be proactive without

555
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,480
any resources

556
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,799
okay thank you a question from nicholas

557
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,600
liu a question about the internal

558
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,559
networking for large-scale organizations

559
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,320
so do you see organizations having the

560
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,919
problem where there

561
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,960
are too many sub-organizations that want

562
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,600
to get involved or too many new

563
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,360
organizations being stood up

564
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,320
to the point where in convolutes your

565
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,080
incident transforming process

566
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
yeah it's a very good question and i

567
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,440
must say that

568
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,640
actually um because my study was done in

569
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,400
the financial sector context i

570
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,360
interviewed i

571
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,080
conducted interviews in organizations

572
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,840
that have like tens of thousands of

573
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,120
employees all across

574
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,720
and operate all across the world and so

575
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,840
i think that it's not necessarily

576
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,240
a barrier although you have to be very

577
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,520
mindful of that

578
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,440
and i think to overcome that challenge

579
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,679
you probably have to make sure that

580
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,880
you're as close

581
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,039
as you can be to conduct this kind of

582
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,000
networking

583
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,480
and to have the support for those kind

584
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,320
of internal networking activities

585
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,400
from the very very top of the

586
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
organization

587
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,520
so a very good example of one

588
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,720
organization

589
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,200
where i conducted an interview the ceo

590
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,320
was the former

591
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,039
chief risk officer and he understood

592
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,159
very well

593
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,000
the new risk environment and he was very

594
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,280
supportive of those

595
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,840
internal networking activities and once

596
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,960
he was behind

597
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,840
the internal networking activities as

598
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,919
one of the solutions to enhance the

599
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,200
cyber resilience of the whole

600
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,320
organization

601
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,520
it became much easier for the incident

602
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,640
response people

603
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,360
to be able to deploy those internal

604
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,000
networking activities and to justify

605
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,919
the resources and the time they needed

606
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,760
to conduct those activities

607
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,720
so i agree with you big organizations

608
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,280
can

609
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,200
um be a challenge and i think one

610
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
element of the response is do you really

611
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,480
have to get

612
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,039
support and i think one company i

613
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,200
interviewed they call that air cover

614
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,360
so if you're going on the ground trying

615
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,520
to do your operations and to do those

616
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,840
to to build this gel between different

617
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,520
business units and to create this

618
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,960
internal networking

619
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,039
you need to ensure that you have air

620
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,480
cover from the ceo

621
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,159
or the the cso or the person the the the

622
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,720
highest ranking person possible

623
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,960
to provide this message to the whole

624
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,080
organization

625
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,960
this is really important pay attention

626
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,600
to that

627
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,520
this is a question of survival for the

628
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,320
company and this also brings me to the

629
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,559
uh to another question about the sock

630
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,080
and the integration and the fusion

631
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,880
center

632
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,520
it helps if you're also able to create

633
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,799
to integrate

634
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,440
instead of creating a new organization

635
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,799
to blend together

636
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,240
existing um organizations that provide

637
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,960
these

638
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,200
integration these security functions so

639
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,720
the fusion centers

640
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,799
they're very interesting because they

641
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,640
it's a new entity but that brings

642
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,880
together existing entities

643
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,159
it's not set up or stood up outside of

644
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,240
existing entities it forces existing

645
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,360
entities to come and work together

646
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,760
on the same topic or extension what

647
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,440
about regulations

648
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,679
can cyber resilience be regulated for

649
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,320
example having regulated mandating that

650
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,600
organizations should

651
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,320
set up something so it's a very

652
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,919
interesting question we could have an

653
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,159
entire new session on that

654
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,480
so for actually for those very large

655
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,880
organizations it's part of the challenge

656
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,640
because the regulatory

657
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,039
framework when you operate in 60

658
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:05,919
countries

659
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,200
is very different around cyber

660
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,480
resilience some countries like the uk or

661
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,919
singapore or the us are already starting

662
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,120
to integrate

663
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
cyber resilience in their regulatory

664
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,159
requirements

665
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,880
others are lagging behind but when

666
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,400
you're a single entity

667
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,679
operating across multiple jurisdictions

668
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,520
you have to take into account all these

669
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,840
differences and sometimes

670
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,000
it's creating distortions it's creating

671
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,600
a lot of uncertainty

672
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,679
and it's making the the job of incident

673
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,039
responder

674
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,000
responders more difficult so i think

675
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,480
that

676
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,880
um the the people are interviewed they

677
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,720
found regulation very useful

678
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,440
when it's not too intrusive and too not

679
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,360
to

680
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,960
not providing too uh specific

681
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,400
guidance but it can also be

682
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,520
um confusing

683
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,240
when there is a flurry of regulatory uh

684
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,200
guidances

685
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,640
and you don't know exactly which ones

686
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,880
are the better and on based on

687
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,200
and what they're based and and and which

688
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,279
one you should follow so i think that

689
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,559
uh regulations and and

690
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,480
softer forms of regulations like

691
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,120
standards and standardization of cyber

692
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,080
resilience

693
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,880
we haven't really reached yet the

694
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,279
maturity that we

695
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,600
should expect and i think there is a lot

696
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,440
more work to do but some countries are

697
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,880
really trying to

698
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,039
embed cyber resilience in their

699
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,200
regulatory framework so that's something

700
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,880
it's something that's unfolding and

701
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,200
developing at the moment

702
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,279
so people should really follow that

703
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,080
space i believe

704
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,400
we've got a second question from akita

705
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,559
saini but it's a one million dollar

706
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,679
question

707
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,400
since the attack is unforeseen how could

708
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:54,720
it

709
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,640
be certain that steps taken are

710
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,240
sufficient to handle it

711
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,880
so very good question so you're never

712
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,559
going to be able to take all the steps

713
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,520
to handle it

714
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,919
what you want to do is you want to train

715
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:06,720
the people

716
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,520
you want to have a diversity of systems

717
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,679
that can handle a diversity of attacks

718
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,679
including attacks that you cannot

719
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,720
imagine so

720
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,200
what you are trying to do to develop and

721
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,799
to

722
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,080
train for is not a specific uh

723
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,039
procedure it's not to acquire a specific

724
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:25,600
system

725
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,480
to respond to a specific attack it's

726
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,440
what i call

727
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,320
general resources that can adapt very

728
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,120
quickly

729
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,559
and that have enough space mindset

730
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,760
and space to innovate and to respond

731
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,799
and to be as creative as your attackers

732
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,640
so it's a general capacity you're trying

733
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,799
to develop not a specific capacity i

734
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:47,600
agree with

735
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,080
ankita you're never going to be able to

736
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,840
plan for all possible attacks by

737
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,240
definition

738
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,640
another one from indiana cordova is

739
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,840
contingency plan

740
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,880
part of cyber resilience yes it is part

741
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,360
of cyber resilience if your contingency

742
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,400
plan

743
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,559
uh is also practiced if it's a

744
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,760
contingency plan

745
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,559
as i've seen in some organizations that

746
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,080
remains on paper

747
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,120
and that no one knows where to find

748
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,679
it's not part of cyber resilience it's

749
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,159
uh it's a document that's gathering dust

750
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,720
it's not helping cyber resilience if

751
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,480
your contingency plan

752
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,200
is part of a broader process where

753
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
you're consulting broadly where you know

754
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,640
where you're including

755
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,120
uh the perspectives of many different

756
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,559
business units

757
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,679
if it's a document that you use to train

758
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,320
people

759
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,360
to simulate attacks that you tweak at

760
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,919
regular intervals that you revisit

761
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,559
that you include also your external

762
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,000
partners into to make sure your

763
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,360
contingency plan

764
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,279
is not only internal but is able to

765
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,840
accommodate your whole

766
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,240
business network yes this is definitely

767
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,679
part of cyber resilience

768
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,440
and a few more questions why

769
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,279
crisis management plan need to be

770
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,080
abundant in some cases

771
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,000
so the reason is that because

772
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
crisis management plans are or playbooks

773
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,279
as they are sometimes called are often

774
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,520
built on very specific types of attacks

775
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,679
and as uh the previous question

776
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,120
um stated is sometimes uh

777
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,480
you have not envisaged

778
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,559
this type of attack because uh the

779
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,600
attacker

780
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,200
has uh completely shifted the the risk

781
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,240
landscape for you

782
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,360
uh and uh there is no way you could have

783
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,520
uh uh predicted what's gonna what's

784
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,640
happening so you're

785
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,440
if you're keeping on operating and under

786
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,200
an old risk model

787
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,600
the uh outcome is that you're not going

788
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,720
to be able

789
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,200
to understand and to make sense of

790
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,480
what's happening to you you're going to

791
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,159
be automatically

792
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,760
doing some things that maybe your

793
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,080
attacker is actually

794
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,200
following you do online or is kind of

795
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,520
expecting you to do because he's also

796
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,799
had access to your

797
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,679
crisis management plan so you sometimes

798
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,679
have to abandon it and i'm an academic

799
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,200
so i'm not selling anything

800
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,399
i'm not selling consulting services but

801
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,799
you just sometimes have to recognize

802
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,960
that it's more useful to abandon it

803
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,120
because all the premises under which

804
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,399
um on which the plan was built are wrong

805
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,120
now

806
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,159
and you have to start with a clean slate

807
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,559
and you have to really kind of build uh

808
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,399
the plane as you're flying

809
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,039
because this is the state of uh the

810
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,240
crisis that you're

811
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,039
experiencing so i'm not saying that it

812
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,720
should abandon the plan

813
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,880
every single time i i'm saying that you

814
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,919
have to also

815
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,399
recognize that sometimes this is

816
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,840
something you have to do

817
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,559
and to be able to do that you have to to

818
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,240
be very confident

819
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,120
in the ability of your team to replace

820
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,880
that plan with something else that

821
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,240
uh responds to the new current crisis

822
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,840
and that's something that takes a lo i'm

823
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,399
not saying it's easy it's something that

824
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,159
takes a lot of guts

825
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,320
and a lot of confidence in your team and

826
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,520
a lot of courage

827
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,440
and something very interesting that the

828
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,039
respondents i interviewed

829
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,840
also told me you have to be able to hire

830
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,559
people

831
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,120
who are also very acceptant of this

832
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,559
reality you're going to make some bad

833
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,720
calls you're going to make mistakes

834
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,880
and you shouldn't be paralyzed by that

835
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,399
you should keep on moving

836
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,880
and you should keep on making decisions

837
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,159
because otherwise you're going to be

838
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,279
paralyzed

839
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,320
the fighter jet pilots call that the

840
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,679
startle effect

841
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,520
and you have also to train people to

842
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,960
avoid the startle effect

843
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,000
uh final question one minute remaining

844
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,320
are

845
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,240
are there any experts or qualified

846
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,559
professionals in cyber resilience

847
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,760
other than incident responders

848
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,240
yes there there is a range of other

849
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,440
experts and a

850
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,080
range of consultants that you can call

851
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,720
on to

852
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,000
but um it's it's you know if you're

853
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,640
calling

854
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,559
if you keep on keeping those people on

855
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,039
on retainer

856
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,320
they can bring some very very um

857
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,440
specialized expertise uh but

858
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,120
wouldn't you want to develop this kind

859
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,799
of expertise in-house if you're a

860
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,720
massive or a big organization

861
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,039

862
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:25,840
that

863
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,559
wasn't um uh a clear-cut in the

864
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,600
interview is

865
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,320
uh i consulted some of them believed it

866
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,640
was better to develop internal capacity

867
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,440
others

868
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
were more comfortable bringing in these

869
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,520
external expertise but

870
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,120

876
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,000
realm

877
