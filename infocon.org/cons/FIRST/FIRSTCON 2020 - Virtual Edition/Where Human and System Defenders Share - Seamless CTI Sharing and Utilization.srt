1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
interesting session lined up for you we

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,560
have with us three distinguished

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,080
speakers from

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,840
fujitsu system integration lab rusuke

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,960
maswoka toshi and koji

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,519
and they will be sharing on similar cti

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,920
sharing and utilization

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,119
so before i proceed uh before they

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,400
proceed with the presentation let me

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,760
remind everybody if you have any

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,160
questions please put them in a q a box

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,080
so that the speakers can take them up

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,199
later

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,960
so now over to you uh rusuke

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,079
okay thank you adrie

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,079
uh so all right let's begin

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,840
hello everyone actually

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,480
the title is where

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,680
human and system defenders share

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,160
we are going to talk about seamless cti

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,800
sharing

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,239
and utilization

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,600
we are the party of researchers from

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,600
fujitsu system integration labs

25
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,400
i am ryu ryusuke masoka

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,000
the visionary of this uh project

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,840
and i'm going to play the role of

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,119
commander in this

29
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,920
presentation

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,759
toshi is toshtaka satomi

31
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,400
he's the architect of the platform for

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,079
this project

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,759
and he's going to be uh the supper or

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,840
combat engineer in this presentation

35
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,680
koji is koji yamada

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,799
he is a former third

37
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,920
member of fujitsu

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,240
he's going to be the grand soldier in

39
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,960
this presentation

40
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,000
we all are voting members of uh

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,040
oasis oasis cta

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,880
technical committee okay

43
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,239
please let us start the journey

44
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,319
so the journey

45
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,599
looks looks like this uh

46
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,360
road behind us first then

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,000
what happened in the sea of iocs

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,560
we will tell you where we found the

49
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,080
treasure

50
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,239
and the signpost we found on the way

51
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,360
then the bridge we built over the sea of

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,760
iocs

53
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,879
and then we're going to give the show

54
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,079
or demonstration

55
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,560
and then finally uh the message to take

56
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,680
for you to take home

57
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,280
the first road behind us

58
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,400
a long time ago about 30 years ago a

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,080
journey with the cyber threat

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,280
intelligence or cti started

61
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,560
initially only a few very limited people

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,519
from a secretive agency had access to

63
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,640
their precious

64
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,480
ios iocs or indicated as a

65
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,720
compromise then those iocs like ip

66
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,120
addresses are shared within a wider

67
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,480
organization for their threat hunting

68
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,599
eventually communities like uh

69
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,560
isaac's is an open source and a

70
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,040
commercial cti providers appeared

71
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,400
and people now have access to abundance

72
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,319
of iocs

73
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,440
we have come a long way since the

74
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,400
initial time

75
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,640
but

76
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,680
somehow we found ourselves drowning

77
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,599
in the sea of iocs surrounding

78
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,080
surrounded by too many ip addresses

79
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,760
domain names our hash values etc

80
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,439
etc well what happened to koji

81
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,439
okay let me explain hi everyone

82
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,399
i am koji amada i was an incident

83
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,238
response team member

84
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,479
being engaged in monitoring security

85
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,400
around from our cloud infrastructure

86
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,880
the team has been collecting iocs from

87
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,080
open source

88
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,960
and also receiving iocs from several

89
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,160
isaacs

90
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,120
i guess many of your organization does

91
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,880
this too

92
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,000
however are we really making a good

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,600
use of biases i'm afraid

94
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,080
we are all drowning in iocs

95
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,040
i believe any organization would agree

96
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,280
that information is better to have

97
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,720
than not the cti sharing system has

98
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,280
become

99
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,560
much more developed at first it was

100
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,600
mostly emails but gradually

101
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,160
we have started a large amount of gta

102
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,440
sharing on the system

103
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,199
a few years ago i tried to utilize the

104
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,720
cti to enhance security monitoring

105
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,000
what i learned was that most cti was

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,280
ioc only and lacked the context

107
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,199
needed for action it was very difficult

108
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:31,840
to take

109
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,840
appropriate subsequent actions in that

110
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,400
context

111
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,960
suppose you receive an ioc of a

112
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,000
dangerous ip address and decide to block

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,360
that ip address for your customer

114
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,880
however the address has been de-used

115
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,160
and you upset the customer who was using

116
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,840
it for their business you could have

117
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,919
made a better decision

118
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,479
if you had the contextual information

119
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,120
like the

120
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,840
ioc's freshness

121
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,960
so where is context

122
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,120
so many analysts are regularly reading

123
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,360
security blogs every day

124
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,479
and sharing information on social media

125
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,039
and emails to learn about the latest

126
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,280
site cyber attacks

127
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,680
this is exactly the kind of treasure

128
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,639
we should be utilizing along with iocs

129
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,080
but we found that it doesn't work right

130
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,759
away

131
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,080
such human shitty is written in natural

132
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,520
language

133
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,479
it is tough for computers to interpret

134
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,199
and not

135
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,720
amenable to use it along with massive

136
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,400
amount of iocs available now

137
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,280
human analysts need computer support to

138
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,880
deal with a large amount of

139
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,240
data on the information

140
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,840
however unlike ioc's mass sharing

141
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,120
and distribution of human gti contents

142
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,120
in a format is for systems to

143
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,720
handle has not been considered

144
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,639
on the other hand it would be much

145
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,160
easier for various

146
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,160
types of systems to consume human gtr in

147
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,120
mass

148
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,599
if it is available in a structured

149
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,000
format

150
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,919
you will introduce a new concept to deal

151
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,080
with the situation

152
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,360
you hi okay

153
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,639
thank you koji

154
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,919
so here the signposts we found on the

155
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:54,400
way

156
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,000
or actually we created this to summarize

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,720
the situation so as for iocs

158
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,000
the full cycle of generation sharing

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,400
and consumption in mass has been

160
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,240
established

161
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,280
however for structured contextual cdi

162
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,720
um the we see generation

163
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,800
and consumption in some local systems

164
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,160
but we see very little of sharing if

165
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,319
not non-existent we believe we have to

166
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,519
change the situation

167
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,279
so we decided to build a bridge

168
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,679
to where human and system defenders

169
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,719
share

170
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,279
we call this bridge a simulated

171
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,720
intelligence platform

172
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,760
or escape

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,040
the core idea is

174
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,440
very simple everything in

175
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,360
social media post um emails

176
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,800
uh anything through taxi which is a cpa

177
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,600
communication

178
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,120
protocol or a mess

179
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,400
or pdf files local or on the web

180
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,600
[Music]

181
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,399
everything consumed by s-tip will be

182
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:14,880
turned

183
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,920
into structured cti which is

184
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,320
a sixth data stored in a single cpa

185
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,160
database built on top of

186
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,360
mongodb stixx

187
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,000
is a structured cta format being

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
standardized by

189
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,839
oasis cpitc along with taxi

190
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,120
then everything out from

191
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,480
us s-tip will be converted

192
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,440
to whatever format appropriate for each

193
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,720
outlet

194
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,080
from sticks data on the fly

195
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,519
so uh sns

196
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,959
or social media timeline

197
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,360
graph graphical representation of

198
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,399
cpi emails

199
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,760
or to the taxi uh outlets

200
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,959
uh ticketing systems orchestrators

201
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,480
security appliances uh

202
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,000
pdf files for uh to share

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,519
she get outside of sj uh miss slack and

204
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,079
so on

205
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,000
in the later demo you'll see

206
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,480
how uh how uh post to social media or

207
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,600
sns

208
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,360
turned into speaks and then the stixx

209
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,440
data turned into pdf uh also sticks data

210
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,839
shown

211
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,120
graphically for analysis

212
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,160
uh and integration with

213
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,079
a couple of tools

214
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,519
as mentioned the concept is simple

215
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,440
but it was not without challenges

216
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,320
actually there were many many challenges

217
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,800
to build this bridge

218
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,079
i i'm going to list uh two major ones

219
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,640
here the first one was semantic

220
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,480
mappings into sticks so uh social media

221
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:18,800
or

222
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,240
sns ports or other systems

223
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,480
which are not sticks compatible

224
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,600
or even sticks 1.2 to 2.1

225
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,360
there are many uh semantic gaps

226
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,839
that we needed to fill also our

227
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,800
internationalization and on

228
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,640
and on um the other one

229
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,240
was computational resources or

230
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,360
cost for passing sticks 1.2

231
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,680
in xml and 2.1 in json

232
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,720
was a pretty expensive

233
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,279
this is a kind of important

234
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,560
consideration for

235
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,760
us because we need to uh do a lot of uh

236
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,639
on the right uh conversion from sticks

237
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,120
to

238
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,320
uh from to other formats

239
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,279
so we decided to use a cache cache

240
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,079
mechanism

241
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:20,240
uh based on our db uh mysql to be exact

242
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,320
so those challenges are mostly uh dealt

243
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,079
or solved by a toshi

244
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,560
who he's the one who is going to

245
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,800
give the show or the demonstration

246
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,440
so toshi uh who is yours

247
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,760
okay

248
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:52,800
okay great way to share my desktop

249
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,480

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,279
address

266
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,240
it also includes a bitcoin address as a

267
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,600
hashtag

268
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,240

and gb number

271
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,720
when finished click this post

272
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,560
oh sorry click this post button

273
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,199
the dialog box appears the dialog box

274
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:57,839
shows the

275
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,040
result of ct element extractor

276
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,680
the city element extractor started ct

277
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,880
element changes like

278
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,720
indicators of compromise

279
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,560
ttp as a cb number

280
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,320
and select actor name from my post

281
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,839
let's keep all of them i'll click this

282
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,680
compose button to finalize it

283
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,959
uh wait i mean it's now loading

284
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,360
and my post has appeared on the top of

285
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,959
the timeline

286
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,440
ship has automatically converted my

287
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,320
unstructured post into structure 6 2.1

288
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,120
format and

289
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,839
accumulated into the 606 database along

290
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,079
with gta from other humans

291
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,839
and systems that is human cti

292
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,199
and system cti are merged into the same

293
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,399
single seek database

294
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,720
okay let me show you the fix file just

295
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,240
created from my post

296
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,079
wait on it let me bring in the window

297
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,959
just popped up

298
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,720
okay this is a fixed file as

299
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,720
you can see the six file is version 2.1

300
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,160
and with she generally she generates

301
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,800
like

302
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,240
a ip address and domain name

303
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,720
and value hash value in a structured

304
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,160
manner

305
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,959
i'll skip it but one can find title and

306
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,040
content tickets towards the end as well

307
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,839
we can also download this information as

308
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,399
pdf

309
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,120
okay this is very useful in case you

310
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,639
want to share the cgi with

311
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,360
people without access to this step

312
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,399
all right this spell has

313
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,279
done blue meaning new comment for my

314
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,880
post

315
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,399
you check it

316
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,160
this comment is from jesus christchurch

317
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,880
which is one of the chatbots of the sdps

318
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,320
module

319
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,720
db conscious has automatically searched

320
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,360
cti

321
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,079
the 82 month related to my pros in the 6

322
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:20,720
database

323
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,759
and report the results in this comment

324
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,519
let's see what tv conscience has to say

325
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,399
clicking the link leads us to the ctr

326
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,680
graph analytics view

327
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,120
all right this crowd shows the city of

328
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,920
rome my pot

329
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,040
in inks and noodles

330
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,120
this left style karma this city a piece

331
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,120
is related to my post

332
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,839
let's see what it means

333
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,160
another graph has appeared the two

334
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,399
graphs are linked through two factored

335
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,920
lines

336
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,240
both ends of the red line have the same

337
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,279
value

338
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,319
in this case this one

339
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,199
and this one the both nodes have the

340
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:11,919
same i

341
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,599
have the same high stack value of the

342
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,720
bitcoin address

343
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,600
there is another city idea to my post

344
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,520
all right it has useful information like

345
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,360
another cv number

346
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,959
how to deal with this attack

347
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,600
these three pieces of cdi are different

348
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,559
however

349
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,280
these red lines indicate the three posts

350
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,960
explained about the same attack

351
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,640
alright i'll pick a few examples of

352
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,720
receipt integrations with other tools

353
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,080
and quickly demonstrate them

354
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,440
the first one is with jira

355
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,679
jira is one of the most popular skating

356
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,440
systems in the world

357
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,600
i guess that the rating communication

358
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,679
with the domain continue

359
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,240
is too dangerous and decided to cut it

360
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,600
off

361
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,840
i'll ask associate operators to add the

362
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,080
domain name to the blacklist variability

363
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,480
i click the gear link in my post

364
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,880
after few seconds the jira window opens

365
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,600
downloading the data page all right

366
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,760
this is a gear page and this page

367
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,799
contains my

368
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,320
title and post with

369
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,840
pdf csv and the 6 file

370
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,799
i assign an operator and ask him to deal

371
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,200
with it

372
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,799
the second one is with bisp

373
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,120
misp is another open source thread in

374
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,159
changes platform

375
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,480
by clicking the remiss link in my post

376
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,039
i can share the cti to the myth

377
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,640
community specified

378
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,640
in the setting in advance

379
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,280
the last integration is with track

380
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,840
in fact ship has been communicating with

381
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,240
slack

382
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,960
as you can see here my post a few

383
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,200
minutes ago is already on the timeline

384
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,240
okay to summarize ship enables us to

385
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,799
generate structured context cti from and

386
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,640
structured information like natural

387
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
language settings

388
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,559
ship also consumes shares and utilizes

389
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,840
it

390
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,880
through structured contextual cdi ship

391
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,440
serves as a bridge over the sea drawing

392
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,120
many in the waves of non-contextual ioc

393
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,200
thank you for watching the show i am

394
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,799
toshi the sabra

395
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,600
back to you

396
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,480
okay thank you toshi and uh

397
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,400
i'm about to share my screen as well

398
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,679
okay thank you and uh

399
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,280
so the message

400
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,640
to uh for you to take home so

401
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,000
generation sharing and consumption flow

402
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,520
of c uh iocs in mass has been

403
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,559
established that's good

404
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,159
but now is the time to establish such a

405
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,360
flow

406
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,480
of structures contextual cti in mass

407
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,919
as well so

408
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,960
please join forces with us in this

409
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,840
endeavor

410
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,159
uh here's the ticket to where

411
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,480
human and system defenders share

412
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,600
s-chip is available as open source

413
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,559
software on

414
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,360
github i hope you enjoyed this

415
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,240
enjoy the journey with us thank you for

416
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,520
attending

417
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,960
this session uh back to uh

418
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,520
adeli

419
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,320
yep thank you toshi and koji for the

420
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,000
very interesting presentation i really

422
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,919
and a few people also love the

423
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,720
references made from edinburgh

424
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,840
i believe

425
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,480
i believe there is a poll that you want

426
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
to do before you go into the q a

427
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,200
oh yeah yes yes yes yes josh can you

428
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,840
help us with the poll

429
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,440
so please feel uh if uh if you can

430
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,320
uh these are questions about how you are

431
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,440
dealing with a

432
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,320
cti and

433
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
yeah if everybody can help uh fill up

434
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,399
the poll or do the poll for us

435
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,770
so do do we wait for the poll to finish

436
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,320
[Music]

437
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,840
do we go for q and a

438
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,760
yeah maybe we can go for q a for the

439
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,440
time being can you see the q and

440
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,400
questions in the box all right it's all

441
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,919
from mark so you can take it up

442
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,240
what are some uh some from mark uh

443
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,280
what are some uh examples of human cdi

444
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,000
you refer

445
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,640
to as a security blogs and reports and

446
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,520
etc

447
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,039
in that slide so uh all right so

448
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,440
uh so we we referred to uh

449
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,520
security blogs uh by uh security vendors

450
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,200
like uh fire eye crowd strike and so on

451
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,799
sometimes it's in a texture form and uh

452
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,720
sometimes it is in pdf s-chip actually

453
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,159
kind of grabs those uh

454
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,080
security blocks or pdf and then uh do

455
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,679
the same kind of

456
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,720
person to extract cta elements and

457
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,000
put into the uh establish uh

458
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,360
into the sticks database

459
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,679
so yeah that's that's what it is

460
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,240
and uh

461
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,480
okay uh what did you why did you pick uh

462
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,039
sticks

463
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,240
as the uh cgi format to use

464
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,840
for your system so uh uh

465
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,559
people might think that stickers is uh

466
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,520
sixes for

467
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,039
uh iocs like ib addresses and so on but

468
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,960
actually being a member of oasis cgi

469
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,080
rtc uh stixx is a

470
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,279
kind of very expensive uh

471
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,400
standard for cpi and also

472
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,360
it is uh from a 2.1 uh

473
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,000
there is a customizable uh element as

474
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,960
well so

475
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,080
actually uh bitcoin address was

476
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,200
uh to

477
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,440
we use customizable object to include it

478
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,799
and so on so uh stick say we

479
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,600
pick sticks because uh it is a standard

480
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,559
and also

481
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:33,840
expressive enough to uh for our purposes

482
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,000
[Music]

483
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,360
so can you explain how you add

484
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,480
context to cgi on the sd platform

485
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,159
so yeah so uh sj uh

486
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,360
kind of extract from the uh uh

487
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,440
cj elements and uh in the case of uh

488
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:53,919
text

489
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,200
uh then add uh uh add them

490
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,400
uh in a structured manner if it is

491
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:00,880
already

492
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,159
in the sticks then it is kind of

493
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,080
goes into uh goes into the sticks

494
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,919
database

495
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,200
uh integration

496
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,880
i put uh so it's a kind of statement

497
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,320
but uh i i we haven't tried it

498
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,640
uh integration to high project uh we

499
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,679
haven't tried it

500
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,799
yet but uh i think that that's that's uh

501
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,679
that's uh something that we might do it

502
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,760
in the future

503
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,799
uh dennis uh why not

504
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,400
use miss app as a repository and sharing

505
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,840
platform

506
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,960
yeah i yeah that's

507
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,320
uh uh

508
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,439
another that's a kind of

509
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,919
yeah possibility a strong possibility

510
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,679
and uh

511
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,720
but uh uh

512
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,760
initially i i we started this project

513
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,279
uh miss was not a

514
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,400
kind of uh uh it didn't

515
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,679
have enough capability

516
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,440
or kind of it's not uh it was not using

517
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,000
us

518
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,200
sticks so uh uh

519
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,520
so we decided to go for uh kind of

520
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,320
interpolation with this

521
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,200
uh reynolds

522
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,240
the question is does sj allow typical

523
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,120
indicator

524
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,279
management tasks like uh do you put

525
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,919
duplication explode expiration

526
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,679
and in enrichment etc etc um

527
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,600
so uh that that kind of aspect is uh

528
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,240
still

529
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,279
weak to be honest with you but uh we do

530
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,320
uh have enrichment capability actually

531
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:56,960
uh we

532
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,720
use uh attack and uh also a

533
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,919
cycle a lu database to enrich

534
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,960
uh some of the indicators as well as

535
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,880
um uh

536
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,320
as well as uh uh cv

537
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,000
uh like a ttps like a cv

538
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,840
uh information and so on

539
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,720
i guess uh i have managed to deal with

540
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,760
all of them uh

541
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,720
i think there is one more one more sorry

542
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,600
yeah

543
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,960
can st process random rss or pml

544
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,200
add-on or any xml based data feed

545
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,000
okay so uh so uh

546
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,120
right now s-chip does not but

547
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,159
i i think it is a matter of adding uh

548
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,360
adapters to them so

549
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,679
uh yeah that's the answer

550
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,320
