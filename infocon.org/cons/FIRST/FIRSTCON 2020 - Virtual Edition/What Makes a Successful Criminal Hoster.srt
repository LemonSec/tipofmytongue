33
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,600
attackers need a place to host their

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,680
stuff they usually want to do it

35
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,159
on hosters that do not give them a hard

36
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:08,880
time

37
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,880

and today we're presenting results of

50
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,159
underground hosting research and

51
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,399
particular scope is what makes

52
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,920
a successful criminal home hoster

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,240
this session is going to be delivered by

54
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,439
me vladimir kropatov

55
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,799
and me federer yarachkin i will mostly

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,640
lead the talk and further will

57
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,240
answer your questions

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,240
so let's get started with introduction

59
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,600
of basic terms

60
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,318
we define underground hosting as any

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,120
service

62
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,239
to host components of infrastructure

63
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,640
with the goal of conducting malicious or

64
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
criminal activity

65
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,200
this is a very broad definition but it

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,160
also allows

67
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,959
to examine wide range of underground

68
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,319
activities

69
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,040
involved in provision infrastructures

70
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,920
components

71
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,239
to criminals such services can include

72
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,720
hosting on dedicated servers hosting

73
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,319
uncompromised assets

74
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,480
vps fast looks infrastructures

75
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:51,440
and annualization services like proxies

76
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,480
so who are successful underground

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,840
hosters

78
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,120
on our opinion with the people

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,480
or groups who are able to

80
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,879
operate over a long period of time

81
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,080
many of such posters like yali shanda

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,599
has been discussed publicly

83
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,840
or by prime cribs and many other

84
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,879
and many hours are still well known like

85
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,519
praisers and we will discuss them a bit

86
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,080
later

87
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,720
so what has services with bph or

88
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,680
bulletproof hosting tend to provide

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,239
of course dedicated hosting solutions

90
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,120
and virtual hosting solutions

91
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,319
fast flux service protection and

92
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,280
anonymization especially service

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,239
protection is

94
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,400
it's an interesting part of bulletproof

95
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,480
infrastructures

96
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,200
additional infrastructure provision and

97
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,760
much

98
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,439
more so let's see

99
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,000
so actually if you look into

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,439
bulletproof hosters we often

101
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,519
have lists of acceptable and

102
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,560
non-permitted

103
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,799
services and this lists are

104
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,399
almost always present in bulletproof

105
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,120
advertisement

106
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,600
where often slas which include

107
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,360
additional parameters

108
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,240
like time from purchasing service to

109
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,440
service delivery

110
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,479
or warranty of the service

111
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,800
in some cases a warranty can measure it

112
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,160
just

113
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,759
for example 4 hours or 12 hours in other

114
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,199
cases criminals able to provide

115
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,520
way more reliable infrastructure

116
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,199
and actually reputation is one of the

117
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,960
important things on the underground

118
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,039
and on the cases and services related to

119
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,600
underground or bulletproof hosting

120
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,320
sometimes

121
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,520
it is possible to spot feedback

122
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,280
to the hosting when customers remember

123
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,320
all times when hosting

124
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,880
was advertised on the underground forums

125
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,120
and despite now this is a white

126
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,320
business uh

127
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,160
some customers still pointing out that

128
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,759
it was a business in gray or black

129
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,680
or dangerous underground areas before

130
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,240
what we actually believe that there are

131
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,360
no ultimate

132
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,880
bulletproof hosting or service

133
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,840
that exists very long time without any

134
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,960
restrictions on the content

135
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,039
which is hosted many of

136
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,759
a major projects try to create bbh

137
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,960
hosting

138
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,360
which can accept all types of the

139
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,120
content

140
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,080
but what we see we are often shutting

141
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,720
down

142
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,000
or law enforcement or just

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,160
rated their locations

144
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,520
bph are successful because

145
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,479
we're able to carefully select what kind

146
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:22,800
of

147
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,240
customers we are work with often leaving

148
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,840
public space and

149
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,800
criminal forums all together and we are

150
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,440
extremely

151
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,039
picky about type of the content

152
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,840
which will host and in which location

153
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,680
many bph hosting start your business

154
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,160
from dedicated forums

155
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,000
but now we see several places

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,560
where the deals are going on and where

157
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,520
buyers and sellers interact because

158
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,120
business evolve

159
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,000
so we can see underground forums

160
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,919
dedicated shops

161
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,919
messenger and even social media

162
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,680
platforms

163
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,240
so this is an example of the

164
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,440
advertisement of bulletproof hosting

165
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,319
at russian social media network vk which

166
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:18,639
is

167
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,479
known like russian version of the

168
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,319
facebook

169
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,000
and nobody hide here we just advertise

170
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,800
bulletproof service which is suitable

171
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,440
for

172
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,240
mass con and mob and many other

173
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,960
activities

174
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,720
many hosters grow and start having very

175
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,400
solid often government customers

176
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,520
but we are sometimes still supporting uh

177
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,879
their old customers and sometimes it's

178
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,080
pretty visible

179
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,520
uh if you look how particular autonomous

180
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,160
system

181
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,280
is connected with ours so

182
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,400
here we can see for example

183
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,080
zormo bv which is described

184
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,360
as a high risk isp

185
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,479
and what we figure out when we

186
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,800
visited uh this isp page

187
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,960
we advertise what we provide services

188
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,080
not just for legitimate customers but we

189
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,479
have

190
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,759
experience to host website of government

191
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,000
agencies and at the same time on the

192
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,719
forums

193
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,120
we can see advertisement of bulletproof

194
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,880
hosting for hype

195
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,838
from the same isp

196
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,480
what we witness it in our research

197
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,440
but not just hosting services are

198
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,880
important

199
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,640
but for example gdos protection part is

200
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,320
really important because criminals

201
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,120
are often compete with each other and

202
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,080
what means that

203
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,600
they can order for example gdos attacks

204
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
our own competitor underground forums

205
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,519
and we can see advertisement of the dos

206
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,959
protection services

207
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,480
at the underground and another

208
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,920
important thing kind of capture

209
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,360
which protects assets like forms from

210
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,720
scraping

211
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,839
and from appearance of non-native

212
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:28,720
speakers

213
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,440
on the right side you can see several

214
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
examples

215
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,000
for the captcha and don't be surprised

216
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,519
it's not the captcha where

217
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,680
people have to recognize a picture of

218
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,560
the train or plane or boat

219
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,640
because criminals are able to solve the

220
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,680
sculptures

221
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,279
with their services which are

222
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,640
generally have ai or real humans on the

223
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,080
back end

224
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,120
so and they come out with our version of

225
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,560
capture

226
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,360
where people have to recognize uh

227
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,079
questions

228
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,440
or and to show verse skills in i.t

229
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,640
industry so how to handle for example

230
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,240
unix or administrative unix systems

231
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,360
calculate mathematical equations or

232
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,720
know some culture related things so for

233
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,360
example

234
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,959
how many dalmatians are

235
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,680
in the name of well-known cartoon so

236
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,120
many people can answer

237
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,200
all over the world but if you look into

238
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,160
the last question

239
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,360
how many codes are known

240
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,160
and the original question which was

241
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,600
translated like how many

242
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,760
goes unknown in the well-known song

243
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,279
non-native speakers are unable to

244
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,519
reply these kind of questions or this

245
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,720
kind of question

246
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,399
like what is the article of russian

247
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,320
criminal code related to fraud

248
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,680
so infrastructure protections protection

249
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,399
services

250
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,600
it's a part of underground hosting

251
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,240
services

252
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,279
and it's barely mentioned uh

253
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,720
by journalists somehow

254
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,560
social and networks will already discuss

255
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,720
but media networks it's in our media

256
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,440
not media but uh messenger networks like

257
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,360
telegram are very popular

258
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,200
among criminals to advertise the

259
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,399
services

260
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,240
and here we can see advertisement of

261
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,920
service which is more than 10 years old

262
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,360
and actually not

263
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,880
just advertisements are available on the

264
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,480
platforms

265
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,079
so bots on telegram are widely used

266
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,480
uh as as shops to sell

267
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,079
underground hosting in this boss

268
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,959
you can see advertisement of credentials

269
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:55,519
just to

270
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,240
show the credibility and

271
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,160
it is possible to choose

272
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,440
many services like nrdpxs or

273
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,480
vps or other services and to make a

274
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
purchase it's just necessary to send

275
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,360
money on particular e-wallet with

276
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,320
particular comment

277
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,360
so let's think what successful

278
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,800
infrastructure or what makes successful

279
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,920
value proof foster

280
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,959
were several angles of these so

281
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:35,920
economical

282
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,959
ecosystem it means the hosting should be

283
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,839
profitable

284
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,120
because majority of criminal market

285
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,399
comparing to market related to

286
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,600
advanced persistent threats it's about

287
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,639
monetization so we would like to

288
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,279
highlight

289
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,160
several trends which we're witnessing

290
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,639
now

291
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,320
on the underground so first trend

292
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,079
is a trend which called

293
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,600
cloud of logs so it's

294
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,800
a business model when criminals not

295
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,839
using locks from just particular steeler

296
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,399
or malware but we're combining with

297
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,560
locks from many sources

298
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,839
into the cloud and selling access

299
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,040
to the cloud which contains terabytes of

300
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,000
data

301
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,720
data from hundreds thousands of hosts

302
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
and this data

303
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,760
categorized by geographical location

304
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,600
by type of the credentials

305
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,079
so it could be stolen credit cards with

306
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:40,720
cookies

307
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,839
what could be paypal accounts but were

308
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:44,880
many

309
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
very interesting things related to

310
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,320
hosting

311
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,880
we could be compromised it hosts with

312
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,560
rdp or hvnc

313
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,839
access and more interesting things

314
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,199
it's access to corporate consoles of

315
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,320
well-known cloud service providers where

316
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,160
criminals can provision

317
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,680
their own vms inside the criminal

318
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,079
infrastructure

319
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,639
and of course this really changed the

320
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,920
threat landscapes for

321
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,880
big companies because criminals are able

322
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,120
to monetize

323
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,399
compromised assets way faster and more

324
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,079
effective because expert in monetizing

325
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,360
for example rdp access will

326
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,279
exfiltrate data from the cloud which

327
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,800
related to rdp and monetizes

328
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,360
criminals who are able to monetize

329
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,959
finance financial

330
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,600
access will monetize credit cards or

331
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,639
paypal account

332
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,680
and so on and we're expert in this so

333
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,560
this really

334
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,800
cut off the time of reaction for the

335
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,839
bridges

336
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,959
for corporations

337
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,160
and of course criminals using tools to

338
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,519
automate your jobs on the

339
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,880
right side you can see an advertisement

340
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,399
from underground forum

341
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,079
which is give banner which shows

342
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,199
a functionality of a tool called rdp

343
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,800
multi-tool

344
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,360
where many credentials can be processed

345
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,920
at

346
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,000
the same time and customer or buyer can

347
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,040
perform many

348
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,440
actions simultaneously on many assets

349
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,560
and as we see on the recent interview

350
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,880
from revel very evil

351
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,120
rdp is one of the most vulnerabilities

352
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,320
which is used to enter

353
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,839
infrastructure so

354
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,160
let's see some examples

355
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,800
like how we decided to structure the

356
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,160
services

357
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,079
and why the services are

358
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,959
successful in bulletproof hosting so we

359
00:15:58,959 --> 00:15:59,759
categorize

360
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,959
uh hosting assets in three types it's

361
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,160
costing on stolen

362
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,440
and compromised assets hosting with

363
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,240
short-term

364
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,519
lease where legitimate

365
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,639
isps are used to host assets

366
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,680
and own data centers and on the right

367
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,880
side we can see

368
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,600
a cost of this service which is grows

369
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,240
from hosting on compromised assets

370
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,120
to own data centers

371
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,680
so why hosting on compromised assets

372
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,720
is abuse resistant

373
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,759
because criminals have very big pool

374
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,199
of compromised assets and the services

375
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,959
which are running on these holes

376
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,759
like scanning brute force attacks spam

377
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,480
campaigns

378
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,920
or proxies expected to share have

379
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,360
very short detail very low a short

380
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,720
lifespan which means that criminals

381
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,920
already done what we want

382
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,679
before abuse arrived

383
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,280
for the short-term lease services when

384
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,160
criminals

385
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,919
rent legitimate data centers

386
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,280
or in legitimate data centers what

387
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,319
means what we use particular slas

388
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,400
which are really adjusted with

389
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,319
geographical locations

390
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,079
so for example something which is

391
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,520
permitted in netherlands

392
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,240
will be never permitted in arabic

393
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,679
country

394
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,880
but since it's permitted and

395
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,120
nevertheless it could be hosted where

396
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,678
so it's abuse of sla services

397
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,600
and of course dedicated infrastructure

398
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,880
because we see a cases when criminals

399
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,240
manage to build

400
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,760
own data centers in the basements

401
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,039
of their own private buildings so

402
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,679
you can see on the right side a

403
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,200
screenshot from the video

404
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,080
from ukrainian security service which

405
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,120
rated

406
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,520
one of such hosting in-house hosting

407
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,000
and you can see four racks of servers in

408
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,320
the private house

409
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,520
so and normally this kind of hostings

410
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,160
abuse a conflict of interest between the

411
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,960
countries

412
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,160
or use locations which are

413
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,120
near conflict zones or local conflict

414
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,679
zones

415
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,640
so several examples where we can spot

416
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
different strategies

417
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,360
in this case on the advertisement we can

418
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,280
see 48

419
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,400
warranty for

420
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,400
dedicated host and in our fin

421
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,039
the warranty is not valid if the owner

422
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,000
of the infrastructure changes password

423
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,039
what means what it's compromised

424
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,720
asset of course

425
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,080
seashells is not a fancy beaches

426
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,120
some companies registered in play in

427
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,320
offshore places like seychelles

428
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,919
while keeping it pools in our countries

429
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,280
like russia ukraine or romania

430
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,120
and this raises really complex

431
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,559
across jurisdictional issues because

432
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,919
law enforcement from many countries

433
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,080
should collaborate to take down those

434
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,840
infrastructures and of course

435
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,120
example of abuse of slas where

436
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,320
people provide

437
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,400
particular locations in the countries

438
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,559
like russia ukraine moldova

439
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,280
or netherlands or malaysia because every

440
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,640
of these countries

441
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,120
are suitable to host particular content

442
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,679
which

443
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,799
hosted by criminals

444
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,840
another short note actually

445
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,240
what happened if country have uh

446
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,280
enforcement

447
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,440
of the rules so for example in russia

448
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,200
roscommon nazor can block

449
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,480
country uh content in the country white

450
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,360
uh scale

451
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,760
based on the court decision so what

452
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,679
means that content will be blocked in

453
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,640
russia but it's

454
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,760
if it's still hosted in russia no

455
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,760
like normal russian customers unable to

456
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,679
access the content

457
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,400
but roscomm nazar doesn't block external

458
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,480
connections so this content will be

459
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,200
available for our countries and

460
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,360
criminals who target in our countries

461
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,559
are able to host some infrastructure in

462
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,159
russia

463
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,600
so to summarize that we built a pretty

464
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,280
big table

465
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,720
which so based on the criminal

466
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,760
actors opinion what are

467
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,400
the countries which which are used to

468
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,760
host particular

469
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,799
content like spam fishing

470
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,760
political content or copyright materials

471
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,559
and you can see

472
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,000
three letters here y means criminals

473
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,320
prefer this location

474
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,360
m means maybe what means some criminals

475
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,480
succeed

476
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,600
to host on this location and

477
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,840
and it's where negative comments uh

478
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,720
feedback from criminals when we try to

479
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,120
host

480
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,959
in these particular locations

481
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,000
so another example of successful hosting

482
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,880
is a fast

483
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,919
looks so fast flux before was

484
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,320
mostly on boats or uncompromising

485
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,240
infrastructures

486
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,799
and now we can see a tendency when

487
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,080
criminals renting

488
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,880
assets from legitimate isps and we're

489
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,600
using pretty big pools to move assets

490
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,200
around so for example here we can see

491
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,480
an advertisement from brazers

492
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,559
which are offered to host content

493
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,480
on fast flux and we are able to

494
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,039
provision

495
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,480
infrastructure in 15 minutes so

496
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,159
how to spot fast flux actually

497
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,480
some of the indicators are visible in

498
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,679
dns records

499
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,799
so some timeouts are way shorter

500
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,080
shortly when default value

501
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,880
for example a refresh timeout could be

502
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,520
just several minutes

503
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,520
and but often a sign of fast looks but

504
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,240
sometimes

505
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,799
uh legitimate big websites using the

506
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,879
same strategy for load balancing

507
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,159
and here is a feedback from criminal

508
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,760
actors

509
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,120
which isps are

510
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,039
suitable to host content with some

511
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,480
sla restrictions so what what's how we

512
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,120
see

513
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,280
uh legitimate isp providers

514
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,720
to for short-term lease

515
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,919
so let's move to some case studies so

516
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,440
first case study

517
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,000
is a fast flux we made several case

518
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,840
studies based on the underground forum

519
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,039
hostings

520
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,080
and here you can see skyfrog forum and

521
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,360
on the year 2016 you can see a huge

522
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:15,919
spike

523
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,120
among the countries and the

524
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,559
huge range of ip addresses up to 400 ip

525
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,559
addresses has been used in particular

526
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,440
countries

527
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,240
so we will we decided to look into this

528
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,840
situation

529
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,360
so we zoom it in and we saw what just

530
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,039
in one year over 300

531
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,000
autonomous systems has been used but in

532
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,039
our years it's

533
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,080
just a couple of dozens so

534
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,520
and uh year 2018 here is not present

535
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,559
probably because all the year

536
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,840
hosting uh this site was

537
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,960
hosted in just one autonomous system and

538
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,640
according to the size of the circle it

539
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,760
will was able to survive over 400

540
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,360
days but if we zoom in more

541
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,200
we can spot a fast flux

542
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,520
pattern which was visible not during the

543
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,559
year but just

544
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,279
nine days uh of september 2016

545
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,120
where this 300 autonomous systems has

546
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,919
been used

547
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,520
by hosting so what's the pattern of

548
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,320
fast flux

549
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,480
so and how to spot different strategies

550
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,520
of hosting here's another example

551
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,919
on black service shop

552
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,840
and we visualize it hosting several ways

553
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,200
so this is a slide

554
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,039
by countries and days active

555
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,000
and this gives us some insights but if

556
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,799
you slice

557
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,000
over autonomous systems for example and

558
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
number of ip used we can see but

559
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,360
in some autonomous systems criminals

560
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,960
able to use just one ip address

561
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,360
and survive just several days in our

562
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,279
autonomous systems

563
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,559
we are able to survive quite long time

564
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,960
and use it over 20 ib addresses

565
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,720
and if we zoom in we can spot what

566
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,120
assets still have to move around

567
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,039
different locations different different

568
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,799
autonomous systems

569
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,159
and that's pretty often sign of sla

570
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,559
appears

571
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,720
so to summarize this um which

572
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,919
criminal holster is more successful

573
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,840
successful it's a questionnaires which

574
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,799
use

575
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,480
fast flux which use virtualization on

576
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,919
the back end

577
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,760
and which short term term rentals

578
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,919
and compromised assets and what's all

579
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,000
depends on the services or target

580
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:10,240
auditory for which we provide services

581
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,679
as an example is yali shanda

582
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,960
who is able to survive very long time

583
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,360
by providing bulletproof services based

584
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,320
on the fast flux

585
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,919
so and to summarize this section so

586
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,320
criminals abuse local laws and

587
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,720
regulations

588
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,919
we clearly adjust uh

589
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,960
victims versus graphical locations of

590
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,320
hostings

591
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,640
and use geopolitical situation

592
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,880
[Music]

593
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,960
between the countries to adjust your

594
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,559
services

595
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,840
of course we abuse slas of legitimate

596
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,480
infrastructures we

597
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,320
building infrastructures where

598
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,520
as that can survive a lifetime

599
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,158
enough time to i would say

600
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,919
commit a crime but which will be faster

601
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,679
when abuse requests and so on

602
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,200
so so the future of

603
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,240
underground hosting we feel that in the

604
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,360
future where will be

605
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,440
three directions so the clustering will

606
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,840
move into the clouds

607
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,520
hosting will move into new devices like

608
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,480
industrial iot equipment and clouds is

609
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,840
because criminals have to formally react

610
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,080
to many abuses and move assets from one

611
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,240
place to another and with clouds it's

612
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,840
easy to move

613
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,679
assets between the countries between

614
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,880
different

615
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,720
between the different uh hosting regions

616
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,600
for iot equipment it's really hard to

617
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,640
investigate

618
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,880
and the third direction we feel it will

619
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,120
be satellite networks

620
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,880
because it's really hard to determine

621
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,240
determine the location of the hosting

622
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,320
and uh kind of alternative networks

623
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,080
so if this we are done thank you very

624
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,720
much

625
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,840
and we are ready to answer your

626
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,000
questions

627
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
you very much i think

628
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,720
all of them there is there is one

629
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,919
question which i would

630
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,720
like to elaborate so uh there is a

631
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,919
question

632
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,440
other countries which are clearly

633
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,559
avoided to host infrastructure

634
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,000
uh of bulletproof so um

635
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
it was to the answer to loan to type

636
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,360
soldiers said

637
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,399
uh you don't see which countries they

638
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,039
tend to avoid bulletproof but you could

639
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,480
see it by campaign

640
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,559
they normally try to avoid the countries

641
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,960
where the most of the victims are

642
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,399
and the reason for this is if victims

643
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,520
are in country a victims can contact

644
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,240
local

645
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,880
law enforcement and if infrastructure is

646
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,799
based in the same country

647
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,360
where the victim is it's very easy for

648
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,360
the infrastructure to be taken down

649
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,679
so the general strategy that we've seen

650
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,880
is to place

651
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,240
uh infrastructure that is being used for

652
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,320
particular criminal campaign

653
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,200
in a different geographical location

654
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,080
preferably

655
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,320
in a location that doesn't have a good

656
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,919
ties with the country

657
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,679
where the most of the victims are so for

658
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,159
example if they target united states

659
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,600
they would not be hosting infrastructure

660
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,120
in the united states if they're

661
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,399
targeting russia

662
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,919
the infrastructure would never be in

663
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,080
russia and so on unless the person is

664
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,799
not very

665
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,520
professional hopefully i answer your

666
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,120
question

667
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,520
cool thank you very much both for for

668
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,440
giving this interesting presentation and

669
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:45,760
talk

670
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,880
i think just gives a good insight um and

671
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,520
with that

672
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,159
we'll close this session and people now

673
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,919
have a few minutes to move on to the

674
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,200
next session

675
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,360
so have a great day and see you in the

676
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,559
next session
