security

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,520

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,040
standard that was published

50
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,920
faster seat belts kathleen will fly us

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,399
through a projected field of security

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,079
and defense

53
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,360
if we embrace those five trends please

54
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,000
don't forget

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,038
to make your question using the q a too

56
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,679
and what is castling the floor is yours

57
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,840
good morning thank you lucy for such a

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,120
nice introduction

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,280
and thank you to first for a wonderful

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,800
conference this week pulling off your

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,200
first

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,760
online conference i look forward to the

63
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,239
sessions later today as well

64
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,920
um it's you know been a rich set of

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,800
talks ranging from you know one similar

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,680
to mine which

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,200
we're concerned with scale how do you

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,120
scale vulnerabilities

69
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,319
uh to stealthy protocols and increases

70
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,080
in encryption

71
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,840
and um you know with that i'm going to

72
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,760
begin my talk on transforming

73
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,080
information security

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,680
how to optimize these five trends that

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,640
i'll discuss

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,599
to enable security for businesses of all

77
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,840
sizes this gives us about a five to ten

78
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,200
year outlook

79
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,680
on what we'll see in terms of security

80
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,800
changing

81
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,879
from observations and

82
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,920
how the defender can better prepare for

83
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,159
it

84
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,159
as well as what they might expect if

85
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,760
these trends are embraced

86
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,319
and if we think about scale because

87
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,159
right now security is not suited to

88
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,760
businesses of all sizes

89
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,319
and it's up to us to make that change so

90
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:26,799
with that

91
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,159
i'm going to pivot and talk a little bit

92
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,680
about the threat landscape which you

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,879
heard a little bit about the threat

94
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,200
landscape this week already

95
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,680
yesterday's keynote gave us insights

96
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,319
into

97
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,239
um google project zero and the 90-day

98
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,519
turnaround time to uh you know how you

99
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,959
handle vulnerabilities

100
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,680
and the disclosure as well as the

101
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,360
remediation part

102
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,319
um so this will tack on to all of that a

103
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,560
bit and you also heard from sisa

104
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,519
who tapped into which i thought was very

105
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,319
interesting

106
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,280
the incident responders cultural norm

107
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,959
and identity

108
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,799
now why i found that interesting is

109
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,640
first you know they were looking at it

110
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,080
from a different angle in

111
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,959
in terms of the cultural norms and

112
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,040
identity and i teach a course on cyber

113
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
threat intelligence at georgetown

114
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,079
and the students dive into the cultural

115
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,720
norms and identities of the attacker

116
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
right so it's a little bit of a

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,320
different angle and

118
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,280
actually using the the same textbook the

119
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,720
uh

120
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,040
cultural oh i don't have the book right

121
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,759
near me

122
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,800
cultural norms and identity

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,320
um uh uh

124
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,440
book um sorry so um adding in the

125
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,240
anecdotes

126
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
through me a little bit but important

127
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,320
nonetheless um

128
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,800
so with that the threat landscape is

129
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,320
changing our threat actors are

130
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,360
increasingly sophisticated they

131
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,759
are organized they are professionals in

132
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,199
some cases they work for

133
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,280
nation states in some cases they're

134
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,440
contractors for nation states

135
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,919
they are sometimes siloed into very

136
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,680
specific roles where they gain high

137
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,120
levels of expertise you might have

138
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
somebody that does the reconnaissance

139
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,080
activities

140
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,400
and does an amazing job of it not just

141
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,680
profiling

142
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,160
the applications in an organization but

143
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,680
even the hardware

144
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,840
and what is the supply chain for that

145
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,560
organization's determining

146
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,800
what's the easiest way to get into that

147
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
organization

148
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,840
is it through the supply chain is there

149
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,600
a direct vulnerability

150
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,280
in one of the applications that they're

151
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,440
aware of that can be exploited

152
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,680
is it a person then you might have

153
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,560
somebody else

154
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,759
in the team that is profiling the people

155
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,240
is there an attack against a person that

156
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,160
could help you gain access

157
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,880
is there a trigger an emotional trigger

158
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,960
one of the behavioral for behavioral

159
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,759
triggers

160
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,560
that might get one of the executives or

161
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,600
an employee

162
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,520
to click on the link and to download

163
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,880
malware

164
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,880
right and then the next level you might

165
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,479
have somebody that takes

166
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,800
this reconnaissance information and

167
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,080
they're focused on

168
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,240
developing zero-day attacks or maybe

169
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,840
they even have one catalog for the

170
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,960
specific

171
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,759
applications in the environment and then

172
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,199
you might have somebody else

173
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,400
who compiles these together so that you

174
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,080
have your entrance

175
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,960
way into the organization and then the

176
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,479
plan in terms of how you're going to

177
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,919
root around to get

178
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,240
towards your objectives and still even

179
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,160
another expert that might be in charge

180
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,080
of command and control

181
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,840
we're talking about a really high level

182
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,759
of sophistication

183
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,759
then depending on the threat actor they

184
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,880
may have very different objectives

185
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,800
what we've learned from cultural norms

186
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,160
and identity over

187
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,280
a span of time even from kinetic to now

188
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,000
cyber and

189
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,599
espionage there are some common patterns

190
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,240
that we see

191
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,919
from various threat actors and of course

192
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,680
those common patterns can change over

193
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,560
time

194
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,400
but if you have intellectual property

195
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,080
that's stolen and it's attributed to

196
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,880
china

197
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,560
you have a pretty high assurance that

198
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,440
that data is going to be used

199
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,360
to increase their technical

200
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,199
technological advantage

201
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,560
and thus your advantage in industry

202
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,479
might then be reduced

203
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,319
if it's russia it might be to sow

204
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,319
discord and that could be for

205
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,039
information warfare

206
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,319
and um it could be for information

207
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,919
warfare it could be

208
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,000
for um even holding a cold war

209
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,199
lever switch right so think about the

210
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,440
attacks against the utilities

211
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,919
and what happened in the the ukraine as

212
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,639
an example

213
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,960
they had their big power outage and then

214
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,400
subsequent to that

215
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,560
other utilities in the us march 2018

216
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,039
us cert had reported on the utilities

217
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,240
being infiltrated

218
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
well we knew that they would act on it

219
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,319
right so that's a cold war lever

220
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,440
switch iran has been

221
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,360
increasingly sophisticated in their

222
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,879
attacks and there's some

223
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,039
cultural norms and identities that have

224
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,599
held true

225
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,400
and um

226
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,039
so there are some culture i'm sorry the

227
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,039
the notes coming in i'll share slides in

228
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,400
just a moment but

229
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,440
i i i'm starting um

230
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,800
in this way um

231
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,240
so the cultural norms and identity

232
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,039
that the cultural norms and identity for

233
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:29,599
iran

234
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,760
hold true from kinetic to cyber in that

235
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,000
there have traditionally been from

236
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,279
a revenge standpoint and there's also

237
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,200
been reuse of tools

238
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,440
and this has been seen from all

239
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
different attack types

240
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,839
from iran and more recently as they

241
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,480
transitioned from focusing on government

242
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,680
and oil and gas

243
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,120
and utilities to finance some of these

244
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,560
themes have held true although the

245
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,480
motive might have been

246
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,080
monetary as well and what i mean by that

247
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,920
in terms of reuse of tools

248
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,959
is to get into the financials

249
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,640
they used um

250
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,720
they used vpn concentrators

251
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,040
in order to they use vpn concentrators

252
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,839
in order to

253
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,200
get into networks and they use day one

254
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
attacks right so you could think of that

255
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,440
in terms of you know mapping to their

256
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,080
expected cultural norms and identity

257
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,519
sew and the revenge piece

258
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,040
all right so i'm going to

259
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,760
begin sharing the slides

260
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,839
so hopefully you can see them

261
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,600
um i am not seeing them though

262
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,839
okay i am very sorry um are you seeing

263
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,560
them not yet

264
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,200
let's try um stop sharing and let's try

265
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,320
that one more time

266
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,360
it seemed to work the other day i'm

267
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,320
sorry it's all right kathleen was trying

268
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,040
to uh

269
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,200
have this be a little bit smooth and i'm

270
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
sorry then the notes have

271
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,279
uh coming there we go thrown me a little

272
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,880
bit um

273
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
okay so in terms of the threat landscape

274
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,959
there's another big piece

275
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,519
is the uh change at every layer of the

276
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,839
protocol

277
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,120
stack i teach another course on

278
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,079
security architecture and design and

279
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,680
with this

280
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,600
there's no textbook right now because

281
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,880
there's so much

282
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,160
change happening the hardware has

283
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,640
changed

284
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,040
memory has changed as you go up the

285
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,480
stack we're seeing more use of

286
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,600
encryption

287
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,440
applications have changed we're moving

288
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,680
to microservices

289
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,120
tied into devsecops processes with zero

290
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,160
trust as as a theme right so additional

291
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,320
isolation between components

292
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,360
these are big changes and it also

293
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,279
presents a really big opportunity

294
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,480
and so with that opportunity i want to

295
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,160
talk a little bit about

296
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,720
what protection looks like today before

297
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,920
diving into the trends

298
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,000
each organization has teams of people

299
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,440
who manage all the various technologies

300
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,959
deployed on your network and you need

301
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,399
all these technologies

302
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,240
because of how we've architected systems

303
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,600
to date

304
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,279
might be a firewall an intrusion

305
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,800
protection system

306
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,040
you might have dns black holing which

307
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,560
might be on your internal network or you

308
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,839
might have outsourced that through a

309
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,680
provider

310
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,519
deep packet inspection you might even

311
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,040
have web filtering

312
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,360
and you likely have a sim tool that

313
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,279
shares data into a governance risk and

314
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,880
compliance system

315
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,279
and that governance risk and compliance

316
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,079
system

317
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,000
normalizes data and bubbles them up so

318
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,519
you know your biggest risks in your

319
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,399
organization

320
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,600
align to the priorities for the business

321
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,839
and then you get to threat intelligence

322
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,040
and as you all know

323
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,639
that's pretty messy right now and

324
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,320
resource intensive

325
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,720
large organizations have as much as

326
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,160
eight different threat feeds that come

327
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,600
in because they're afraid to miss

328
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,639
one particular ioc that comes in that

329
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,399
could tip them off on an attack in their

330
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,680
network

331
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,000
that's a big burden then on top of that

332
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,040
they may also be in

333
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,160
sharing groups and it's not just pulling

334
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,839
the data out of the sharing group that's

335
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,480
useful

336
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,800
but you're expected to share back in so

337
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,079
you have to have a high level of

338
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,600
expertise in your organization to

339
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,720
participate

340
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,880
right to have a seat at the table and

341
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
then once you have this data

342
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,959
oftentimes you're applying it manually

343
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,720
to your environment to figure out

344
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,440
how do you best deploy these tools and

345
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,120
if you're not doing it manually

346
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,560
you might have scripted something

347
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,399
internally so you had an expert that was

348
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,040
able to do that

349
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,240
then this has to happen at every single

350
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,920
organization because of our current

351
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,959
architectures this is why we have

352
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,920
a 3.5 million person deficit for

353
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,680
security professionals globally

354
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,680
and that's something that's bothered me

355
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,360
a lot so as lucy mentioned i read

356
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,040
i don't know it was 400 pages every

357
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,720
other week for four years

358
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,639
and it wasn't just for security it was

359
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,880
across the internet protocol stack

360
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,800
and with that i was able to make a lot

361
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,880
of observations in terms of trends that

362
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,399
were happening in industry

363
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,399
and also paying attention to what

364
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,320
companies were doing what which gives

365
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,000
you additional insight

366
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,839
another piece is that i worked on a

367
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,040
draft now publication rfc 8404 with al

368
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,079
morton

369
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,440
and that was really enlightening

370
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,720
essentially it the title of it is um

371
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,040
observations on pervasive uh the

372
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,839
the effectiveness of oh sorry the the

373
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,320
effect

374
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,199
of pervasive monitoring on operators

375
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,320
right so

376
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,639
we gathered information from all

377
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,519
different operators

378
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,720
including information security internal

379
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,800
isp or service provider level

380
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,199
operators as well to see what happens

381
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,920
when we have high levels of encryption

382
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,120
on the network

383
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,360
what are they using or what were they

384
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,720
using then

385
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,240
and how will they be impacted

386
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,160
when those functions go away now we

387
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,000
didn't put in the paper

388
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,920
what the impact would be but those

389
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,360
discussions happened

390
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,160
the paper was merely to document what

391
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,920
are the current practices so that we can

392
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,560
figure out

393
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,040
how do we go forward but not in that

394
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,639
document

395
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,720
that got me thinking so strong

396
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,000
encryption i'm going to run through the

397
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,720
trends

398
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,560
this is a very big trend that we're all

399
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
seeing uh you know quite a bit

400
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,600
with the release of tls 1.3

401
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,839
we have strong encryption and we're

402
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,360
seeing this used heavily just on

403
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,160
internet connections today you've had a

404
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,760
few big changes in terms of your

405
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,639
visibility

406
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,519
as a responder or a defender you don't

407
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,760
see the certificate anymore

408
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,240
and that was often used for detection

409
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,519
capabilities to know

410
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,360
which site were you really going to

411
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,279
because sni may or may not have been

412
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,560
accurate

413
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,839
and sni is the server name indicator

414
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,880
with this information hidden you have

415
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,160
less insight

416
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,120
then there's the quick protocol and

417
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,519
quick

418
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,959
uses tls 1.3 and udp as a substrate

419
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,320
so what does that mean you have that

420
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,279
loss of visibility but on top of that

421
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,399
quick has no signal no

422
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,560
signaling information visible except for

423
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,519
one bit

424
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,480
for passive measurement this is a big

425
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:54,800
hit

426
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,759
in terms of what you see on the wire and

427
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,440
it had been adopted by google and it was

428
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,199
used opportunistically

429
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,120
if it passed through a firewall quick

430
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,720
would function

431
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,320
now we're seeing it get picked up by

432
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,079
microsoft and other

433
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,720
vendors and so you'll see use of this

434
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,279
protocol

435
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,079
in more than just internet settings it's

436
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,680
going to be moving into internal

437
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,560
networks

438
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,480
which will force some changes in terms

439
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,320
of where do you have visibility in

440
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,240
your internal network and how do you

441
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,320
manage it efficiently

442
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,480
ubiquitous encryption encryption's

443
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,839
everywhere we saw

444
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,040
really big changes from 2013 to today

445
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,279
with web encryption on the internet

446
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,279
there was a jump from 30

447
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,199
to about 90 percent and you can see this

448
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,759
on the let's encrypt stats

449
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,600
this is interesting it's not just

450
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,240
because of snowden that was the initial

451
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,360
motive however what the big

452
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,120
change in my opinion was and what

453
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,279
enabled it was the automated certificate

454
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,000
management and environment protocol

455
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,560
that is essentially a protocol that

456
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,959
allows you to manage your certificates

457
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,800
so if a certificate is about to expire

458
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,480
it automatically updates you don't need

459
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,079
a person in there doing cut and paste

460
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,000
operations anymore

461
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,839
this is a really important change and

462
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,039
something you should think about for

463
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,640
your internal networks

464
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,480
if you're moving to use of tls

465
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,839
more more fully on your internal

466
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,160
networks that was allowed to go through

467
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,679
because people who were blocking that

468
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,039
type of

469
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,839
progression in the past were more open

470
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,400
to

471
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,440
less than perfect security in favor of

472
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,760
ease of use and manageability

473
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,880
that was a really big change and it has

474
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,280
had

475
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,480
just a tremendous impact zero trust

476
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,400
or data centric i'll go into that a

477
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,000
little bit more in a subsequent slide

478
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,240
but not really for the zero trust aspect

479
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,280
itself

480
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,679
but for how we deploy it how we think

481
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,520
about the management

482
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,880
of this new architecture because we have

483
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,039
to think about patterns that scale so we

484
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,120
get away from that last slide

485
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,959
where we had these

486
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,480
where we had you know just really

487
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,039
difficult

488
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,880
and have difficult management patterns

489
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,960
that have high level of resource

490
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,559
requirements

491
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,200
protocol stack evolution this is one

492
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,440
that may or may not be on your radar

493
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,960
but with the with the

494
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,320
um push for strong encryption network

495
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,000
engineers aren't seeing what they used

496
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,280
to see on the network

497
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,520
and this matters more from our work on 8

498
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,480
404 on

499
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,039
internal networks than external internet

500
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,160
face connections

501
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,080
because the service provider operators

502
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,840
typically only look at the

503
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,880
header information from the tcp

504
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,559
and ip levels but this protocol stack

505
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,679
evolution

506
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,360
means we're going to start seeing more

507
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,799
ipv6

508
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,160
that's something you should think about

509
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,000
in terms of initiating your journey as

510
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,760
you embrace these trends

511
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,440
ipv4 doesn't give you extra visibility

512
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,679
ipv6 adds a few things that might be

513
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,559
important

514
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,400
it gives you the ability to tag a

515
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,919
session for troubleshooting so you can

516
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,600
trace it across the network with a flow

517
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,400
label

518
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,480
it also gives you the ability to use

519
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,799
extension headers and the extension

520
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,559
headers could let you do things like

521
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,799
calculate round trip times not just for

522
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,720
the packet itself end to end

523
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,039
but also for the server round trip time

524
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,440
so there are some important capabilities

525
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,960
that will be added back

526
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,039
if you're using ipv6 so this is a

527
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,720
consideration for you

528
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,160
another one in the protocol stack

529
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
evolution is the use of routing overlay

530
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,360
protocols

531
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,360
and you can also add in these

532
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,840
measurements with routing overlay

533
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,320
protocols

534
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,840
but another thing you can do is set the

535
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,480
logical path of a packet so where does

536
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,240
this packet go on your network

537
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,160
it may not follow the physical path it

538
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,960
may follow the logical path

539
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,600
data ownership this is a big one that

540
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,000
will

541
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,760
guide some of your capabilities

542
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,240
customers are interested in making sure

543
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,440
end users

544
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,360
that they own their data that they

545
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,799
manage their data

546
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,400
now you probably hear about this and

547
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,320
news articles more related to social

548
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,039
media

549
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,520
but think about it from in terms of

550
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,039
outsourcing your data to a cloud

551
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:13,840
provider

552
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,080
cloud providers have moved towards

553
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,240
capabilities where customers can manage

554
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,000
their own keys to data

555
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and that means the club provider no

556
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,760
longer has access to the data

557
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,120
what does this do if a warrant is served

558
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,919
to access data to the cloud provider

559
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,919
they don't have a way to give that over

560
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,000
so that warrant has to go to the data

561
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,400
owner

562
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,600
in order to to serve that and gain

563
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,520
access to the data because they hold the

564
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,880
keys

565
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,080
so that is another big change now that

566
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,760
means that data is encrypted at the

567
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,039
object level not just

568
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,240
transport and so with that we're going

569
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,240
to see bigger changes where

570
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,480
data is encrypted on the system at all

571
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,280
times

572
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,200
except maybe while in secure isolated

573
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,120
execution in a trusted execution

574
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,240
environment

575
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,720
and even even in that case there's a lot

576
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,480
of work happening to see well can we do

577
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,440
mpc multi-party computation

578
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,840
in that trusted execution environment so

579
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,960
it stays encrypted

580
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,000
even at that point so as you think about

581
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,760
these trends how do you embrace them

582
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,559
today

583
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,559
and i'll talk about what it might look

584
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,919
like in the future

585
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,240
trusted controls what are your trusted

586
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,200
controls

587
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,159
how are they implemented that is a

588
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,840
strong consideration another

589
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,280
is having an endpoint focus

590
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,480
right you're going to have your

591
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,320
visibility capabilities and your

592
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,760
management capabilities

593
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,520
at the end point do what you can now at

594
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,400
the end point

595
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,280
and in time this should move towards

596
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,960
vendor focus where the vendor is

597
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,640
providing a lot of controls and i'll get

598
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,799
into that to a few slides

599
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,640
encryption management i touched on that

600
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,360
already ipv6 and xerotrust will go on to

601
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,719
that in another slide

602
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,840
so embrace these trends it will be

603
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,520
disruptive because there are a lot of

604
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,720
boxes in the middle

605
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,440
that will go away and we'll move towards

606
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
built-in or intrinsic security

607
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,400
we're seeing this already today if you

608
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,600
think about it

609
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,360
our operating systems have become

610
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,600
slimmed down we've seen

611
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
separation from the operating system and

612
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
application with microsoft moving a lot

613
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,240
of their services to the cloud

614
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,840
with this you have a smaller attack

615
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,159
surface on your operating system

616
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,640
and you're beginning to see more

617
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,760
segregation

618
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,320
so that you have more discrete parts to

619
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,159
manage in terms of security which fits

620
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,480
into devsecops processes

621
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,840
and the use of microservices these are

622
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,520
big changes

623
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,919
with zero trust you're having validation

624
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,080
at each of those levels

625
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,679
and with that you can have trusted

626
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,000
assurance but the one thing we really

627
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,840
have to think about is architectural

628
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,520
patterns that scale

629
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,159
and to deploy those so i'm going to dive

630
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,080
into xero trust as an example as an

631
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,280
architectural pattern that scales

632
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,840
ten years ago forester came out with

633
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,720
zero trust

634
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,360
and it was network focused where you

635
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,440
were segregating one application

636
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,840
or another app from another application

637
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,400
if an attacker got into the application

638
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,480
they're less likely to move laterally

639
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,240
and get into another application

640
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,559
in your network so you're limiting your

641
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,600
damage

642
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,720
but in the last 10 years we've seen

643
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,880
a lot of change now depending on where

644
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,480
you look for your information on xero

645
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:32,880
trust

646
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,120
my recommendation is to go to nist 800

647
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,360
zero trust architectures as a more

648
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,880
official source

649
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,640
and the reason for that is it's vendor

650
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,120
neutral and it's all encompassing

651
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,039
zero trust has really moved to be

652
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,440
pervasive throughout the stack

653
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,520
from boot all the way up to your

654
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,039
applications

655
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,720
where we have this focus on securing

656
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
at the component level so where in the

657
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,039
past we thought about applications

658
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,520
with encryption strong authentication

659
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,679
verified controls

660
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,520
authentication could be between a device

661
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,960
or user you have transaction logs which

662
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,760
we as

663
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,600
incident responders defenders even

664
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,880
security professionals

665
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,760
love right the more data the better and

666
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,279
you have isolation

667
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,279
but this is now at a component level or

668
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,880
a microservice level

669
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,480
and so you're getting this assurance and

670
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,559
verification which might be done through

671
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,760
attestation or some other technology

672
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,360
you know i think longer term it will be

673
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,279
attestation

674
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,320
and so one individual component verifies

675
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,279
to the next

676
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,960
and if you think about this within an

677
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,559
application at uh

678
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,240
you know using microservices or

679
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
devsecops process

680
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,840
we're getting more granular and we can

681
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,960
put more controls in interesting places

682
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,080
now to give a good example from boot we

683
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,159
have this pretty well in place with

684
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,400
i think most vendors now implement it

685
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,440
slightly differently

686
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,360
so the traditionals like dell hp ibm

687
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,559
they have the trusted platform module

688
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,320
and they're following the tcg the

689
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,400
trusted computing group standards

690
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,559
where first they have a certificate that

691
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,520
says what hardware is

692
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,440
expected on my system that's verified

693
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,320
and you now know that what's expected in

694
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,000
terms of hardware on your system is

695
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,720
matched

696
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,559
before your firmware process can kick

697
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,880
off right so you have that verification

698
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,799
between these these processes and

699
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,919
components

700
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,880
next when the firmware boots it is going

701
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,200
to

702
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,799
adhere to nist 800 193 standards for

703
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,760
firmware

704
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,360
now this is an important thing which

705
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,679
actually the hyperscalers follow

706
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,760
this with you know open titan and

707
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,120
aws is nitro right so there's there's

708
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,679
themes around following the same sets of

709
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,240
standards and trusted controls

710
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,039
now with the tcg and the traditionals

711
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:57,440
they

712
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,600
went a step further and they took this

713
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,320
800 193 document and further specified

714
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,640
the control sets

715
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,120
in the reference integrity measurements

716
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,840
and so

717
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,679
as the firmware is booting there are

718
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,360
configuration measurements

719
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,440
configuration policy settings and

720
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,640
measurements

721
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,880
that are verified to make sure they are

722
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,880
as expected if they're not

723
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,279
there's resiliency built in a process

724
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,440
can be restarted to ensure the integrity

725
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,039
of the system at boot so you have a

726
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,880
trusted system

727
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,520
now as you go up the stack this

728
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
attestation capability can happen on

729
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,200
containers and is already present from

730
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,960
several vendors

731
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,520
you can do it for applications and so

732
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,159
we're really walking down this this path

733
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,400
of of zero trust and building in

734
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,279
security

735
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,000
but how do we do it at scale one of the

736
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,600
key pieces here is

737
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,400
the vendor implemented it and there's

738
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,600
logs behind

739
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,960
so that the distributed

740
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,200
organizations have access to the logs so

741
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,880
they have the capability to audit and

742
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,919
verify

743
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,000
however they don't have to do the

744
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,760
configuration piece

745
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,919
they don't have to have an expert on

746
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,640
staff that's capable of doing that

747
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,440
and so thinking in terms of how do we

748
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,640
deploy

749
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,159
trusted controls in ways that matter and

750
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,679
building in security

751
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,520
will make a large impact not just for

752
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,360
your organization if you're medium or

753
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:21,919
small

754
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,080
but if you're large to your suppliers in

755
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,000
your supply chain

756
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,240
so how does zero trust help well if you

757
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,399
think about the kill chain and and

758
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,399
you know even the miter attack framework

759
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,520
but for this

760
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,919
the simpler kill chain is is fine just

761
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,919
to serve as an example

762
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,200
when i walk through the zero trust

763
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,120
tenants these really help

764
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,840
for your detection capabilities across

765
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,960
the kill chain

766
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,320
you know for reconnaissance you're gonna

767
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,159
have more data for

768
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,320
um attempts at delivery and exploitation

769
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,799
you're going to see attempts you know

770
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,039
within modules and you'll see more flags

771
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,120
and unusual behavior

772
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,360
or even more activity because of the

773
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,200
level of logging because of the level of

774
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
verification

775
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,159
another piece to zero trust i didn't

776
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,320
mention is the dynamic

777
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,279
piece once you're authenticated you're

778
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,600
not authenticated for all time

779
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,799
you have to um

780
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,120
you have to re-authenticate and so as an

781
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,039
attacker you have to survive

782
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,720
the re-authentication process

783
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,880
so with that it's more difficult

784
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,000
and we've seen in the timeline that

785
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,559
the kill chain began and zero trust was

786
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,039
about the same about ten years ago

787
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,600
and with these changes that really go

788
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,840
hand in hand and complement each other

789
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,799
we've gone from dwell times of two and a

790
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,720
half years i remember sitting in rooms

791
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,840
and hearing about

792
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,080
you know dwell times in in networks of

793
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,600
two and a half years where the attacker

794
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,840
just sat there unnoticed

795
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,440
to 56 days as a median

796
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,760
in the m trends report from last year

797
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,480
these are big

798
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,880
changes and you know we've we've had the

799
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,520
data to really flag this

800
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,399
now what we have to really focus on is

801
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,000
architectural patterns that

802
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,120
scale as we continue down this path so

803
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,240
we have to think about

804
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,679
built-in security and and how we

805
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,320
push our vendors to do that more and if

806
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,039
you go back

807
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,240
to rsa 2018 i believe it was

808
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,440
vmware got out there and really started

809
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,120
to push other vendors to think about

810
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,799
built-in security

811
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,880
and two years later when they reported

812
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,399
out they said they

813
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,440
cut in half the number of security

814
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,279
services that were available on their

815
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,159
platform

816
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,679
which meant it was easier for their

817
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,279
customers to manage it

818
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,120
but we can do better we can build an

819
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,039
attestation capabilities

820
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,799
we can think about things like the

821
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,520
manufacturer usage description

822
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,600
in terms of building in patterns that

823
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,520
scale i'm going to dive into the

824
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,520
manufacturer usage description in case

825
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,960
you're not familiar

826
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,159
because it's a great example and

827
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,640
could grow to be used at a microservice

828
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,360
level

829
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,440
or for smaller components not really for

830
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,600
applications because they're too complex

831
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,360
in some cases

832
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,600
or even for servers which you know are

833
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,880
too complex as well

834
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,840
so the manufacturer usage description is

835
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,240
an ietf standard that's used in the iot

836
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,880
space

837
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,679
and it was born out of the ddos attacks

838
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:24,320
that

839
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,200
um it was dying that was hit with

840
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,640
several years back

841
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,679
and the motivation was preventing

842
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,840
behaviors that were unexpected

843
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,279
but also doing this at scale

844
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,440
so it also has this pattern of a small

845
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,559
number of experts

846
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,159
having a very large impact with that

847
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,200
the the um

848
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,559
the analysts create a set of behaviors

849
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,960
known behaviors that are expected

850
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,080
on a device and since iot devices are

851
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,919
small it's easier to profile

852
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,679
so you have an allow list approach

853
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,720
and only those are allowed or there is

854
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,799
an option to alert as well right which

855
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,880
is common to just alert on something

856
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,080
if you're not ready to fill out block

857
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,080
now this scales because you have a very

858
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,519
small number of analysts

859
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,760
who are able to put out a file if

860
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,880
there's a change

861
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,279
and it updates to all of the devices out

862
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,399
there

863
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,279
another part of this is if we think

864
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,559
about

865
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,720
the history of security we've always

866
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,799
moved from a denialist approach

867
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,120
to eventually an allow list approach and

868
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,360
that's because it scales better

869
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
firewalls began this way right people

870
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,840
were configuring denialist approaches

871
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,600
and then we realized oh that's really

872
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,799
not smart

873
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,880
antivirus you know we've seen how that's

874
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,240
evolved

875
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,000
and now we have indicators of compromise

876
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,480
and indicators of behavior

877
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,799
and that's not scaling well either what

878
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,320
if we think about

879
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,039
how can we profile behaviors on the

880
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,480
positive side

881
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,559
can we do it at a micro service level

882
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,360
can we do this in a way where it scales

883
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,279
so that you know we're making this

884
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,120
transition and we're making it

885
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,240
accessible to organizations of all sizes

886
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
now as a defender there's going to be

887
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,760
plenty of work because remember we have

888
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,720
a 3.5 million person deficit

889
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
that's not going to go away so functions

890
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,080
will shift

891
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,080
but being part of the solution and

892
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,919
embracing these changes

893
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,159
and even driving some of your own will

894
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,000
lead to new opportunities

895
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,720
and will help in the long run to better

896
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,679
secure

897
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,760
our networks intrinsic governance risk

898
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,840
and compliance so what if this stuff all

899
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,880
worked

900
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,480
i know a lot of you are on the defense

901
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,320
side and there's probably some of you

902
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,760
that are on the side of

903
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,200
you know managing the security of

904
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,039
networks as well

905
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,519
but this attestation information fills

906
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,600
in at the bottom layer of this chart

907
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,200
where we have the control validation

908
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,039
evidence

909
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,000
if this were all working and we had a

910
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,159
remote attestation where the data was

911
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,840
fed into central systems

912
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,240
aggregated and then digested in terms of

913
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,000
you know how does this map to your

914
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,159
control frameworks and your standards

915
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,399
how does it map to prioritize lists of

916
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,679
controls

917
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,919
what are my business processes process

918
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:18,960
slas

919
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,039
security level agreements guidelines

920
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,640
reports incidents

921
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,720
how does that fold up to an executive

922
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,960
level what are the business objectives

923
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,559
what are my priorities what do i go

924
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,519
after

925
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,399
how does my security budget and my

926
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,799
incident response and handling budget

927
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,799
get impacted in terms of you know what's

928
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,080
my three-year budget plan

929
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,399
to remediate some of these these pieces

930
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,360
so this is an important consideration to

931
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,960
achieve that

932
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,600
top level grc dashboard in an automated

933
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,480
way

934
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,320
and some of the ways that you can do

935
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,600
this is

936
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,200
through the attestation capabilities

937
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,039
where we can hopefully move to a point

938
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,559
where it just works

939
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,240
now i'll just touch on what happens

940
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,440
today if any of you are using scap

941
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,120
the security content automation

942
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,799
protocols on your network

943
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,199
or the network endpoint assessment

944
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,639
protocols nia

945
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,800
you have really skilled resources these

946
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,560
are not easy to use they are

947
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,199
difficult to manage and they also

948
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:17,760
require

949
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,280
experts on site so switching over

950
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,560
eventually to attestation is one switch

951
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,839
that could help us to better embrace

952
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,839
these trends but also move to patterns

953
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,199
that scale

954
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,639
and i mentioned there are some things

955
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,040
you can do to begin your journey

956
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,918
the center for internet security has

957
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,040
their cyber security

958
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,520
best practices where tons of work has

959
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,280
gone into this over

960
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,280
i think basically my whole career and

961
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,320
uh one piece of that that you can begin

962
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,119
today

963
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,800
whether or not you have attestation is

964
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,960
to think about you know how do i deploy

965
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,119
the cis benchmarks

966
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,640
what are the benchmarks now for me

967
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,560
i remember going back and downloading

968
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,079
off the nsa site

969
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,880
the hardening guide for windows or linux

970
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,440
and then

971
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,599
hardening systems creating an image for

972
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,800
the environment

973
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,480
and pushing that out to all of the

974
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,160
systems so we had a standard image

975
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,200
deployed

976
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,160
well those hardening guidelines are the

977
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,640
cis benchmarks

978
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,640
there are now over 100 benchmarks

979
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,880
they're not limited just to

980
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,520
the operating system they're for server

981
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,440
software for applications

982
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,240
network devices and they're also

983
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,160
recognized by industry frameworks so

984
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,200
what does that mean

985
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,280
there's direct direct mappings of these

986
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,280
controls into the frameworks

987
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,839
if you're doing governance risk and

988
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,240
compliance

989
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,160
now the cis controls are also

990
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,119
very interesting and can help you to

991
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,599
prioritize

992
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,280
how you implement controls on your

993
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,119
network

994
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,440
these align directly to each of the

995
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,280
major frameworks and by frameworks i

996
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,599
mean

997
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,680
this cyber security framework iso 27001

998
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,040
you know this is an international

999
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,480
audience so we may see a little bit more

1000
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,079
of 27 0001

1001
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,000
in use as well as nist 853 the fisma

1002
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,119
controls what these do is they give you

1003
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,720
a prioritization

1004
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,960
they're not the full set of controls but

1005
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,480
they give you a way

1006
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,359
to pick out what are the biggest risks

1007
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,800
for my environment

1008
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,079
and how do i deploy those so it's very

1009
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,359
prescriptive it gives you

1010
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,599
guidance in terms of how do you address

1011
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,720
the biggest threats

1012
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,560
and with the last release 7.1

1013
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,200
our team at cis moved to doing

1014
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,000
implementation

1015
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,119
groups not only that

1016
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,960
they mapped the implementation groups

1017
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,359
against the mitre attack framework

1018
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,119
and then into the verizon data breach

1019
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,640
report

1020
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,200
so what did that tell them well or what

1021
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,560
did that tell us

1022
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,839
with the implementation group one

1023
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,720
you address the five biggest threats and

1024
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,119
it's

1025
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,400
something like 80 percent of

1026
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,040
of a gain in terms of reducing your risk

1027
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,320
posture

1028
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,880
then if you were interested in moving up

1029
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,599
the stack

1030
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,240
and further reducing your risk you'd

1031
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,000
move to implementation group two

1032
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,200
and this of course depends on your

1033
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,560
business risk tolerance and what's

1034
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,920
important to your business but you're

1035
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,640
cutting out a

1036
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,079
really large portion of the risks to

1037
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,119
your network

1038
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,160
by implementing implementation group one

1039
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,320
and it's validated through trusted

1040
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,520
resources right

1041
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,560
so we've come a long way there and this

1042
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,280
is a

1043
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,280
really positive step that you can make

1044
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,960
so if you're doing this on your own

1045
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,400
network

1046
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,000
you can implement these or if you're a

1047
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,680
vendor you can bake these

1048
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,119
in to your products so that

1049
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,480
it's done for the customer

1050
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,040
now with all of these changes what does

1051
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,200
security and detection look like in five

1052
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,000
to ten years

1053
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,760
well we moved to device system level

1054
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,119
built-in security and of course we'll

1055
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,040
have legacy systems so this is you know

1056
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,560
painting a really nice picture

1057
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,560
of some of the key resources

1058
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,119
hopefully we'll move to supply chain and

1059
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,880
software assurance we had a talk this

1060
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,599
week on

1061
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,240
s-bomb the security bill of materials

1062
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,160
and there's some work going there to

1063
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,359
going on there through the ncia to

1064
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,960
build in controls for your supply chain

1065
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,359
so that you have an assurance level

1066
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,280
attestation from a route of trust and

1067
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,960
remote attestation this should give you

1068
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,720
capabilities to shift

1069
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,000
security to that built-in piece from the

1070
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,520
vendor and the vendor might do something

1071
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,680
along the lines of implementation groups

1072
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,119
where a customer can select the

1073
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,200
implementation group but the

1074
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,480
burden on the customer is much less now

1075
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,079
right they're just getting these

1076
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,520
controls they're implemented they're

1077
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,359
getting the evidence their auditors can

1078
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:56,160
see it

1079
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,320
it's a really big change behavioral

1080
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,520
allow lists

1081
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,520
so moving from that denialist approach

1082
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,079
to an allow list approach is another big

1083
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,920
change that we should push for

1084
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,440
in terms of scalability customer owned

1085
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,560
keys for

1086
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,960
encryption and secure execution for

1087
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,079
sensitive data

1088
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,240
this changes what we see those two

1089
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,359
things are happening

1090
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,960
which means we really have to think

1091
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,920
about how do we secure the endpoint

1092
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,640
how do we build in security and then how

1093
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,000
do we use the data

1094
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,440
and all this additional logging

1095
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,320
information as

1096
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,760
responders so aiml it might start

1097
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,640
looking for

1098
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,000
variances within expected measurements

1099
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,160
or policy configuration levels

1100
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,520
you know if you're an attacker you have

1101
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,760
to think ahead you put these controls in

1102
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,040
place they're not just going to do

1103
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,920
variances

1104
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,920
outside of the bounds they're going to

1105
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,359
try to figure out what are the bounds

1106
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,200
that i should stay within so i remain

1107
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,640
undetected

1108
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,960
and that might be a place where aiml

1109
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,880
really fits in fingerprinting i'm sure

1110
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,720
that will continue to be used

1111
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,200
iocs and iobs i'm not sure where they

1112
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,040
fit in

1113
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,400
you know they likely will have a

1114
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,720
continued place

1115
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,560
but we have to think about scale and how

1116
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,319
do we manage that better and

1117
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,839
you know that's one of the motivations

1118
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,839
for this talk is to get each of you

1119
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,839
to think about patterns that scale how

1120
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:16,960
do we revamp this

1121
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,119
how do we move to architectural patterns

1122
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,400
at scale

1123
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,560
on the internet level we'll have some

1124
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,160
great capabilities

1125
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,880
still dns it's not going away even

1126
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,680
though we have

1127
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,599
do dns over https and we also have dot

1128
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,160
dns

1129
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,359
over tls we still have visibility

1130
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,160
at the point of the dns server where

1131
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,599
those translation occurs

1132
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,200
there's a talk later today from paul

1133
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,560
vixi that's probably going to dive

1134
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,920
deeper into dough

1135
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,119
and some of the things you'll have to

1136
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,280
think about on your own network as dough

1137
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,720
is getting deployed

1138
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,319
is that it's configured at an

1139
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,760
application level per

1140
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,920
application level whereas traditional

1141
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,960
dns as well as dns or tls

1142
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,920
is at the operating system level so

1143
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,599
these are some big changes and dough

1144
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,200
directs your

1145
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,960
requests out to specific dns servers

1146
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,800
and so do you have that as a control

1147
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,240
point do you have an agreement with a

1148
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,839
doe provider what is their

1149
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,880
con what is their policies in place

1150
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,720
are they helping you with any screening

1151
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,880
that you've done with dns in the past or

1152
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,240
not so

1153
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,560
in time we will have options for this

1154
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,680
because it's

1155
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,400
you know right now we have the major

1156
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,280
browsers

1157
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,160
have doe implementations and dose

1158
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,680
servers

1159
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,359
but we're also starting to see service

1160
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,800
providers deploy this so i think we'll

1161
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,880
see a range of options in time

1162
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,040
in terms of what your dope provider does

1163
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,240
for you

1164
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,920
fingerprinting you know we need that for

1165
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,440
ddos protection i don't see that

1166
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,319
changing anytime

1167
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,599
soon ipv6 and routing overlay protocols

1168
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,480
will give you good

1169
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,520
dial and capabilities to trace sessions

1170
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,680
and to get some additional information

1171
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,760
that you're used to getting so these are

1172
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,160
important transitions other internet

1173
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,079
level services there was a talk this

1174
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:00,480
week

1175
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,319
on stealthy protocols and so

1176
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,079
you know we have several where we have

1177
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,760
these

1178
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,359
several protocols where we have these

1179
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,960
intermediary points where

1180
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,480
tls is just between the servers so dns

1181
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,240
instant messaging those are examples in

1182
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,839
addition to

1183
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,520
um you know some of the ones mentioned

1184
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,359
already and so those are points of

1185
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,560
visibility as well

1186
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,359
you know with email even if your email

1187
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,040
is encrypted with s mime you still have

1188
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,960
some header information available

1189
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,880
as well as the message transport

1190
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,240
information

1191
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,520
so there's still some level of

1192
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,119
capability that can happen on the

1193
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,599
internet

1194
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,680
and so with that i hope you're inspired

1195
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,839
to think about architectural patterns

1196
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,839
that scale

1197
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,319
so i'd like to take any questions at

1198
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,880
this point

1199
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,400
[Music]

1200
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,400
yeah i'm sorry about my um my slip-ups

1201
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,079
in the beginning the notes coming in

1202
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,359
threw me off oh yeah

1203
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,800
sorry for that i also got distracted

1204
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,720
but another message that already here so

1205
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,640
uh i have one question they have to have

1206
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,319
joe and one of the

1207
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,480
the it was interesting because one of

1208
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,920
the questions the person

1209
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,319
was asking kind of uh where are the

1210
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,240
links between this and then she

1211
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,520
said uh sure here i'm not sure oh

1212
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,440
it's there i would have never i never

1213
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,720
realized that before

1214
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,680
please remember my question so let's go

1215
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,800
i have a question from

1216
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,839
juan uh what would you recommend

1217
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,560
to a company that uh has its cyber

1218
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,280
all spread out around legacy apartments

1219
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,520
and it's trying to put things in order

1220
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,720
by aiming at

1221
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,079
nist csf instead of cis controls

1222
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,200
csf control well i mean

1223
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,800
so going after a set of controls and

1224
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,599
remaining consistent is important

1225
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,640
right and so you know continue down that

1226
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,440
journey

1227
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,599
um push for built-in security when

1228
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,200
you're working with your vendor so even

1229
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,200
when you have your resources distributed

1230
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,560
across

1231
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,119
in multiple departments coordination

1232
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:15,920
would be good

1233
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,800
and start you know looking to see how

1234
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,440
you can do

1235
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,160
built-in security and think about you

1236
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,800
know this transition to the end point

1237
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,520
this one's coming pretty quick with the

1238
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,359
you know onslaught of protocols in some

1239
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,200
cases you can control it in some cases

1240
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,880
you can't you know i was surprised a few

1241
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,800
months ago when a colleague

1242
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,200
approached our team and said oh we're

1243
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,359
starting to see quick more now

1244
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,760
this is a big change and so you know the

1245
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,960
the two of us had a call

1246
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,319
so i could you know walk through some of

1247
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,240
the implications of that

1248
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,319
and i wasn't aware so it was you know

1249
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,280
was lucky

1250
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,040
where i was sitting in an ecosystems

1251
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,400
team and

1252
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,720
you know this expert saw this big trend

1253
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,000
happening

1254
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,640
and so the push to the end point i think

1255
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,560
will be a little faster than even i was

1256
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,599
expecting

1257
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,319
and so getting those controls in place

1258
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,440
thinking about how we

1259
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,160
shore up and harden our endpoints and

1260
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,200
drive after

1261
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,200
the the biggest threats is really

1262
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,319
important but also asking our vendors

1263
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,520
can they do better for us so as hard as

1264
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,960
this and i'm happy to talk to

1265
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,880
uh the person asking the question

1266
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,079
offline

1267
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,160
um you know try figuring out how you

1268
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,839
work better across teams

1269
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,800
i've had to do that in the past um you

1270
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,800
know when i first started

1271
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,400
i guess it wasn't my first job but when

1272
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,160
i was head of security at mit lincoln

1273
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,680
laboratory

1274
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,560
i would go and have coffee every day

1275
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,440
with the

1276
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,560
server lead and the network lead

1277
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,040
and it was very social and we just

1278
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,800
developed good relationships

1279
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,400
and it helped tremendously when we were

1280
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,839
dealing with an incident

1281
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,599
because it's across all teams right you

1282
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,280
have to pull in all these teams together

1283
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,560
thank you we have another question now

1284
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,960
from cultural

1285
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,079
how should cesar teams prepare for the

1286
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,760
transformation in the information

1287
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,880
security environment

1288
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,000
okay well i think it depends on sea

1289
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,160
certs right and having attended first in

1290
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,800
the past

1291
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,280
we have you know the um we have

1292
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,440
corporate c-certs we have

1293
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,079
country-level c-certs there's going to

1294
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,079
be a shift in terms of where your data

1295
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,359
is coming in

1296
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:29,280
and you should see an increase in logs

1297
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,680
so your sim systems your drc systems

1298
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,839
we should start to see that more with

1299
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,440
the zero trust

1300
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,640
push and you know additional logging at

1301
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,839
you know these these borders between uh

1302
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:47,040
modules or components in systems

1303
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,520
that will be a leverage point and that

1304
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,880
will be where you might do

1305
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,640
aiml for your detection capabilities

1306
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,119
you're going to start to look within

1307
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,160
expected bounds for unusual patterns

1308
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,680
right and so it's going to be a little

1309
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,599
bit of a shift

1310
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,680
but the c-certs really should be trying

1311
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,720
to figure out

1312
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,839
how do we embrace these trends how do we

1313
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,119
effectively deploy

1314
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,599
encryption and does that mean we also

1315
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,359
have to say to the network team

1316
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,119
hey we really should think about ipv6

1317
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,720
right so that would be a change for c

1318
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,559
cert team to be pushing for

1319
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,480
something like ipv6 and working with the

1320
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,079
network team and saying

1321
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,559
you know we have to start thinking about

1322
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,240
adding these new controls in

1323
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,160
and as such we want to make sure you

1324
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,839
have capabilities that you need

1325
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,400
and so ipv6 routing overlay protocols if

1326
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,079
they're not in use already

1327
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,119
are some ways to go about that

1328
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,160
working with the security teams

1329
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,040
who deploy the hardened images so

1330
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,960
c-serts teams if you're engaging with

1331
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,920
those

1332
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,880
you know those folks figuring out how do

1333
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,760
you get alerts

1334
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,800
on on problems um

1335
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,040
how do you tie in better with the other

1336
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,880
teams who are deploying if if you're a

1337
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,319
large shop

1338
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,440
and then if you're a small shop working

1339
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,720
with your vendor

1340
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,319
making sure your vendor is starting to

1341
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,480
bake in these controls for you

1342
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,800
because in actuality the security should

1343
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,760
just work

1344
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,680
and for the large organizations you

1345
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,280
still have those attackers remember in

1346
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,079
the beginning

1347
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,440
who were doing reconnaissance and

1348
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,119
figuring out your weak points

1349
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,160
if your vendor of some specific tool

1350
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,359
isn't able to um

1351
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,520
you know secure their environment and

1352
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,040
their vendors aren't

1353
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,880
doing things to build in controls then

1354
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,880
you're still at risk

1355
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,280
so some of this outreach for c-certs

1356
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,480
would be really important

1357
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,720
and to work with large vendors so there

1358
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,839
will be a place

1359
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,000
i think you should have no fear about

1360
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,920
you know job security your job might

1361
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,720
change

1362
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,839
but look to see how it should change

1363
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,599
you know where you sit might change you

1364
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,599
might move to the vendor so that you're

1365
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,720
helping to bake in the security but you

1366
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,880
know we're not going to go from a 3.5

1367
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,680
million person deficit to none right so

1368
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,000
there's

1369
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,480
opportunity there's lots of places think

1370
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,640
really wisely about how do we scale

1371
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,559
how do we close that gap because it's

1372
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:09,839
not going to happen through training

1373
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:10,720
alone

1374
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,680
there's not 3.5 million people who can

1375
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,839
jump into these types of roles

1376
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,480
thank you kathleen i will get a question

1377
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,319
that i i saw on

1378
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,599
um on

1379
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,920
uh on chat uh it was not on the q a but

1380
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,680
which framework or checklist do you

1381
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,920
recommend you use to assess the security

1382
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,720
posture

1383
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,760
of a small organization like chinese

1384
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,480
employers uh do you recommend to use the

1385
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,079
same against the vendors so how often

1386
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,280
right so the cis controls is where

1387
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,839
we begin so if you're looking for um you

1388
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,119
know to assess

1389
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,240
the cis controls um you know and

1390
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,760
you'll hear this from more than people

1391
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,160
that work for cis

1392
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,160
they have done a lot of work to

1393
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,079
prioritize the controls to make sure

1394
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,599
you're going after the biggest threats

1395
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:04,880
in the environment

1396
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,119
you'll reduce your risk the most by

1397
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:08,480
going after those

1398
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,480
and it will give you a way to go to the

1399
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,240
board or wherever you need to go to

1400
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,280
to justify any budget to say

1401
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,040
we can reduce our risk by this

1402
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,040
percentage by implementing

1403
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,280
these top controls or we have this gap

1404
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,319
and it means

1405
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,240
that we are currently exposed to the

1406
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,520
biggest risks

1407
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,200
you know the top 80 percent of of risks

1408
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,200
so that's really where i would recommend

1409
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,359
is is going after the cis controls

1410
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,599
and they map into all of the major

1411
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,559
frameworks

1412
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,240
so if you were looking to move to a more

1413
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,480
sophisticated grc program

1414
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,040
you can still do that and it's flexible

1415
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,200
the cis controls and that they map into

1416
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,720
each of those frameworks so it's a good

1417
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,559
starting point

1418
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:49,920
even if you you know if you wind up with

1419
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,520
the nist cyber security controls you

1420
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,319
wind up with iso 27001 it's not a

1421
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:54,880
problem

1422
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,200
there's direct mappings between these

1423
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,640
and the cis

1424
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,079
controls and benchmarks are really

1425
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,079
prescriptive and provide a lot of

1426
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:02,880
guidance

1427
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,599
as well as options you're not always

1428
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,640
going to choose the

1429
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,880
the strictest option within those

1430
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,920
controls

1431
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,680
or benchmarks thank you kathleen

1432
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,720
um i have a few more questions i will

1433
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,520
just get

1434
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,599
one because we are going in over time

1435
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,680
i've got a nicholas leave question and

1436
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,800
you mentioned the shortage of expertise

1437
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,760
in the cyber security field uh what we

1438
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,440
are seeing in our organization

1439
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,240
is a as a result we have the technical

1440
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,319
leads and operators

1441
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,800
of our security response teams having to

1442
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,880
take on the burden of transforming

1443
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,400
information security

1444
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,599
and doing these high-level projects

1445
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,839
we are where and how you build expertise

1446
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,440
of your organization to take

1447
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,880
these problems in transforming

1448
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,440
information security without taking away

1449
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,200
from those that do the day-to-day

1450
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,640
job understanding response

1451
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,160
okay um i've always had a lot of energy

1452
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,240
so

1453
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,160
um i think it goes into your motivation

1454
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,920
and if you don't do this i think you're

1455
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,400
going to be

1456
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,559
at a bigger risk even for your job so

1457
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,559
your your current functions

1458
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,640
they're not going to continue because

1459
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,319
you're going to be asked to increase

1460
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:25,280
encryption

1461
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,760
you're going to see these changes happen

1462
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,280
around you

1463
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,880
it's going to take some initiative

1464
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,720
you're going to have to do some research

1465
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,559
and figure out you know how do you move

1466
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,480
to these controls

1467
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,160
one way that you can do it if you don't

1468
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,079
have the resources is just push on your

1469
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,599
vendors when your vendors come in for a

1470
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:46,400
meeting

1471
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,040
you know be educated think about those

1472
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,720
patterns at scale

1473
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,559
you know my book provides additional

1474
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,640
examples not just what i went over in

1475
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,440
the talk today

1476
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,760
so you know that is something to

1477
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,079
consider as well

1478
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,480
okay uh i'll start with got it though

1479
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,400
just one but i will get one more

1480
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,480
just because it's a question from caltra

1481
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,640
that it's also interesting from

1482
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,640
my my perspective as part of a national

1483
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,160
a national cesar team so and

1484
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,920
how about the transformation from the

1485
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,440
national cesar perspective

1486
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,599
that's a good question i think your

1487
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,359
touch points and who you work with might

1488
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:28,400
change

1489
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,440
um you know with sharing groups

1490
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,359
we've really focused on getting data out

1491
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,359
to each organization

1492
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,720
what if we're getting it out to the

1493
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,400
vendors instead

1494
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,920
and so you know working with things like

1495
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,760
google project zero more

1496
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,800
working with the vendors directly to uh

1497
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,440
you know do remediation to build in

1498
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,480
security

1499
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,040
and so that the impact is greater if

1500
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,400
you're just working with

1501
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,680
each of the individual companies and

1502
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,599
you're not focused on the places where

1503
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:00,720
you can have the largest

1504
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,319
impact then i think you're going to have

1505
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,240
a problem so as a national sea cert

1506
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,160
i think engaging the vendors more and

1507
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,720
thinking about patterns that scale

1508
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,960
is even more important right because

1509
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,720
what kind of tone are you setting for

1510
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,240
the organizations

1511
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,000
you know if you're putting the onus back

1512
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,920
onto each individual organization to

1513
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,800
manage

1514
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,280
controls they're going to continue to be

1515
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,160
at a loss

1516
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,279
in terms of resources

1517
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,160
thank you so much kathleen thank you

1518
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:30,640
thank you

1519
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,000
thank you yeah well

1520
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,720
