for my company so

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:09,840
just starting

50
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,889
[Music]

51
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
so

52
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,388
[Music]

53
00:02:51,030 --> 00:03:02,199
[Music]

54
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,990
[Music]

55
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,640
oops uh thank you so

56
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,599
let's uh let's start so i'm here to talk

57
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,120
about uh cyber rating

58
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,599
and i think the the first thing you you

59
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,800
should ask

60
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,400
uh this is what is saber rating so

61
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,280
uh i think we should put cyber rating in

62
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,560
opportunity for the

63
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,040
traditional financial scoring i suppose

64
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,720
everybody knows somehow

65
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,159
switch or movies which was used during

66
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,760
the financial crisis

67
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,879
basically this company goes in you are

68
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,720
they are collecting information

69
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
and based on that they are putting to

70
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,760
you some uh

71
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,959
some some financial rating a score from

72
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:51,360
d

73
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,040
to a triple a it's the same for

74
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,799
cyber cyber security we have seen many

75
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,280
actors for example beatsides

76
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,640
sight rating or security scorecards

77
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,920
it's the same they are collecting

78
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,560
information which is mostly public and

79
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,400
based on that they are making a score

80
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,840
from from our standpoint so it's a

81
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,839
business trend because with this public

82
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,199
information we get

83
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,279
we can get a footprint of what we are

84
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,400
doing so

85
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,720
said otherwise it is an efficient tool

86
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,600
to discover the

87
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,880
shadow idea but from a communication

88
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,680
standpoint uh it is a representation of

89
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,919
the security level of the vinci group

90
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,080
so you can see at the right you got a

91
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,320
picture of for a cio

92
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,240
explaining to all the cfo of the group

93
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,440
why your score is not as good as uh as

94
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,639
can be here

95
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,360
and the position with your competition

96
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,919
he wanted to explain that he needed to

97
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,280
have more budget and things like that

98
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,360
there is a third point which is a cyber

99
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,120
insurance premium

100
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,400
we got a lot of ransomware campaigns

101
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,840
at the moment and to be protected

102
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,960
to to limit the financial loss most

103
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,120
many companies are subscribing to tune

104
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,800
insurance but this insurance

105
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,479
as they need to understand the level of

106
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,120
risk and if we are good or not so

107
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,400
they need to collect information uh to

108
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,039
to know if we are good or not

109
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,479
um so this is uh what uh what's look for

110
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,240
so for one uh cyber company so you can

111
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,680
see you got the name

112
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,360
of the company you just get a score

113
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,560
and then you see the trainer for another

114
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
company it's the same you see

115
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,680
your company your score and

116
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,120
the trend and for a third company the

117
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,520
same

118
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,320
again you see your company name you see

119
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,520
your score and you see

120
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,360
the train so basically for a ciso of a

121
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,160
large company you get in a single

122
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,880
indicator

123
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,759
the security level for the one company

124
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,479
always computed the rating when you go

125
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,600
into the interface

126
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,280
you find many many subscore

127
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
which can be regrouped in many

128
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,400
subcategories

129
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,319
so you can see for example for this one

130
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,000
uh you got compromise system

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,680
diligence user behavior public

132
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,280
disclosure and then many

133
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,319
sub things for this one you can see best

134
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,120
practices

135
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,160
or reputation and for the last

136
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,800
one you see many many categories for

137
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,880
example network security or patching

138
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
cadence or

139
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,000
endpoint security uh in short if you

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,039
try to want to summarize what this

141
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,840
company are checking it's basically

142
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,240
compliance

143
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,199
compliance with some some rules the spf

144
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,560
record and so on

145
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,039
and on the other one and and the other

146
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,160
one is more about

147
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,199
the events typically act system

148
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,080
or if your ip is listed in a in a

149
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,560
blacklist

150
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,240
so what is a business use for this for

151
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,800
this

152
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,039
score you can use it for yourself

153
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,759
but you can also use it for your

154
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,039
supplier

155
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,240
or maybe you want to for your budget you

156
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,680
want to assess the security of your

157
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,880
competitor

158
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,720
or maybe if you are planning to buy a

159
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,440
company you can ask a rating

160
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,319
for that but if you pay attention to

161
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,520
this rating

162
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,880
you can see that uh microsoft that i

163
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,000
use for my uh my example

164
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,120
they have a pretty bad score so what i

165
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,599
was

166
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,879
expecting uh is that of course

167
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,440
microsoft they have azure they have all

168
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,960
their customers

169
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,000
and the score is bad because of that

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,479
but i was surprised because if i looked

171
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,759
at the compliance with

172
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,800
spf you can see that for many

173
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,840
microsoft domains

174
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,360
they have no no spf maybe they have

175
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,479
other protection

176
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,520
but they have no spf and because there

177
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,319
is some

178
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,039
checked with a certificate i was able to

179
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,360
find this example in france

180
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,280
with a old server where the certificate

181
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,520
has expired and the question is

182
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,520
the score is used to assess the security

183
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,720
level so

184
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,280
if i stick to it i won't buy any service

185
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,479
to microsoft

186
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,320
but will it be the reality microsoft has

187
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,760
a bad score but

188
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,039
they cannot be avoided when you want to

189
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,319
to develop your company

190
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,959
so let's go into details and try to

191
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,279
to know how it's work how it's working

192
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,120
i think it can be summarized in a

193
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,959
three-step process

194
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,120
the first one is to build the internet

195
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,040
footprint basically you have to collect

196
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,160
all the ip

197
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,720
dns everything that is used by the

198
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,160
company

199
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,480
then for each asset you need to to run

200
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,360
scans

201
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,279
to to find out if they are complying

202
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,200
with your

203
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,080
your roles or or not and then with all

204
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,519
this information

205
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,680
you apply an algorithm and you build a

206
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,760
global score

207
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,640
if you go into details you will find

208
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,279
that for

209
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,000
for example for vinci uh you are

210
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,720
expecting

211
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,320
that uh the cyber rating companies are

212
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,279
going to google

213
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,760
trying to find all your subsidiaries

214
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,040
find any

215
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,160
legal legal book to

216
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,600
to get to it but in practice this is not

217
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,320
what

218
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,920
what we have seen what we what we feel

219
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,200
is that this company goes to they go to

220
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,720
your website

221
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
your copyright website they are looking

222
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,480
for a communication

223
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,200
uh website that can be referenced in

224
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
your in your

225
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,600
in your copyright website or maybe if

226
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
you have some address

227
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,000
or if you have a financial report

228
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,160
[Music]

229
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,519
it's more using that because we when we

230
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,000
look

231
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,720
at the domain names that are that are

232
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,640
being reported

233
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,680
in the in the tool uh we found out some

234
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,720
domains which

235
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,079
are referenced said only on this website

236
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,000
and uh you know you have the companies

237
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,240
that you buy uh the companies that you

238
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,959
sold

239
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,680
and with that you can try to understand

240
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,079
what

241
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,399
was the source and the information and

242
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,440
then once you got all the domain

243
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,839
that are belonging to you they are

244
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,160
running a technical

245
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,839
algorithm to try to find all the ip

246
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,240
related to that for example they can

247
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,959
look at

248
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,920
with records they can also use a

249
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,959
certificate from

250
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,399
transparency records or passive dns for

251
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,600
example

252
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,240
and they are doing iterations with that

253
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,680
i mean if you got

254
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,240
a dns you can then get an ip and then

255
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,600
you are doing a reverse

256
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,880
dns and then you you do a loop

257
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,880
until you have found out all the assets

258
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,120
but uh we have to talk about the

259
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,160
effectiveness

260
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,519
of this asset collection um this

261
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,360
after uh having looked

262
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,360
at the at the celebrating companies

263
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,240
about the results we we wanted to

264
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,800
understand

265
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,120
what was said behind you can see for

266
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,399
example at the

267
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,440
at the top left you have domain

268
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,560
which has expired so you see all the

269
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
marketing and so on

270
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,079
and basically the cyber rating companies

271
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,040
they cannot see it you can have also

272
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,560
issues made by the communication

273
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,440
department

274
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,200
when they are referencing a

275
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,880
public public website which is part of

276
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,519
the

277
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,079
community you can see also

278
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,440
another way uh another kind of domain

279
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,399
which has expired

280
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,760
which is the main reuse so what we see

281
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,240
typically in asia they need to have

282
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,200
a good a good rating regarding process

283
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,360
to be able to not be filtered out

284
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,680
and so they are looking for domains

285
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,440
which expires

286
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,360
and this website is a gambling website

287
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,680
at the left you have the classic uh

288
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,000
servers which has been reset

289
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,639
in the middle you can find also a

290
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,000
fishing phishing domain

291
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,040
which is close to your website

292
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,079
which is then added into the

293
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,560
into the separating companies or at the

294
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,360
right

295
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,000
uh you have everything about the dns

296
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,120
everything is good

297
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,399
uh the dns didn't not expired but

298
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,240
you just remove one server and you

299
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,320
forgot to remove the dns record

300
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,440
as a consequence the cpa is uh this ip

301
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,639
is reused

302
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,880
and then your dns record point to a

303
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,440
website that doesn't belong to you

304
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,200
so basically you have a lot of garbage

305
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,959
um i wanted to to compare

306
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,040
what the providers see in order to to

307
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,880
understand if their view was

308
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,480
consistent or no i think the view is

309
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,760
consistent

310
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,560
in this example of course it's tlp-wide

311
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,360
so there is

312
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,959
no company here you got one company

313
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,120
which is very centralized

314
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
at the right another one which is very

315
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,320
decentralized

316
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,560
at the bottom a mix you know when you

317
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,800
have two companies which are

318
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,720
being merged together you can you can

319
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,040
find the different clusters

320
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,839
and if you look at this uh graphical

321
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,360
representation i think it's quite

322
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,720
accurate

323
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,279
but then when you compare the number of

324
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,959
assets

325
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,399
among different cyber team companies

326
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,600
it's very different i mean for this

327
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,880
company the middle for one pointer it

328
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,279
was

329
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,959
90 000 from another one it was

330
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,480
9 000 and for another one it was only

331
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,320
900.

332
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,360
so we have to be very cautious

333
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,920
about that

334
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,480
and if you want the explanation

335
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
basically you have some ip range

336
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,880
some ip range and for the last companies

337
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,440
i didn't pick all the dns records

338
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,600
um when you have a large organization

339
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,760
your goal i think it's to manage the

340
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,639
shadow idea so every every time you got

341
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,480
a problem you want to

342
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,600
to see okay this is uh

343
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,519
something you have to deal with i need

344
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,920
to call this guy

345
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,399
and sadly for this cyber rating

346
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,600
companies they don't

347
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,240
care about resolution their business

348
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,079
model is to provide score not to to

349
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,000
solve the problem

350
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,440
so there is almost no translational

351
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,480
views and means that

352
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,880
you get all the data linux in an excel

353
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,959
file and that's all

354
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,279
one company is providing some kind of

355
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,519
tree

356
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,399
the user can share and access all the

357
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,079
data transversally

358
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:27,040
and the last one you have many

359
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,240
many score scouts but you have to look

360
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,839
at each scorecard to get all the data

361
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,360
so it's very difficult to have a

362
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,440
transformer view you have a lot of

363
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,079
false positives typically when you are

364
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,839
selling your company and it's made

365
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,560
it's not made public as a cyber writing

366
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,920
company don't know it

367
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,360
or if you want to buy some company

368
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,320
they are not aware of it some companies

369
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,600
can add it

370
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,720
i remind about one company which

371
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,680
don't want to add companies like that

372
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,120
it's very difficult

373
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,440
and you have also a difficulty to to

374
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,639
contextualize

375
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,000
your scoring i can give you an example

376
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,959
if someone is visiting your premises and

377
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:11,279
you

378
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,839
want to give them some wi-fi access you

379
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:14,560
will use

380
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,600
a wi-fi guest so they can

381
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,480
not use your infrastructure but maybe

382
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,680
the ap

383
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,680
seen from the internet of this of this

384
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,800
guy uh

385
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,759
belong to your to your network so it

386
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,320
will be

387
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,560
considered as a problem if the guy has

388
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,639
some some malware

389
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,959
a typical example is for all

390
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,240
infrastructures

391
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,800
for example an airport if they are

392
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,519
starting some isp activities

393
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,720
as a customer for their isp activities

394
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,959
every bad practices it will be

395
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,279
considered against the main companies

396
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,560
and i checked with almost 10

397
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,880
large companies they have at least two

398
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,480
or three examples like that

399
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,639
so you want to manage your shadow idea

400
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,199
you can have some some viewer but it may

401
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,640
not match your

402
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,839
what you see internally um

403
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,240
as i said you have two kind of data

404
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,959
collection

405
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,919
the first one is about malware so what

406
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:16,799
we can see

407
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,000
is that there is mainly two kind of uh

408
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,319
of sources the first one is the

409
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,319
sinkholing the second one is a blacklist

410
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,240
so sinkholing as a reminder is that you

411
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,439
you get a malware

412
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,360
you reverse it you understand okay as

413
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,880
the malware will try to reach this

414
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,799
domain this domain is domain and

415
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,760
the the bad guy just to to register for

416
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,400
one

417
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,160
so you will register one of this domain

418
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,240
and you are waiting for the connection

419
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,640
so with this ip you you you match your

420
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,600
customer

421
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,200
so two providers of three are using this

422
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,320
technique

423
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,039
and for the blacklist i found out that

424
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,880
two providers out of three but not the

425
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,600
same

426
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,640
are using a blacklist so this one they

427
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,120
are

428
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,320
trying to find if your ip

429
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,919
is on the back list for example spy

430
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,840
mouse but it's noisy

431
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,000
or frustrating if you are using shell

432
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,679
sting

433
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,039
and the blacklist source selection

434
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,559
is questionable for the signaling it's

435
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,760
very effective if the iep in is

436
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,039
in the official range you are managing

437
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,480
but you are missing the proxy cloud or

438
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,799
non-public ip

439
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,919
also because this uh bad things it's a

440
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,559
neon event and it's not continuous

441
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,320
uh the cyber rating provider has to

442
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,679
give more impact on this on this

443
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,039
uh for the compliance uh in short

444
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,919
uh it's quite the same because they are

445
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,679
looking for the dns records they are

446
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,840
looking for the tls configuration they

447
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,440
are looking for the web alert

448
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,760
however at a given at a specific

449
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,000
evaluation it's different for example

450
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,679
for the spf

451
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,280
some companies did some

452
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,559
it's not ranking the same if you have a

453
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,600
question mark all

454
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,360
or till all or minus all

455
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,240
also if you remove you say okay it's a

456
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,799
bad

457
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,440
server just remove it some company

458
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,840
considers that the scan wasn't

459
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,000
successful

460
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,840
and you can have this anomaly up to

461
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,039
three months

462
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,320
after i didn't fix it so it's basically

463
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,880
the same but presented differently

464
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,000
i have also made the exercise to compare

465
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,120
the scoring of one companies with many

466
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,520
providers

467
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,760
you can see at the top the number of

468
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,799
assets that

469
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,799
everybody can that all the

470
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,440
companies can see at the bottom you can

471
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,600
see the individual score

472
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,080
and the final score at the bottom what

473
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,039
you can find out

474
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,880
is that um the evaluation

475
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,880
is it's not the same for a specific

476
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,440
company but if you look

477
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,919
at the different provider of the same

478
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:08,880
provider

479
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,720
but for a different company you will

480
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,559
find out that the evaluation is quite

481
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,760
the same

482
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,360
and what we have seen is that the lower

483
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,840
the company is the best rating is

484
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,280
because when you are bigger

485
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,000
you add up everything you have in the

486
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,440
smallest company

487
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,760
and then you get a very bad score

488
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,600
if we are doing root cause analysis for

489
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,159
the

490
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,600
bat score regime most of the time

491
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,720
the bat score is leaked to 60 percent uh

492
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
for malware but wearing double quotes

493
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,320
because it can be blacklist

494
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,120
a car a shared hosting or it can be

495
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,280
calling or it can be

496
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,159
things like that for 30 percent is more

497
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:52,799
about

498
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,559
shadow idea what i'm calling shadow it

499
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,280
is mostly

500
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,480
a marketing website you know the

501
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,159
website put for cheap for 10 euros a

502
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,200
year

503
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,559
and only 10 percent is related to

504
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,600
what you are doing locally

505
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,440
so uh given this uh this facts

506
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,760
or can you handle uh the cyber rating

507
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,919
and uh and improve it

508
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,960
so um i think you you need to pay

509
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,600
attention

510
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,360
to two facts what is the compliance and

511
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,039
what is the security

512
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,120
compliance you have to fix it even if it

513
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,400
is stupid

514
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,320
and security you have to fix it because

515
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,799
it provides additional mitigation

516
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,520
and even it is bad it is enlisting you

517
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,159
may have

518
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,240
another workaround in practice it's

519
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,360
more like that you you present it to the

520
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,240
management

521
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,039
the management is not okay and you have

522
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,000
to speak with

523
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,360
with the guy below and in practice there

524
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,559
is no change

525
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,360
one three six months six months after

526
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,520
it's uh it's a human problem

527
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,600
so before starting the project what i

528
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,159
recommend is to work on the scope

529
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,559
basically what i have done is just check

530
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,559
that the domain i sent to you belong to

531
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,600
you

532
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,559
and for the cleanup you have to report

533
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,200
or remove

534
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,559
all the dns records for all things or

535
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,240
maybe you have a blacklist

536
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,000
record which is 10 years old

537
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,640
then you have to do some project

538
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,000
steering you have to go

539
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,919
to the management and explain what you

540
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,200
are going to do

541
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,280
if you don't the management will expect

542
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,240
that you feel

543
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,200
you fix 80 of the problem in three

544
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,000
months

545
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,720
in real life it's more about three or

546
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,480
two to three years

547
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,039
uh so this is what i have done to my to

548
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,280
my management

549
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,559
uh to do the project we need uh what i

550
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,120
recommend

551
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,679
is to do uh four things the first one is

552
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,559
a lot of webinar to explain to everyone

553
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,440
what is the problem why why we need to

554
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:57,840
fix

555
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,320
and what we can do in order to fix it

556
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,159
because if you just put

557
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,000
a directive asking to fix it

558
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,039
people won't spend the energy to to fix

559
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,039
a problem they don't understand

560
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,320
then to provide support

561
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,520
what we have done is that we have

562
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,720
we can our team is providing support

563
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,880
either technical or rather in terms of

564
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,480
escalation we are unzolding so we can

565
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,679
we have a lot of power they're made to

566
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,000
then to provide to create a mediation

567
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,520
kit

568
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,240
when you want to fix the spf each time

569
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,520
people will start to

570
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,480
to write the document 20 times so you

571
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,400
need to provide it before the project

572
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,880
and then at the end provide a dashboard

573
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,760
which is representative of their effort

574
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,840
because if you stick to the score it

575
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,880
won't work

576
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,960
we have about four minutes left just for

577
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,799
you okay i will speed up

578
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,720
so this is an example of remediation kit

579
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,880
just a word document

580
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
this is an example of dashboard so you

581
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,640
want to benchmark your entity you want

582
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,559
to check at the left if they are aware

583
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,279
of this project and then you select a

584
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,799
new few checks

585
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,760
to know if it's okay or not if you don't

586
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,000
if you stick to the local score

587
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,679
it will be better than the group score

588
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,000
and you won't get any advance

589
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,400
and this is an example of what's going

590
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,600
on

591
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,480
for one year at the first step you can

592
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,919
see that there is some cleaning so the

593
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,120
score is improving you don't do anything

594
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,200
uh then on this phase there is some

595
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,320
cleanup so you see

596
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,159
there is a lot of increase uh

597
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,360
then you can see uh at the top it's all

598
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,200
the subsidiary and at the bottom in the

599
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,000
group

600
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,400
this is a lower score it's it's normal

601
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,159
because you you take all the problem for

602
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,360
other things

603
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,279
and you can see that for example this bu

604
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,600
has decided to add more assets

605
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,679
and as the consequences their scores are

606
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,320
decreasing

607
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,360
but there is no huge improvement because

608
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,039
once you fix an issue another one

609
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,720
appears

610
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,760
um and if you want to to improve your

611
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,919
score you can choose to have a security

612
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,200
by obscurity and so if you want to hide

613
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,679
my advice is to not use a public ip for

614
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:16,960
your proxy

615
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,720
do not use an ip in a in a networks that

616
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,080
that you own and please don't set a dns

617
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,600
record for this ip

618
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,400
so this time the cyber racing company

619
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,640
won't be able to see you

620
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,720
but you won't get additional security

621
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,480
time for my my conclusion

622
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,320
does does a good cyber score to get a

623
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,360
bigger security

624
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,000
except the spf or the sinkhole i don't

625
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,480
think so

626
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,000
can you really act on your score

627
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,679
on 80 percent of the report it's

628
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,440
difficult to act uh you have shared

629
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,120
those things or the application

630
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,159
and the feedback uh on the teams uh is

631
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,559
that there was a lot of energy expense

632
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:04,960
for

633
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,400
small results so the two are not fully

634
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,360
mature

635
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,480
is it just about compliance uh

636
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,000
there are more and more cloud exposure

637
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
tools even a person so you can think

638
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,400
about

639
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,679
availability for example but with

640
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,120
with your cloud exposure ice and your

641
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,840
cyber insurance premium i think that

642
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,159
these tools will merge into a

643
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,279
cloud exposure solution that i'm

644
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,799
which is basically the separating

645
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,030
companies and i'm done

646
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,960
[Music]

647
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,799
cool i think we have one minute left so

648
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,960
maybe let's get at least one question

649
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,760
uh out um there was one question do you

650
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,360
think there is any value

651
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
in using cyber rating companies to

652
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,520
evaluate third party vendors

653
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,640
or do they show a false perpetration of

654
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,919
security maturity or security risk

655
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,240
we have spent some money on that but i

656
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,960
don't think

657
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,880
it will change the buying decision

658
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,679
okay then let's maybe do the other one

659
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,320
as well

660
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,440
um it was from anonymous last time i

661
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,600
checked out the cyber writing company

662
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,760
they were not doing a good job at

663
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,640
examiner

664
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,840
exi mining public cloud workload

665
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,240
as they were mainly looking at ip

666
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,000
addresses range registered

667
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,399
in the name of the company being rated

668
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,520
what is your view

669
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,919
on the relevance of cyber rating for

670
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,279
companies going cloud first

671
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,039
it's not very efficient it's very

672
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,399
efficient when you have

673
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,960
your network range which is public and

674
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,840
so on

675
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,480
so it's mostly for a company which has a

676
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,279
lot of

677
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,320
legacy legacy tunnel for that it's very

678
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,240
efficient you just pay once you get your

679
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,080
dashboard with all your company and

680
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,039
you're good

681
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,600
