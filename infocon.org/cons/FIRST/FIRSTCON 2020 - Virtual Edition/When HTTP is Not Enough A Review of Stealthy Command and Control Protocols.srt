1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,120
hid and i work for uh ap nick

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,279
um a pleasure to be here with all of you

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,319
today

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,559
um let me introduce the speaker that we

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:09,760
have for our session

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,880
uh he is matthew fowle from eset

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,799
and the title of his presentation is

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,720
when http is not enough

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,960
a review of stealthy command and control

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,760
protocols

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,600
before passing to him i'd like to remind

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,880
everybody to

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,599
put your questions to the q a and look

14
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,880
forward to your questions and

15
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,960
interacting with matt

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,960
so without further ado over to you matt

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,840
your mic is off

18
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,039
yeah so sorry thanks for the

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,160
introduction

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,360
uh hello i hope you're all enjoying this

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,640
virtual edition of first 2020

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,480
today we are going to talk about

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,039
stealthy comment control protocols

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,920
and i'm going to use example with and

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,960
control doing

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,240
our investigation

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,080
so i'm matu faux a malware researcher at

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,280
eset my day-to-day job is to track

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,640
apts by leveraging the asap telemetry

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,880
so finding new malware families or

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,680
unknown malicious campaigns so in the

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,159
past few years i mainly focus on apt

33
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,600
such as jolao

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,679
and zodiac's ept-29

35
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,320
so the plan for today first i will

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,360
define what has

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,280
what i call traditional or basic

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,040
commonly controlled protocol

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,360
then i will give examples of stealthy

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
command control protocols we've seen the

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,759
while

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,880
so i've i will mainly use example

43
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,799
of apt's campaign because that's why i'm

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,159
generally looking at but it's uh

45
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,439
like applicable to any kind of

46
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,240
malicious trajectory and you'll see the

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,439
exact same techniques

48
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,878
use used by firmware actors

49
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,920
finally i gave some ideas of

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,200
countermeasure or

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,319
mitigations for the examples

52
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,920
i will talk about so first traditional

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,560
common control protocols i guess that

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,319
everybody

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,080
already looked at some http or https

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
based command protocol protocol where

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,920
the command control url

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,840
is directly hard coded in the malware

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,160
sample so this is a

60
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,959
basic example from for malware called

61
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:39,519
likes

62
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,080
as sourceful media that was written

63
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,840
recently outed by

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,400
the us cybercon so you can see that

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,120
there is a

66
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,200
you are directly outputting the mario

67
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,239
sample so

68
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,080
there is any anything like encryption or

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,560
so if you run this mirror in the sandbox

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,280
you'll have

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,200
direct access to the command control

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,640
protocol url

73
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,840
some other malware family use what we

74
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,159
call a domain generation algorithm

75
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,800
so it means that the command control

76
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,920
domain or url

77
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,400
is not stored anywhere in the malware

78
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,360
but what's

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,200
in the malware is the algorithm to

80
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,400
generate

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,239
this domain so generally these domains

82
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,000
this algorithm take a seed

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,200
that can be based on the date or or

84
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,680
on an unpredictable value such as for

85
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,280
example for the better malware family

86
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,400
they are using

87
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,799
foreign selections right so it was not

88
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,680
possible

89
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,959
to to to determine

90
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,239
what will be the the next

91
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,480
the next domains and they can be only

92
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,760
register

93
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,879
the day they will be used

94
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,760
so what's the problem for the attacker

95
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,239
with

96
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,159
these this kind of command control

97
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,360
protocols

98
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,400
first they all use domain with no

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,159
or lower reputation so they are likely

100
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,879
to be blocking corporate environments

101
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,159
and even if they are running a sandbox

102
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,599
prior to executions

103
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,519
as a sandbox will be able to determine

104
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,680
that it's reaching out to a very

105
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,120
suspicious domain

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,959
and even if it's not blocking the

107
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,560
sandbox if

108
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,320
in your telemetry or logs you see that

109
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,800
big amount of data are sent to a

110
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,360
suspicious

111
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,600
an unknown domain it might wife's

112
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,919
questions

113
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,919
so i'm going to present

114
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,360
some examples that's like some

115
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,600
techniques attacker used to either

116
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,080
bypass sandbox or

117
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,000
or log and telemetry

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,360
so uh first one uh i will present like

119
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,199
the miter technique because

120
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,240
for like a i choose three different

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,440
techniques for today

122
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,320
and that miter did a great job at like

123
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,120
summarizing

124
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,919
those techniques so the first one is web

125
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,560
service

126
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,759
so it means that um attackers they will

127
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,759
rely on web services that

128
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,479
web service our website like facebook

129
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,280
dropbox

130
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,479
twitter anything that can be used

131
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,840
legitimately

132
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,800
to store data but as it can be used

133
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,880
legitimately to store that

134
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,960
data it can also be used by malicious

135
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,720
trait actor

136
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,919
as a royal relay between their

137
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:28,800
infrastructure

138
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,320
and and the victim

139
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,479
so from an attacker perspective first

140
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,680
when the

141
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,680
malicious sample is run in a sandbox

142
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,160
with those without internet access

143
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,370
you will only see connection to

144
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,960
[Music]

145
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,080
the the public service so

146
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,880
the sandbox won't be able to to realize

147
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,320
that

148
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,600
connection is suspicious

149
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,440
also in your logs you won't see

150
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,000
or you will see less communications with

151
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,080
low reputation domains

152
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,919
it will also blend to the network

153
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,560
traffic because it's quite usual to

154
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,720
to send big amount of data to web

155
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,680
services such as

156
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,080
dropbox obviously depending on

157
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,880
what your typical user is doing but it

158
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,759
can be

159
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,560
like they can use dropbox for their uh

160
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,080
real job

161
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,759
and also as i said like some user

162
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,240
may need public service for their

163
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,360
day-to-day job

164
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,520
so it makes those services might be up

165
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,919
to block uh in a corporate environment

166
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,240
first example with the winning care

167
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,759
group so this

168
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,800
first set of examples they are aimed by

169
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,280
by passing some box so in the end

170
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,039
the the malware sample will still reach

171
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,080
out to a

172
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,599
to a domain under the control of the

173
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,000
attacker so first example is with win

174
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,120
nti also known as

175
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,440
apt-41 and they're well known for the

176
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,639
compromise of

177
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,680
gaming companies also supplication

178
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,680
attacks

179
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,400
and they chance to use public services

180
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,160
such as google docs

181
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,680
for example this is a google dollar they

182
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,280
use and

183
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,360
it will extract part of this uh fake uh

184
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,880
ssh key and

185
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,800
this so this this is what will be

186
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,599
extracted

187
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,680
and then it will be decrypted and it's

188
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,120
uh url

189
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,599
so if you run this sample in some box

190
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,160
without

191
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,319
internet access you will still just it

192
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,080
will just reach out to google docs

193
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,400
next example uh with jola and their

194
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,639
firefox extension that was reaching out

195
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,520
to uh

196
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,960
to instagram so they use the official

197
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,840
instagram of britney spear they included

198
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,039
a message

199
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,680
but if we look at the source code we

200
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,560
actually

201
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,520
can see that there is some suspicious

202
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,680
characters

203
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,759
um and these characters will be used

204
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,400
to reconstruct the url to a bit directly

205
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,759
link and this is uh it will be

206
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,840
it will redirect to the final comment

207
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
control server so again if running into

208
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,520
a sound box you will see only a

209
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,560
connection to

210
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,840
a brightness player installer

211
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,240
last example of this set is with a

212
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,080
polycloth duke which is a third stage

213
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,719
downloader used by the dukes or apt-29

214
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,039
why polyglot it's because they use

215
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,880
uncommon character and codings

216
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,640
and they put that on public services

217
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,560
such as twitter read it in your main

218
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,440
difference

219
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,120
uh from the two previous example if is

220
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,920
that in the same marvel sample they will

221
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,040
include links

222
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,560
to three different public service so for

223
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,040
for example a one-way link one twitter

224
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,880
link one in burling

225
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,920
so if one of them is blocked

226
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,600
in the victim network it is likely that

227
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,720
at least uh one or two of the other will

228
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,440
still work

229
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,279
so it is actually a quite good method to

230
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,240
bypass

231
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,519
um the as a block of

232
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,120
very specific public service

233
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,600
so this is an example on reddit so you

234
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,880
can see there is a

235
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,000
this very read weird encoding and it

236
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,880
actually decodes to the final url

237
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,440
we can see same thing on twitter and it

238
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,000
will also

239
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,120
decode to find your url so

240
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,279
as i said this example has aimed to

241
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,640
bypass soundbox

242
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,519
but we also have example with a

243
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,760
bidirectional communication

244
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,480
with uh with public service this is for

245
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,240
example nupas which is a

246
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,160
malware family that is probably operated

247
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,240
by the jokes even if it was first

248
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,760
attributed to chola

249
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,880
and it used it uses imbuer to

250
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,880
receive command and send data so there

251
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,399
is no

252
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,519
contact to to to a server controlled by

253
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,200
the attacker

254
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,000
how does it work it use technography so

255
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,360
the backdoor

256
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,600
for expectation the backdoor encode in

257
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,120
picture some data

258
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,240
and then use the http api to upload it

259
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,000
to embryo

260
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,959
and in the other way wrong attackers are

261
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:25,760
uploading

262
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,200
a picture with commands and coded

263
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,160
needs in them to enviro and then the new

264
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,079
passback door is will download

265
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,200
those pictures decode them and execute

266
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,240
the command

267
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,560
so in that case it's very different to

268
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,240
the three last example

269
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,959
because imgur will act as a proxy

270
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:45,760
between

271
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,920
the victim network and attacker

272
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,439
controller network resources

273
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,959
last example we scratch which is a

274
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:57,680
backdoor

275
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,200
used by chula and they use they use it

276
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,399
mainly to educate

277
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,600
documents and what's better than dropbox

278
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,480
to

279
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,399
exfiltrate documents and in that case

280
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,160
they will use the http official http api

281
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,560
of

282
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,760
of dropbox to to upload uh

283
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,480
archives containing stolen documents and

284
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,360
this archive can be then

285
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,760
reached with by the qr operators from

286
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,200
longbox but

287
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,120
from the defender perspective you'll see

288
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,200
only connection to dropbox as you don't

289
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,480
have access to the

290
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,600
to other side between dropbox and tlr

291
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,959
controlling the network infrastructure

292
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,360
and in the same way they will upload

293
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,279
comments to the dropbox seconds

294
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,360
and these comments are then downloaded

295
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,120
from directly from dropbox

296
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,800
by the crutchfactor so we can say that

297
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,839
dropbox is a proxy between crotch and

298
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,680
tour

299
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,200
now second technique with uh

300
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,959
may protocols and this is some

301
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,839
something uh we have seen an increasing

302
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,200
news especially with the

303
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,240
turret transactor so they are really

304
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,519
really a lot on on image as common

305
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,160
control

306
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,600
uh protocol in the past two

307
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,800
two or three years because

308
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,560
i guess uh security products or defender

309
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,079
made a lot of effort to block uh http

310
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,360
based

311
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,399
uh protocols so to be stealthy they have

312
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,760
to

313
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,120
to to level up their their techniques

314
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,959
first image are generally well monitored

315
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,240
for spam or

316
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,440
fishing but they are not

317
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,800
monitor a lot for for use as common for

318
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,440
protocol

319
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,600
also it is common to send big amount of

320
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,360
data by email because

321
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,680
people in their day-to-day job people

322
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,720
routinely send

323
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,040
documents big documents to people

324
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,920
outside

325
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,839
their organization

326
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
first example for this technique is

327
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,680
tural lag neuron

328
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,800
this is a custom malware for microsoft

329
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,639
exchange so microsoft action is the

330
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,000
on-premise

331
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,440
mail server of microsoft and it

332
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,399
acts as a transport agent transparent is

333
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,560
a feature of microsoft exchange

334
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,000
it's a kind of plugging system and

335
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
it's generally used by anti-spam

336
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,320
products so it allows a full access

337
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,680
to the to the main traffic and it allows

338
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,040
to set up

339
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,360
callbacks on events such as when an

340
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,519
email receive or when an email is sent

341
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,360
so this is how it works yeah it's

342
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,399
very complicated but uh

343
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,519
what you have to to rethink is that

344
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,399
light neuron is plugging very specific

345
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,959
uh

346
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,920
place of of exchange and it allows to

347
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,959
see

348
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,880
like for example when there is smtp

349
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
events or also when

350
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,199
an email goes through the mail server

351
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,360
so you have a microsoft exchange server

352
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,639
infected with light neuron every time an

353
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,120
email is sent or received by this

354
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,399
male server it later on will be called

355
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,880
it will be able to to process the e

356
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,399
minor

357
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,160
so there is two functionality in

358
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,839
electron first it can

359
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,839
modify image so for example it is able

360
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,680
to change the attachments or change the

361
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,480
subject

362
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,040
and changing the attachment is kind of

363
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,959
powerful because you can add

364
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,240
some zero day in in in

365
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,120
a document existing document for example

366
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,519
but

367
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,240
what interests us in that case is the

368
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,720
backdoor functionality

369
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,959
so it can execute comments that are

370
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,639
received by

371
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,560
by email and uh so this is an example

372
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,600
so this is a uh email

373
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,800
that is created by latinon to exfoliate

374
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,760
data

375
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,519
so as this is an example this is a

376
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,519
picture i i chose this is not the real

377
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,320
picture

378
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,880
uh two operators are using but this was

379
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,680
created by

380
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,160
black neuron and it is sent back to to

381
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,199
the operator

382
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,519
as you can see like everything looks

383
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,959
kind of legit because they use

384
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,399
technography to

385
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,959
to write data in the in the pdf

386
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:27,920
documents

387
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,839
so the pdf is still valid and

388
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,000
it just commands they are received by

389
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,880
the my server

390
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,880
and then block so the email is not

391
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,480
delivered to the final worship

392
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,320
recipient and it's the same for the

393
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,440
the traded data it's it is the email is

394
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,560
sent from

395
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,519
any email address of the of the exchange

396
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,880
server but

397
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,959
it is actually not visible by the end

398
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,800
user

399
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,399
so it's very hard to to notice

400
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,600
that the exchange server is

401
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,360
used as a main pivot point between the

402
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,079
external network and the compromise

403
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,480
organization

404
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,120
second example is with the chola outlook

405
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,920
background also known as facet

406
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,040
it's similar to lac neuron but instead

407
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,440
of

408
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,639
working on the server he's working on

409
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,279
microsoft outlook my client so only on

410
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,360
one victim machine

411
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,480
so it's a bit less healthy because the

412
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,160
email will still go through

413
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,720
the organization exchange server and

414
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,160
will be delivered to the

415
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,399
mail clients it leveraged

416
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,480
the mappy messaging application

417
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,000
programming interface which is an

418
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,639
official

419
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,920
api to to interact with microsoft clock

420
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,040
and manage images

421
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,000
same way as like neuron commands are

422
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,120
receiving pdf

423
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,079
pdf attachment and data is sent back

424
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,279
also by pdf attachment

425
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,240
so let's imagine that a chiller operator

426
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,000
sends a specially crafted email

427
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,720
attachment

428
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,039
to the email address of the uh of the

429
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:11,919
target

430
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,119
so this is not how the

431
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,520
the victim is compromised it the victim

432
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,280
has always been

433
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,079
was compromised before is outlook is

434
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,959
compromised

435
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,959
and then the terror operator sends a

436
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,799
special email to trigger the backdoor

437
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,919
functionality

438
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,280
of the backdoor then

439
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,440
the specially crafted pdf attachment is

440
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,400
extracted

441
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,679
uh it's uh the back door will uncover

442
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,000
the

443
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
the bytes decrypt them and the command

444
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,440
is executed so this

445
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,799
is a passive backdoor in the sense that

446
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,760
it doesn't reach out to a to a cnc

447
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,160
server but this is the operator that is

448
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,520
reaching out to the victim

449
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,720
last example with the command version

450
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,400
three which is another backdoor operated

451
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,520
by chiola

452
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,000
and this is a mix between the technical

453
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,039
presented earlier

454
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,760
the public service and emails because it

455
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,480
will use

456
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,880
the gmail web interface to receive

457
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,919
comments and

458
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,200
also extrude data by email

459
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,400
it it choose the web ui so it embeds the

460
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,160
html parser to to parse the inbox and

461
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,360
also the image etc

462
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,280
so generally actual operator

463
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,320
who uses a nozzle main box on a

464
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,360
other free-mate provider such as jmx

465
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,760
to send an email with a specially

466
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,919
crafted attachment

467
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,160
then on the other side comrade with

468
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,200
reach out to

469
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,240
to the same uh dedicated mailbox

470
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,080
so these main boxes are under the full

471
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,679
control of the attacker and they are not

472
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,280
compromised main boxes

473
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,919
so it will connect to the gmail web ui

474
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,240
then parse the html of the mailbox

475
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,720
download the email attachments decrypt

476
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,799
the attachment

477
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,880
and in the attachment there is commands

478
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,559
and then it executes the commands

479
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,720
and send back the the reason by

480
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,760
composing

481
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,840
a message using the gmail web interface

482
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,919
so this is an example of an email from

483
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:16,720
the attacker

484
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,799
you can see that it was sent from the

485
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,919
mx.de

486
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,080
to the gmail address used by comraps

487
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,919
and there is an attachment the

488
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:28,400
document.xls6

489
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,720
which is actually not an excel file this

490
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,160
is just the extension

491
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,480
but it's encrypted robots containing

492
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,480
implements

493
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,880
so uh it's shown in outlook but it's

494
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,559
just for the sake of the example

495
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,280
historically just stay in in gmail

496
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,960
and this is kind of tricky to block

497
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,080
because there are a lot of people

498
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,039
who who tends to to connect to gmail to

499
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,559
consult their uh

500
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,600
their private email from their corporate

501
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,720
computer

502
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,480
also attackers the january

503
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,520
register gmail address using the name

504
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,000
of one of the employee of the compromise

505
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,280
organization

506
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,200
so even if you if you have access to the

507
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,760
full network traffic and you're checking

508
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,400
that

509
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,960
this is a an employee of your

510
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,039
organization you won't realize that it's

511
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,520
actually a mailbox controlled by charles

512
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:35,760
last technique which is dns so

513
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,159
in a typical organization there is like

514
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,559
a ton of dns queries so it's easy to

515
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,440
blend into the

516
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,480
network traffic by using dns to execute

517
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,000
data

518
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,080
also there are some legitimate software

519
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,240
that i that are actually using dns to

520
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,080
transfer data because sometimes

521
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,440
it's faster than using http or any other

522
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,320
network protocol

523
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,559
and no attacker control server is

524
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,080
directly contacted

525
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,159
because like there is dns server that

526
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,080
attacks a proxy between

527
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,360
um the attacker control server and

528
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,559
the victim so it's a bit like dropbox or

529
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,120
imgur that was that were in the middle

530
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,240
and as a defender you won't see

531
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,600
the full chain you you only see like the

532
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,799
first part

533
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,679
uh that means that you are not able to

534
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,320
to

535
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,320
to see that the network control network

536
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,039
resources

537
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,480
is contacted by a victim

538
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,280
um i will show only one example for that

539
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,960
case because

540
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,120
most of the

541
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,480
dns network protocol used by malware are

542
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,840
very similar so my example today is

543
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,840
with invisimore which is an apt group

544
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,039
that is targeting

545
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,039
almost exclusively in ukraine and the

546
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,720
mall are deployed manufacture another

547
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,880
rpg group known as perodo or german

548
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,520
so how does it work a client-infected

549
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,240
machine

550
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,480
we send a dns request with a hidden

551
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,280
message

552
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,840
to a banning dns server so you can see

553
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,960
153.e is a

554
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,360
domain of the attackers and they will

555
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,080
use the

556
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,799
specific subdomains and this subdomain

557
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,640
is generated on the fly because it

558
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,559
contains emphatic data

559
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,679
so when the client

560
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,960
try to resolve this uh these subdomains

561
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,039
it will first contact a beanie banning

562
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,240
dns server

563
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,039
that will then relay the dns request to

564
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,720
the attacker controller name server

565
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,480
but from the defender perspective you

566
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,159
only see the request to the

567
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,960
dns server

568
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,799
also in the

569
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,880
past few months there will be there was

570
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,600
like uh some evolutions with dns

571
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,880
with the introduction of dns over https

572
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,200
which is a new protocol to perform

573
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,000
domain name

574
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,039
resolution over https and it's by

575
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,159
default in firefox

576
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,440
for almost one year the main advantage

577
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,600
for the end user is the encryption

578
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,679
and so the increase of uh of privacy

579
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,120
but uh on the defender perspective there

580
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,799
are some changes

581
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,600
so first to detect cnc communication

582
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,000
that use dns what i've just saw

583
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,240
before you need to actually have

584
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,200
visibility on the dns over https traffic

585
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,960
and it's the same for resolution of

586
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,120
malicious domain because maybe some of

587
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,600
you

588
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,919
rely on dns logs to to check against a

589
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,720
list of non-man none but domain and

590
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,159
check if

591
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,240
some of your machine didn't resolve to

592
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,400
uh to a non-command control server

593
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,200
so it's really important to have visible

594
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,360
on this traffic

595
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,039
and otherwise you'll lose part of the

596
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,840
dns traffic

597
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,360
some mitigations for the

598
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,559
techniques uh i show so first default

599
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,679
block of

600
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,279
low reputation or uncategorized domain

601
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,720
it's also it can also be done

602
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,440
through a custom proxy that has a manual

603
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,960
confirmation or click to access

604
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,240
suspicious domain so

605
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,760
it will break uh malware that don't

606
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,919
implement this this proxy because they

607
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,159
won't be able to interact

608
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,520
with the proxy and then reach out to uh

609
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,200
to the to the commanding control server

610
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,960
matthew uh four minutes left okay

611
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,320
also limit access to historically

612
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,000
unused public service in your

613
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,760
organization so it will limit the

614
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
choices of the attacker

615
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,159
and forcing attackers to use public

616
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:58,880
services

617
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,039
is quite good because then you can

618
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,159
collaborate with

619
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,559
security teams of public services i know

620
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,080
that most of them are very

621
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,039
responsive and if you give them a link

622
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:09,520
to

623
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,520
to a malicious dropbox account or google

624
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,679
docs second they will take it down and

625
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,000
also

626
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,840
earn for related uh reality decants and

627
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,720
block them

628
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,720
so actually it will like destroy part of

629
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,640
attackers resources

630
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,640
so attackers are adapting to the import

631
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,039
improvement of detection methods um

632
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,039
also the main server is very important

633
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,039
as an asset to protect from untold

634
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,480
access as i saw

635
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,440
showed with black neuron if your main

636
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:43,919
server

637
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,360
is used as a main point for command

638
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,480
control communications

639
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,520
and it's kind of game over and you can

640
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,400
take months or years to to arrive that

641
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,799
it's actually compromised

642
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,960
finally if some web services are not

643
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,880
used don't hesitate to block them

644
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,120
thanks for your attention and feel free

645
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,600
to ask questions

646
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,440
thank you matthew it looks like we have

647
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,679
one question in the q a box

648
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,240
from omar interesting presentation do

649
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,880
you see

650
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,240
quick protocol http 3 being used as a

651
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,320
cnc

652
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,840
no i never saw that but

653
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,320
i guess that it's a matter of time

654
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,360
before

655
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,159
some attackers realize that it can be

656
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,039
helpful and

657
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,159
we'll stop to use it

658
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,960
generally they use whatever they can and

659
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,440
whatever is available

660
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,559
especially if people don't check it it's

661
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,399
likely that attacker will start

662
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,760
right just go ahead there's another

663
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,000
question there about doh in the while

664
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
malware using

665
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,360
dns over https

666
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,320
so for drh i never saw myself

667
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,640
malware use it but i saw reports of

668
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
malwares that started doing

669
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,919
using dns over http in the while

670
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,440
so it's a matter of time before

671
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,600
there are more and more and especially

672
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,559
if people don't have visibility on it

673
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,760
it's less likely to to be catch so it's

674
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,640
really important to have visibility on

675
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,799
on this track

676
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,640
maybe we'll do the last two questions

677
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,159
here quickly before we

678
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,200
end the session uh so

679
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,880
malware using telegram yeah go ahead

680
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
yeah for telegram if i remember

681
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,559
correctly there is there was the

682
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,480
uh the uh telebots uh group

683
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,360
we which was uh targeting european which

684
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,120
which was using telegram as command

685
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,240
control server

686
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,520
and as uh telegram is encrypted it might

687
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:51,840
be

688
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,720
a bit of a challenge to um

689
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,679
to to encover suspicious communication

690
