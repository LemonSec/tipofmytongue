1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,120
moderating um please submit your

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,919
questions for

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,680
the q a in the q a section at the bottom

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,679
and questions will be queued in the

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,160
order received

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,599
um so i'd like to welcome

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,920
safa and aaron leverett

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,480
desiree is a security architect for a

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,000
security operations center in the

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,880
financial

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,279
industry and i think her ultimate goal

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,000
is to create

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,760
intelligent processes um

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,640
aaron is a senior scientist at airbus

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,440
operations

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,680
co-author of solving cyber risk and

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,079
founder of vicinity risks

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,200
so the talk is the intelligent process

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,520
life cycle of active cyber defenders and

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,160
last year

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,120
uh jessie uh presented her taxonomy for

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,920
documenting

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,360
and improving a sock user case quality

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,879
it was very interesting and now

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,719
they'll talk about how to bring back

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,320
intelligence to more first level

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,000
security tasks

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,159
uh tasks by extending the concept to

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,000
more uh first level security

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,840
verification disciplines

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,840
we establish the state of security that

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,000
can help you initiate improvement

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,280
steps using in-house information

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,479
and this should be something everybody

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,159
should be interested in so

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,119
take it away thank you very much for the

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:23,920
introduction

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,000
so i'm just gonna quickly start into

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,159
because it's a lot of information that i

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,840
want to transmit here in this short

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,640
presentation

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,479
i'm uh i'm a now principal security

43
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,200
architect

44
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,159
um for the operational part of uh

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,600
finance informatics

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,960
which is a german i.t service provider

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,360
for the german savings banks so we do

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,560
lots of finance stuff

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,040
and i'm aaron leverett joining you from

50
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,720
the lowlands of cambridge instead of the

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,439
highlands

52
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,840
of switzerland and i'm a senior

53
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,600
scientist in cyber innovation which is

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,280
uh you know it sounds like it's a

55
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,200
made-up sort of term but

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,320
basically we do r d and my focus there

57
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,520
is on r d in the risk space

58
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,038
thank you so i'm gonna jump in

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,280
right with where i ended last year so

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,560
for those who haven't seen the

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,239
presentation last year

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,200
um this is gonna add on the taxonomy

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,400
that i published last year

64
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,720
last year all of the information was

65
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,319
pushed to my github

66
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,400
and first actually even sponsored a

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,239
peer-reviewed version of that paper that

68
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:28,640
i

69
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,040
published about two years ago so this

70
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,760
can

71
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,440
all of the links and everything can be

72
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,120
found on that git top

73
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,200
now last year i presented those eight

74
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,360
categories and my main goal was

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,239
to make security monitoring a little bit

76
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,640
easier on the analysts and to show where

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,040
their problems were coming from because

78
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,959
lots of the alerts that the analysts you

79
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,959
get are like coming from everywhere

80
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,360
and they divided it by if it was caused

81
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,519
by a process problem or a configuration

82
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,080
problem

83
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,440
if the stock can actually do something

84
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,280
about it or if some

85
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,760
member of the company an engineer for

86
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,599
example needs to do some adjustments

87
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,519
and i wanted to get some quality results

88
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,440
on how the products are actually working

89
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:07,920
and

90
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,680
of course the most important ones were

91
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,840
the confirmed attack with fire actions

92
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,680
and the confirmed attack attempt without

93
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,599
the ir actions which pretty much means

94
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,280
that they accepted the risk that you

95
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,120
don't go further with the alerts

96
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,159
at hackaloo i presented the

97
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,640
kpis or some kpis that i would suggest

98
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,840
that we could take

99
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,319
from those tech from this taxonomy and

100
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,799
this talk was also recorded the link

101
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,599
can be found on the github as well and

102
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,760
at cybercrimecon from group ib

103
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,080
i went on and created some external

104
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,400
thread heat map which is actually based

105
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,959
on only the confirmed attack um with ir

106
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,400
actions and the confirmed attack

107
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
attempts without ir action so pretty

108
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,280
much what you should be seeing from

109
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,360
outside and it was combined with some

110
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,799
mighty attack techniques

111
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,120
and critic from the criticality sorted

112
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,480
and i also

113
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,159
created those internal security heat

114
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,720
maps which were more based on the

115
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
internal stuff that is going wrong so

116
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,480
unannounced admin actions

117
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,480
and detection device rule configuration

118
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,400
errors all of that kind of stuff

119
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,439
so now we have this update and

120
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,439
this is pretty much caused by the

121
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,720
reasoned and well we all have been going

122
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,839
more towards cloud

123
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,560
and um after um hackaloo i was

124
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,199
approached to actually

125
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,960
translate this whole taxonomy

126
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,840
to compliance and integrity monitoring

127
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,600
just to make sure that we can also

128
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,320
see the configuration of such devices

129
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,960
and

130
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,520
i'm still convinced that detection of

131
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,280
configuration changes especially in the

132
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,440
cloud are also very important

133
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,600
and the stock service quality reflects

134
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
overall security quality of state so

135
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,479
i mean if if the stock is the one place

136
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,080
where you get all of the alerts from all

137
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,520
of the company of the things that are

138
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,400
going wrong

139
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,240
and if i'm looking at the last few years

140
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,520
it doesn't look like we

141
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,639
like we did get less to do so what i

142
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,440
actually did

143
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,160
i didn't only translate it to the

144
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,919
integrity and compliance monitoring but

145
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,440
i also looked at vulnerability

146
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,320
management and

147
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,320
what is actually going wrong there

148
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,759
because i'm still convinced that this

149
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,600
was already put in the last presentation

150
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,560
last year

151
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,639
that the stock is really the place where

152
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,160
you see all the errors and things that

153
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,960
are going wrong

154
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,240
and if you don't want to screw all the

155
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,800
analysts then you should be making sure

156
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,360
that they can articulate their problems

157
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,960
in the right way

158
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,840
so this is sort of where um where i came

159
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,039
into the story

160
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,080
uh briefly like um uh desiree had done

161
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,280
all this great work and

162
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,479
you can go back and view some of that

163
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,680
older work but if you haven't seen it

164
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,280
before we're gonna present some new

165
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,160
things here

166
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,840
and the gist of it was that she had done

167
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,199
this great work uh

168
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,720
making a taxonomy for all these

169
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,800
different categories of things that can

170
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
and do go wrong and then she was mapping

171
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,600
that into risk

172
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,199
and i i know that a lot of people

173
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,080
traditionally have viewed risk as

174
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,000
a subset of compliance but i want to

175
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,280
encourage you to think about this the

176
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,319
other way around

177
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,400
compliance is one tool for managing

178
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,840
risks and it's certainly not the only

179
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,479
one

180
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,160
i personally got into risk because i was

181
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,319
tired of viewing risk as only a kind of

182
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,479
compliance exercise so one of the things

183
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,600
we're going to do today

184
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,199
is as we go through some of the

185
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,880
taxonomies and some of the details

186
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,639
we're going to try and map those to

187
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,919
risks and treatments

188
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,000
and and clarify some of that stuff about

189
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,960
risk

190
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,759
thank you aaron yes so what i created

191
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,680
and what was last week posted on github

192
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,479
already

193
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,319
is this poster and it looks really

194
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,840
messy probably for many people that

195
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,280
haven't looked at it a little bit in

196
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,400
detail but it should

197
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,319
display all of the categories that i

198
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,520
would came up with

199
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,840
for false positives states and error

200
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,280
types and problems

201
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,560
and you pretty much see the categories

202
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,160
for integrity compliance configuration

203
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,919
monitoring the ones for security event

204
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,600
and incident management so the

205
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,680
security monitoring part as well as the

206
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,120
vulnerability and it was

207
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,360
heavily based i tried to include the

208
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,120
continuous improvement action in this

209
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,840
poster

210
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,960
so the colors um actually should

211
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,880
highlight on where the next action

212
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,319
should be going and this

213
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,639
pretty much was caused because taking

214
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,840
errors for everything would have been

215
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,880
really messy

216
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,919
so yeah but um the focus really is on

217
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,680
this continuous improvement because if

218
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,000
we

219
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,759
highlight and have these categories we

220
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,599
can always go to a next step

221
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,440
and what i tried to include as well was

222
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,039
this paper published by

223
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,120
lockheed martin like a while ago the

224
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,639
intelligence-driven computer network

225
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,240
defense informed by analyzers of

226
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,360
adversity campaigns

227
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,560
and intrusion chains so this

228
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
um pretty much they just say that

229
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,319
everything that you try to

230
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,199
um if you can't prevent it try to detect

231
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,080
it at least

232
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,919
and you should always make sure that if

233
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,759
you can't deny the

234
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,440
action completely then you should at

235
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,000
least try to degrade disrupt deceive it

236
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
and if you can't detect it you might be

237
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,120
able to discover it so

238
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,560
just make sure that you always have one

239
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,919
of these actions covered so the

240
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:48,879
reference link

241
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,039
goes to the details but i found this

242
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,000
paper really helpful and interesting

243
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,720
so i'm jumping right into just because

244
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
of the time running

245
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,160
this is the categories that i came up

246
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,680
with for integrity and compliance

247
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,120
configuration monitoring

248
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,560
and in this presentation i only added

249
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,240
the follow-up actions

250
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,520
because um really for time-saving issues

251
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,800
and all of this

252
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,759
is already put into a paper like the

253
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,720
last one so

254
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,479
it's pretty similar and also from the

255
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,240
whole way that i created it

256
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,639
and um so on the github you do find

257
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,639
detailed explanation of what every

258
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,680
category is

259
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,120
and how this can be used

260
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,440
and um so for example if you have a

261
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,120
legit violation with mischanged

262
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,760
documentation your follow-up action will

263
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,679
be adjust baseline configuration and

264
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,799
document the change

265
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,039
if you have a configuration error in the

266
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,919
baseline

267
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,919
you your engineer probably needs to

268
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,360
review the baseline

269
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
and go on with that so this is pretty

270
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,800
much the category it's divided again

271
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
in company problems and what can the

272
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,080
stock soul

273
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,000
resolve themselves and what are the

274
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,680
strategic values that you want to get

275
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,320
from it

276
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,640
so this is pretty much the framework

277
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,080
that you should already know from the

278
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,440
last publication

279
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
so i will just go on and jump to the

280
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,519
next wheel

281
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,120
and this is the one from vulnerability

282
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,040
management and

283
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,760
vulnerability management is not only i

284
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,560
mean

285
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,880
if you see this from a perspective of a

286
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,480
sock that is not only

287
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,399
doing services for an internal company

288
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,000
but also for an external one

289
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,440
you usually have a word that is

290
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,880
vulnerability scanner in place that

291
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,560
tells you this is an alert and

292
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,160
or this is a vulnerability that should

293
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
be fixed and

294
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,320
um you will most likely get one of those

295
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,080
two responses here you get either that

296
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,360
the vulnerability verification is

297
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,240
mistaken

298
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,519
so your scanner is apparently wrong or

299
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,200
you will get context of the

300
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,040
exploitability is not given eskim

301
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,760
is not given so you have like it's not

302
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,880
actually a problem because your

303
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,640
vulnerability scanner doesn't look at it

304
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,000
at the right angle and you probably have

305
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,680
like a woof or something in between and

306
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,120
you're behind the woof so

307
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,480
it's not a problem well yeah

308
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,600
this is very well possible but um you

309
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,440
should be documenting those things and

310
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,720
what are the responses that you're

311
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,440
getting

312
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,040
and um we are here still with

313
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,880
vulnerability if it was relevant if

314
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,640
they're now with no it wasn't relevant

315
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,000
but if it was irrelevant

316
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,079
then you still have the possibility that

317
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,079
it can't be prevented on time so you

318
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:16,880
always want

319
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,720
want to make sure can you take some

320
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
actions like

321
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,680
right on time or if you can't fulfill

322
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,519
the time then you want to make sure that

323
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,800
you find some other

324
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,000
steps that you can do and um

325
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,839
aaron do you want to jump in on that or

326
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,680
i will sure yeah

327
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,680
yeah the um i think the point here is

328
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,360
that we all know that that

329
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,000
sock workers and defenders of networks

330
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,279
are exhausted they're working really

331
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,839
hard

332
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,279
so if you're scanning for all of these

333
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,560
different vulnerabilities and you're

334
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,320
continually getting pushback saying oh

335
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,000
this one doesn't apply because we have a

336
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,440
waff or because we have

337
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,959
this other mitigation or we're catching

338
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,560
that in the ids or whatever

339
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,959
that's still a question of your scope uh

340
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,640
not being useful

341
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,560
because you don't need to scan for these

342
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,480
things if the context is being discarded

343
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,399
on a more permanent basis

344
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,839
or you might want to scan for them

345
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,079
because you're looking for

346
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,399
when the waff stops working for example

347
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,839
and those are great reasons to do these

348
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,079
things but you still need to document

349
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,600
why you made those decisions and what's

350
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,360
going on this is particularly important

351
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
when you're a sock that's dealing with

352
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,800
multiple stakeholders

353
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,079
because you know your teams are

354
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,680
exhausted they're working really hard

355
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,880
and this this is where

356
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,640
um you know dez is a really smart lady

357
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,760
and she's done all this great work i

358
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,040
want to make it clear that this project

359
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,800
is very much her project but that's

360
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,360
where

361
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,800
our conversation started to get

362
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,959
interesting because she would say to me

363
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,640
you know oh this is this is the risk and

364
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,680
this is the treatment

365
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,040
and i'd start thinking about it and i'd

366
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,560
realize that you know there was a lot

367
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,160
going on here in terms of risk

368
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,680
some of which we'll capture a bit later

369
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,600
but the main one there is the sort of

370
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,040
strategic risk of

371
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,720
well vulnerabilities are going out and

372
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,079
if we have more vulnerabilities that's

373
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,440
going to be more patches and more

374
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,639
patches is more

375
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,320
patch management right and i think

376
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,600
everyone's exhausted with that at the

377
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,959
moment and that's why

378
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,240
we need to start thinking about some of

379
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,600
these things and gathering data on some

380
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,800
of these things so i'll let

381
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,120
let dez move on and i'll just uh uh

382
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,959
occasionally chime in to

383
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,240
make a few points towards the end

384
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,320
perfect good

385
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,040
so if we can't install the patch on time

386
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,560
or the engineers actually

387
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,880
then we usually get like one of those

388
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,639
four problems usually just

389
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,560
orally and they don't document it in

390
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,480
another way so if it's a resource

391
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,639
problem they usually don't have stuffing

392
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,680
issues

393
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,680
or budget other priorities and you

394
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,200
should be documenting this

395
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,360
um if you have a compatibility problem

396
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,839
so this usually means that your product

397
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,200
the patch can't be installed on that

398
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,279
version that you have um installed or if

399
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,880
there's some other kind of problem you

400
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,480
want to document in it because that's

401
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,600
actually a risk

402
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,320
if you do have a bad sla with a bad sla

403
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,800
i mean

404
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,040
that you do have an sla in place that

405
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,279
for example for the network engineers

406
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,680
only allows them to install a patch like

407
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,880
four times a year

408
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,680
and they just don't have any way on how

409
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,519
they can install this patch on time for

410
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:53,839
you

411
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,519
that's something you want to document

412
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,839
because the more facts you create with

413
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,480
this

414
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,600
statistics the more um information you

415
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,120
afterwards have to actually argue

416
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,959
against slas or find out

417
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,279
if there can or should be a contract

418
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,440
adjusted for this

419
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,680
and with the support problem i go

420
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
towards partner dependencies if your

421
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,240
partner

422
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,920
or if the partner that you have the

423
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,000
product from is not delivering you with

424
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,279
a patch

425
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,120
and you can't fix the vulnerability you

426
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,440
should be documenting this as well so

427
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,720
all of this will be very important just

428
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,600
towards more greater risks but we get to

429
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,079
that afterwards with the kpis as well

430
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,839
um aaron yeah this is this is a this is

431
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,680
a perfect example of where my curiosity

432
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,560
was peaked right

433
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,800
um so dez was talking to me about how

434
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,600
these these

435
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,680
uh requirements on the sock were to scan

436
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,199
for something and then

437
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,639
you see that you've scanned for it and

438
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,760
you asked them to repair the

439
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,720
vulnerability

440
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,160
but they don't have enough downtime

441
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,560
window to actually do that and that's uh

442
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,399
what you know in economics or risk we

443
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,079
might call conflicting incentives or

444
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,519
perverse incentives

445
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,199
where two different sides of your own

446
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,800
organization in other words

447
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,639
the the salespeople who are negotiating

448
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,399
the contracts and the slas

449
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,959
are now in conflict with your sock

450
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,000
support team

451
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and that is really funny but it's the

452
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,279
kind of thing that we see happen all the

453
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,480
time and it's really interesting because

454
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,519
your sock team's

455
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,959
getting exhausted constantly finding

456
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,240
these risks and then no one's treating

457
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,959
these risks

458
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,639
and it doesn't usually occur to you to

459
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,720
go hey should we look at the slas

460
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,800
and should we find out if the slas have

461
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,160
a provision

462
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,760
for how much downtime is available

463
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,360
there's no point in us asking them to

464
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,199
fix more than they can fix according to

465
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,720
the same contract

466
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,120
and then by changing those contracts you

467
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,199
can realign those incentives and often

468
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,800
when you realign the incentives

469
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,480
you realign the risks and one of the

470
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,760
things that i think many people forget

471
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,959
about risk is

472
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,480
yes it can be mathematical and

473
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,880
relatively objective but it's often very

474
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,959
subjective in the sense that the sock

475
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,399
is facing the risk from a different

476
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,160
angle than the customer

477
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,320
and until you align that view of risk

478
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,519
inside a contract

479
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,120
you're going to have these conflicts so

480
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,720
i guess our point is when you see these

481
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,160
these really interesting entrenched

482
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,000
debates within your organization

483
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
look for a realignment of incentives to

484
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,440
help you solve some of those problems

485
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:03,760
and

486
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,680
and the solution might not just be

487
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,360
writing more intrusion detection rules

488
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,959
or something in engineering you might

489
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:09,519
have to

490
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,880
get out of your comfort zone and go and

491
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,000
speak to some other people in the

492
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,199
organization

493
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,920
yes yeah because security isn't only

494
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,199
your job but like

495
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,680
there's some governance and security

496
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,440
management team and they have a part and

497
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,959
a role as well

498
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,920
so when we went on and we couldn't uh

499
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,959
just

500
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,440
deny the whole thing happening or have

501
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,600
some other way of degrading the attack

502
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,560
we at least want to try to detect it or

503
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,519
discover it

504
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,680
and if you can create a detection it's

505
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,839
usually via a security monitoring rule

506
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,160
or

507
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,079
more integrity compliance configuration

508
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,160
monitoring or even some hunting action

509
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,560
or you increase visibility by adjusting

510
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,759
some other configuration in the

511
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,360
background so you can do something about

512
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,839
it

513
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,800
but if you can't you usually also have a

514
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,560
few things that go wrong

515
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,360
and um the first four categories here

516
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,040
events cannot be locked detection

517
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,240
pattern unclear

518
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,000
lock event ratio and reasonable resource

519
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,759
problems are usually the ones that i

520
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,519
will point most to the sock

521
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,680
because i think the other people can't

522
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,519
do something about it

523
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,160
so um events cannot be locked is usually

524
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
this is a very specific attack

525
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,000
and then you don't know yet how to

526
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,519
detect a specific attack

527
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,759
and then you need to find a close enough

528
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,279
approximate

529
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,759
approximation and this can very well be

530
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,360
that this means more overhead in your

531
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,639
team as well so

532
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,040
um you need to find out if this is

533
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
actually a good way or if you

534
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,800
in this case just want to say that the

535
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,399
events cannot be locked in

536
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,680
an efficient matter you want to say

537
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,519
if the detection pattern is unclear i

538
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,040
would usually say that

539
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,600
it's probably more an education problem

540
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,279
that they don't know how to detect it

541
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,519
but it can also be and i don't want to

542
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,120
point this only to the analyst but i

543
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,440
mean

544
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,959
if not even the analysts can get it

545
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,120
right nobody else in the company will

546
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,160
so if you don't know how to detect it

547
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
you should be documenting it and take it

548
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,759
as a risk

549
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,240
um then the log event ratio is

550
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,319
unreasonable that's a really economic

551
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,119
problem so

552
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,599
you might want to verify if there's more

553
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,599
economic alternatives but you might not

554
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,319
be able to

555
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,880
please document that this is not in the

556
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,520
current

557
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,079
way you have your setup reasonably

558
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,640
doable

559
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,119
so um this is a different kind of

560
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,640
problem than the others

561
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,000
and with a resource problem at the

562
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,160
detection point it's really that your

563
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,880
stop stock stuff is has like different

564
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,160
priorities or you

565
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
just have too little and you should be

566
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,600
documenting this as well

567
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,760
and this is also some kind of risk is if

568
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,200
all of the soccer employees

569
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,320
are too busy with other things um you

570
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,480
want to document this

571
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,400
so yeah then the other categories

572
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,280
are more towards the middle one the like

573
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,880
locks cannot be delivered and research

574
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,320
problem in delivery is usually the

575
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,200
engineers

576
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,120
something in the transmission way

577
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,039
towards you is going wrong

578
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,160
so um it's probably a firewall rule that

579
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,840
you can't adjust and it can even be that

580
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,760
it's your partner at some other site

581
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,679
that is not doing the change so it might

582
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,960
just be that it's not you

583
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,880
but you should be reporting that logs

584
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,559
cannot be delivered to you and this is

585
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,799
why you can't create a detection

586
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,200
and if there's other people having

587
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,039
resource problems that's also something

588
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,400
you want to report a risk to

589
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,320
i mean those people then need to verify

590
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,840
their priorities

591
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,960
and their way they are set up and you

592
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,880
should be documenting it because the

593
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,080
worst thing that can happen

594
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,799
is that someone something happens and

595
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,559
someone comes to you afterwards and

596
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,400
tells you you didn't create a detection

597
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,880
and you didn't document why you couldn't

598
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,320
create the detection

599
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,360
because you have actually tried it

600
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,320
and the last few points here are no tool

601
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,640
for logging is available or no process

602
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,400
demand and responsible for the detection

603
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,120
is available

604
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,520
which is usually a government problem so

605
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,280
security management somebody

606
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,280
in an overall state probably also

607
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,880
security architecture

608
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,200
just didn't think of creating such a

609
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,799
possibility to create to

610
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,880
get those tools in there and this locks

611
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,480
that you need and so

612
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,160
this usually can't be resolved by the

613
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,400
sock themselves so document it

614
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,919
so they do get the data to create such

615
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,360
detections um i would

616
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,559
go on because we want to go to the kpis

617
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,919
and the benefits

618
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,160
um i created a few kpis again

619
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,640
um like the last time for now technical

620
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,080
security compliance monitoring and

621
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,600
integrity monitoring

622
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,320
um so for example um we have here a

623
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,679
number of legitimate

624
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,919
violations authorized by change you do

625
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,200
see that

626
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,600
if you have an alert in the stock and it

627
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,720
was actually

628
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,640
authorized by a change by official

629
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,320
change management process that was in

630
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,039
place

631
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,720
this means the stock wasn't included in

632
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
that process and

633
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,200
that's a process problem you want to fix

634
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,679
and

635
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,240
make sure that you are not running after

636
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,440
things and

637
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,200
always because this really should be

638
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,679
like stopped at the beginning

639
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,600
um if you more have like configuration

640
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,120
errors in the baseline

641
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,919
um then it means that the quality of the

642
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,520
security baselines that you have

643
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,120
is probably not that good so you want to

644
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,960
create statistics of that as well

645
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,039
a number of limitations and verification

646
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,640
products found

647
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,840
means that your product that you're

648
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,080
using is probably not that good

649
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,400
so you want to have a look at it as well

650
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,120
um

651
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,600
if you create statistics on it you can

652
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,520
get the facts to

653
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,280
like create the changes that you need in

654
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,720
your infrastructure

655
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,960
and number of activities with no change

656
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,880
required this is a hard one

657
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,120
i mean if no one actually asked to

658
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,919
document

659
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,600
something some change that is done in

660
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,679
the infrastructure so for example if in

661
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,440
the cloud the configuration is changed

662
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,120
and nobody cares the documented

663
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,720
interchange where you could verify it

664
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,919
with you have no

665
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,000
chance of making sure that this was

666
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,840
actually an official change

667
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,520
and this means that the stock is running

668
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,120
after security problems

669
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,280
that apparently the governance team and

670
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,960
security management doesn't think is a

671
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,000
problem because they

672
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,720
never defined the scope to be covering

673
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,760
that areas

674
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,480
so make sure that the security

675
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,200
management

676
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,440
and the governance people know what

677
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,559
should be covered

678
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,640
and if they don't think it's reasonable

679
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,919
to cover it then

680
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,840
i don't i would really question if you

681
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,360
as a stock need to run after those

682
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,400
events

683
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,440
and the last event this is um yes

684
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,039
hey go ahead if you want you can go

685
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,720
through the rest of the slide i was just

686
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,760
gonna

687
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,280
yeah no i wanted to say that the number

688
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,880
of only price changes without legitimate

689
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,159
costs is pretty much

690
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,039
one kpi where you afterwards get a

691
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:31,919
security

692
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,679
incident from because this is the one

693
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,760
that stuff that you can't verify and

694
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,240
that you need to further analyze

695
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,120
now aaron sorry

696
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,480
no problem no problem it's a little

697
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,840
harder when we're not in person we can't

698
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,240
make any uh eye contact as easily so

699
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,400
um yeah this is a good opportunity to

700
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,240
say you know here's an operational risk

701
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,600
right like if you're

702
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
uh you're performing these actions and

703
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,280
you are detecting these things and no

704
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,960
one has ownership of it in your

705
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,120
organization or in another organization

706
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,120
that's an operational risk because

707
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,360
you're not blind to the risk but your

708
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,720
your hands are tied in the sense that

709
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,240
the organization isn't reacting to

710
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,880
anything

711
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,240
and that's a that's a big difference

712
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,240
than a a compliance risk right because

713
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,840
you're looking for someone to own that

714
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,440
risk and do something about it

715
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,520
also you have policy risks uh which

716
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,480
might be you know the

717
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,760
failure of the policy or the way the

718
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,520
policy is designed or the slas that we

719
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,960
talked about earlier

720
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,159
this is a good opportunity to talk about

721
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,000
endogenous and exogenous risk and i know

722
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,960
many of you

723
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,880
will already know what those are but and

724
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,240
keep in mind that first is a very

725
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,760
international organization

726
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,840
some of our non-native english speakers

727
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,200
may not have encountered these ideas

728
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,760
before

729
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
so endogenous is a risk that is inside

730
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,360
the organization that flows from the way

731
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,400
the organization

732
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,320
does things i'll use the earth as a

733
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,640
metaphor volcanoes are an endogenous

734
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,240
risk they happen on earth they're part

735
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,440
of the earth's processes

736
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,600
an exogenous risk is one that comes from

737
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,960
outside the organization

738
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
and usually is is a big surprise right

739
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
so like a meteor striking the earth

740
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,880
would be an exogenous risk there's not

741
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,799
really something inside the way we're

742
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:01,600
behaving

743
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,360
that we can do to change that now that

744
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,120
doesn't mean that you can't treat

745
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,960
an exogenous risk it just means that the

746
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,559
way you treat it is usually a bit

747
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,440
different

748
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,360
and the way you detect it is definitely

749
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,720
different because

750
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,400
to be able to see it coming you need to

751
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,320
be outward facing a lot of times in risk

752
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,120
we talk about

753
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,600
inside out risk and outside in risk so

754
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,400
most people

755
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,919
i think they think of the inside out

756
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,080
model where i'm an organization

757
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,840
i map my different risks to different

758
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,280
things and i try and keep track of

759
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,240
different treatments

760
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,840
but there's also that outside end view

761
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,600
where i'm looking outwardly to figure

762
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,120
out what risks are coming my way and

763
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,960
which ones are exogenous

764
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,919
so that's uh that's a useful paradigm to

765
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:38,799
help you think about some of these

766
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,559
things sometimes the solution might be

767
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,720
uh under the things you control and then

768
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,919
indulge in a sense

769
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,320
or it might be in the way you do

770
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,520
business with your business partners or

771
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
the way you interact with your

772
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,360
supply chain or the the ways that you um

773
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,960
make the requirements in the software

774
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,440
that you use um so just because the risk

775
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,760
is

776
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
exogenous doesn't mean you can't do

777
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,120
anything about it

778
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,880
um do you want to move on to the next

779
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,159
slide and we'll yeah

780
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,559
i guess we also have five minutes yeah

781
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,240
five more minutes so we have a few more

782
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,960
kpis

783
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,720
uh for vulnerability management pretty

784
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,480
much and those are

785
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,000
like i'm coming back now to number of

786
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,080
delays due to unreasonable slash i mean

787
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,799
this is really something you want to

788
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,679
like create into statistics so you might

789
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,120
want to do something in the organization

790
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,640
about else you will always have

791
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,559
engineers fighting against each other's

792
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,559
and this is just not good gonna be the

793
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,720
resolution or the solution for this all

794
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
and the number of delays due to resource

795
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,799
problems or average delays

796
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,360
until um things can be resolved this is

797
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,720
also very important i mean

798
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,880
if you're just not having just staff the

799
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,919
way it should be

800
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,679
this is an overall risk that should be

801
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,600
checked and it's probably more on a

802
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,360
contractual level

803
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,080
um yes so the other things are pretty

804
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,279
clear i would say

805
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,120
aaron do you have um something you want

806
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,559
to add elsa would go

807
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,760
to next slide elf because

808
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,880
we're running short yeah sure

809
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,159
just go ahead and move on to the next

810
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,840
and don't forget to launch the poll at

811
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,039
some point when you're ready

812
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,320
oh true yeah so um the goal really was

813
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,080
identify where time is actually being

814
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,600
spent create statistics for

815
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,039
effectiveness of internal security

816
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:13,679
measures and

817
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,679
architecture so you can have an

818
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,279
evidence-based discussion

819
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,960
and integrate the possibility for

820
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,559
directly initiating continuous

821
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,000
improvement into the process if you

822
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,840
actually are automating all of those

823
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,200
kind of things in the background so

824
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,840
that is a really nice side feature

825
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,679
and this one is about the value at risk

826
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,919
right

827
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,919
yeah so like looking at those contracts

828
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,360
can be helpful to you as well because

829
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,080
you might see

830
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,120
the amount of money that your

831
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,360
organization is making from those things

832
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,200
and how much weight you put on

833
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,559
you know the detection of particular

834
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,520
particular vulnerabilities for

835
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,120
particular clients for example

836
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,960
so understanding that value at risk even

837
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,400
if you're just an everyday engineer

838
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,080
tells you why do we spend so much time

839
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,840
as a stock doing this job as opposed to

840
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,559
that job

841
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,400
and it might be a lot to do with revenue

842
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,520
and and how that revenue is being

843
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,320
generated or

844
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,200
how the value at risk is working um this

845
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,600
also

846
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,679
helps you get a little more transparency

847
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,960
in your risk treatments

848
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,279
so you don't you know when we were

849
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,799
talking about defense in depth earlier

850
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,240
we had a great big list of all the

851
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,679
things that we might like to do deny

852
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:16,480
degrade

853
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
etc and the idea is that you want to do

854
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,840
all of these things and that's that's

855
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,039
great in theory that's like

856
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,200
you know people who have no um they have

857
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,880
an infinite amount of money in their

858
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,320
bank account and they can spend it on

859
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,279
everything they want

860
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,880
i don't live in that world i'm sure you

861
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,400
don't live in that world so

862
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,159
um the point here is how much money and

863
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,760
how much time should we put into each of

864
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,559
those things

865
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,840
and we'd like to both reduce the

866
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,600
severity and the frequency

867
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,960
and then of course you know you can find

868
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,480
these things out by by checking the

869
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,240
contracts or other

870
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,720
um other things it might be that your

871
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,080
customers have a particular value at

872
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,000
risk if you don't meet a certain metric

873
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,600
and so they might be determining the

874
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,120
value at risk and you might need to see

875
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,600
that

876
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,120
not inside your own organization but

877
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,039
inside another one and i think

878
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,120
um now's a good time to hand back to

879
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,480
desiree to wrap things up

880
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,520
and maybe take questions and do the poll

881
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,760
yes we have two minutes two questions

882
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,880
and the poll

883
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,840
yes perfect so um just activate the poll

884
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,320
because

885
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,799
um this is pretty much um i created this

886
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,559
poster i created

887
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,440
um the integrity compliance paper

888
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,080
already and

889
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,840
aaron and i are planning to write

890
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,120
another paper about all of the

891
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,399
vulnerability section

892
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,799
but what forma would you most appreciate

893
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,840

895
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,200
include this in the next steps

896
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,120
um just so we know

897
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,840
