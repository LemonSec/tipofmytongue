1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,560
uh again i'm acting as the session

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,319
moderator uh you won't hear too much

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,160
from me here along the way my only ask

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,879
is that you

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,679
do please utilize the q a functionality

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,599
at the bottom of your screen

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,759
to ask any questions of our presenter

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,080
with that i have the the privilege of

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,920
handling handing a floor over to

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,080
dr paul vixie he's currently the

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,000
chairman ceo co-founder of

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,640
farsight security and he's here to talk

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,680
to us today about

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,119
deploying dns over https

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,480
without confrontation dr vixi over to

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,680
you sir

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,160
thank you mike thank you all for uh

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,920
coming by

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,280
there are many stages of grief when i

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,079
gave a talk related to this topic in

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,280
edinburgh

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,559
i think that was anger and i may be in

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,680
negotiation now uh so let me bring you

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,520
up to speed as to

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,359
uh what this is you know silver https

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,760
is part of something uh and try and

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,879
explain why

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,040
it the default is confrontational

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,680
and then what we might be able to do on

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,200
a sort of network by network basis to

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,040
sort of adopt this future or a version

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,040
of this future

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,119
so let me march right in some of this

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,240
will be

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,400
old hat to those of you who have

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,560
followed the bouncing ball of my dns

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,200
wars talk

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,320
first let's talk about the dns system

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,079
architecture this has not really changed

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,560
in the 30 plus years of dns operation

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,680
we've been using

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,079
stub resolvers in our hosts that now

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,680
include smartphones

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,640
laptops virtual servers etc and we've

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,479
got authority servers

46
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,600
which is tends to be bind or

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,680
not or something like that but there are

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,119
a lot of different ways

49
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,520
to get data into the system but whatever

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,439
you're doing whether it's a zone file or

51
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,079
a

52
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,320
program or a database whatever it is

53
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,520
that

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,280
from dns's point of view that is an

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,520
authority server so you have questions

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,160
coming in

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
from the bottom coming from users

58
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
applications

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,480
answers coming in from the top they meet

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,280
in the middle

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,840
that thing that i'm calling the

62
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,520
recursive server which is also known as

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,040
a full resolver

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,560
for reasons which don't concern us

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,920
now some of the things you have to know

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,800
about why this works and why it works

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
this way

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,800
are first that the conversations between

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,239
the stub resolvers that's your

70
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,280
smartphone

71
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,920
and the recursive server which might be

72
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,360
8.8.8.8 if it's google or

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,920
might be whatever your enterprise or isp

74
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,319
has assigned you

75
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,800
that conversation since it contains your

76
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,920
ip address

77
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,080
and connects your ip address to every

78
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,440
question you ask

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,840
it is deeply pii personally identifiable

80
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,879
information

81
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,040
so you really want to keep that data

82
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640
path

83
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,879
on a close hold you only want to send

84
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,040
your queries to someone you trust

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,200
to hold your pii or to not hold your pii

86
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,159
but whatever

87
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,080
it is someone you trust someone who's

88
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,000
under the same legal regime

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,120
uh possibly somebody who is uh under

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,440
contract of some kind like an isp

91
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,040
or perhaps you're running the server

92
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,799
yourself there have been

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,360
open source recursive server

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,799
implementations

95
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,200
for the entire lifetime of the dns going

96
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,280
back to the mid-1980s

97
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,599
and not all of them were as high quality

98
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,120
as those of today but then

99
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,360
it's always been possible to run your

100
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,720
own

101
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,440
um finally let me say that the reason

102
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,280
this system has scaled is because of

103
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,120
that cash on the left

104
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,680
where if someone else who shares that

105
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,760
recursive server with you has recently

106
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,840
asked the same question you're asking

107
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,000
you will get a very fast response which

108
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,840
will be a copy of the response

109
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,760
that somebody else caused to be fetched

110
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,400
and that's how we got eight nine orders

111
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,840
of magnitude

112
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,959
out of a single architecture so

113
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,600
very simple very impressive doesn't

114
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,680
really

115
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,560
explain its own wow function because it

116
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,520
works it works so well

117
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,280
after commercialization and

118
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,000
privatization when it became possible to

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,960
purchase

120
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,639
internet service from an isp this is

121
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,919
kind of the system topology

122
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,440
so roughly speaking at y2k

123
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,240
your users and applications are you know

124
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,919
connected somehow to a lan

125
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,040
maybe it's wi-fi uh maybe it's a wired

126
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,840
ethernet

127
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,080
i can i don't know bluetooth personal

128
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,520
area network whatever it is

129
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,360
you've got to connect somehow to the

130
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,960
internet and you're going to do that

131
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,720
through a local area network that then

132
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,880
might be part of a campus

133
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,520
or a building or something else then it

134
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,759
has a connection to some isp or maybe

135
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,800
more than one

136
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,280
and that isp's job is to connect you to

137
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,400
the internet

138
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,120
uh and that kind of again that that kind

139
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,080
of worked

140
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,600
uh otherwise we wouldn't be talking

141
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,680
about the internet so much today

142
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,280
um now i've heard the aphorism that

143
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,880
money changes everything but

144
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,759
actually it's only true because money is

145
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,360
power and power is what changes

146
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,720
everything

147
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,240
so let me show you some of the steps i'm

148
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,840
going to summarize this as

149
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,280
briefly as i can that got us to

150
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
encrypted dns in general and doh in

151
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,280
particular

152
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,360
first in y2k there was an attempt to put

153
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,080
a wildcard at star.com

154
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,000
and what a wild card means is there are

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,600
no negative answers

156
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,720
and that meant that for a brief time

157
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,800
before the lawsuit started and before

158
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,960
those were concluded

159
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,440
you no matter what question you ask if

160
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,600
it ended in dot com you got an answer a

161
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,960
positive answer

162
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,880
and this caused a lot of trouble but it

163
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,479
was ultimately

164
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,440
a revenue enhancement play by the

165
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,479
registry4.com which was verisign they

166
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,600
had a partner called

167
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,120
sitefinder that they were using to

168
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,000
derive ad revenue from those positive

169
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,319
but

170
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,759
falsely positive responses so this was

171
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,360
hugely controversial and it

172
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,720
ended in tears and ultimately

173
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,759
went away but it helped set the stage

174
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,000
for

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,840
what came later which is dns was

176
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,520
uh sexy and dns was a way that you could

177
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,039
advance your own

178
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,479
innovation and uh maybe shift some costs

179
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,160
but one way or another

180
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,639
answering questions privately and

181
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,720
without drama

182
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,240
has become a little more rare so around

183
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,800
the middle

184
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
of the first decade of of this new

185
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,720
century opendns

186
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,039
said you know you don't need to use your

187
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,720
isp name server you don't need to run

188
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,240
your own you can use ours

189
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
and they had a pretty reliable service

190
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,720
that it was present in many cities

191
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,680
through

192
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,800
ip anycast and

193
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
the way that they decided they were

194
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,319
going to pay for this was with

195
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,400
nx domain redirection in other words the

196
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,479
same thing verisign had done a few years

197
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,120
later

198
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,440
but done in the middle of our

199
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,280
architecture at the recursive server

200
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,360
rather than being done at the top

201
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
either way you're trying to sell ads by

202
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,479
giving people

203
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,000
falsely positive answers

204
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,360
even if what they asked for didn't exist

205
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,199
this didn't raise too many eyebrows

206
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,840
until they decided to redirect

207
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,039
www.google

208
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,840
to an open dns search page because they

209
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,680
treated that as the search utility and

210
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,440
they just wanted to offer their own

211
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,039
and it wasn't really their own they

212
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,039
redirected all of those

213
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,120
uh search queries to google but it gave

214
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
them a chance to data mine the answers

215
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,199
and date or student data mine the

216
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,599
questions they could then associate with

217
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,160
your

218
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,720
ip address what strings you were

219
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,240
searching for which of course google

220
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,919
also does

221
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,759
although google uses cookies and i think

222
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,000
this was it was done with ip addresses

223
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,800
now that is shortly before google

224
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,960
created 8.8 maybe they had it in them in

225
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,199
the works maybe this was their response

226
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,800
they're not talking around 2010

227
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
we got something called edns client

228
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,199
subnet and that's because if you

229
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,240
if everybody who is using your website

230
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,599
that is on a cdn like akamai for example

231
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,599
if they're all coming to you through

232
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,039
opendns

233
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,200
then there is no longer any correlation

234
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,360
between the dns query that you

235
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,519
use to learn the address of a web server

236
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,720
and the http or https

237
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,279
fetch that you then do subsequently and

238
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,959
it was that correlation that made the

239
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,959
cdn possible in other words that

240
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,680
they used your dns question to predict

241
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,640
your location

242
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,440
for a later https transaction that

243
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,720
stopped working

244
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,959
when people stopped using recursive name

245
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,640
servers on their lan

246
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,600
on their campus or on their isp so what

247
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,680
edns client subnet was designed to do is

248
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,640
bridge that gap

249
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,160
so that you would send your network

250
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,920
address to

251
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,399
the authority server from the recursive

252
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,000
server

253
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,640
to say by the way this is who's asking

254
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,399
this is the network where this question

255
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,480
came from please give me an answer that

256
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,839
is correct for that

257
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,120
that or optimal rather for for that end

258
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,959
network

259
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,560
that was the state of play when edward

260
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,480
snowden famously

261
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,120
uh flew to hong kong with a whole bunch

262
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,040
of government data

263
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,080
which about which much has been said and

264
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,839
written

265
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,760
so i'm not going to recount any of that

266
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
here but i will say that the very next

267
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,399
year

268
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,320
we got rfc 7258 talking about pervasive

269
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,360
monitoring

270
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,519
and how that it was a bad thing and the

271
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,720
iab

272
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,000
internet activities board then

273
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,240
recommended let's just not do that

274
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,320
anymore

275
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,600
so um

276
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,760
this is the new topology where instead

277
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,160
of just going to the internet and using

278
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,600
it you went through the internet to

279
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,120
reach your recursive

280
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,959
before going through your internet to

281
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,480
reach your cdn

282
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,440
and the recursive was now leaking your

283
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,480
information

284
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,560
across the internet to that cdn and

285
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,680
that's just

286
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,160
those were just business moves nobody

287
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,839
planned this this is just what we got

288
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,399
so because of all this pervasive

289
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,920
monitoring that was occurring because

290
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,079
these transactions are now going so

291
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,200
far from home before they get answered

292
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,399
the ietf created two standards first dns

293
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,920
over tls

294
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,519
and then dns over https

295
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,440
and to give you an idea of when this

296
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,880
happened there was a two year period

297
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,240
during which we had

298
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,399
dot just dns over tls before we got doh

299
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,680
and the problem with uh dot

300
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,959
from the ietf's point of view is that

301
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:09,600
while we

302
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,560
now had privacy and we had authenticity

303
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,000
we could be sure the transaction

304
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,360
was not being tinkered with it was still

305
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,760
possible for the isp or indeed anyone on

306
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,600
the path to block it

307
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,000
and being having the ability to block it

308
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,120
especially given

309
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,279
nation states the ability to block it

310
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,360
was considered unacceptable

311
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,839
so we got doh and this year we just got

312
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:32,399
rfc

313
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,680
8890 where the iab is doubling down on

314
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,279
all of this and saying the internet is

315
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,720
for end users

316
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,399
and everyone else needs to get out of

317
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,399
the way and let those end users do what

318
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,000
they do

319
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,839
sounds like a political statement to me

320
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,200
but nevertheless there's an rfc for it

321
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,160
so here's the new topology uh same thing

322
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,760
except we've added some stuff on the

323
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,680
right my team did so the

324
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,360
recursive server operator can now

325
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,200
monitor their traffic and even interfere

326
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,240
with it for

327
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,560
maybe ad blocking reasons or malware

328
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,079
blocking reasons

329
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,000
um and there's still a firewall that

330
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,839
prevents the

331
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,079
any of those stubs from sort of

332
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,160
bypassing that and going straight out to

333
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,680
the internet only the recursive is

334
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,440
allowed to speak dns

335
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,160
to the authority but now there's this

336
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,440
thing on the left which

337
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,079
is applications doing dns they're doing

338
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,519
it over doh

339
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,440
which is very difficult to firewall so

340
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,519
just bypasses all of that

341
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,600
so whatever monitoring you were doing

342
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,440
whatever filtering you were doing

343
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,440
is gone um so i want to say

344
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,399
this is not the end a lot of enterprises

345
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,279
run

346
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,200
a man-in-the-middle gateway for their

347
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,600
https traffic

348
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,240
they can't anymore they won't be able to

349
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,000
tls 1.3

350
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,839
with ech which used to be esni is now

351
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,079
ech

352
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,079
makes that impossible you just don't

353
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,440
have enough information

354
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,680
at the corporate gateway to know how to

355
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,079
intercept to be the man in the middle on

356
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,680
https so

357
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,600
if you're using a next-gen firewall or

358
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,279
if you're depending on one or you know

359
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,240
someone who is

360
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,920
you should let them know that the days

361
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,079
are numbered where that will work

362
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,399
and soon we're not going to see that

363
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,800
traffic

364
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,279
now i want to say that this is a

365
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,720
difference between the internet and the

366
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,360
web

367
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,720
on the internet it was a network of

368
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,320
networks and every network was

369
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,120
considered

370
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,320
i don't know autonomous um that's

371
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,600
just unacceptable in a web world and in

372
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,800
2000 lawrence lessig said uh

373
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,680
famously that code is law uh but this is

374
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,120
the information age

375
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,240
and um information superiority

376
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,519
kind of uh requires that you not let

377
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,639
other people

378
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,519
intercept or observe the information

379
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,480
that is necessary to your success

380
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,279
uh in 1990 an open system meant you

381
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,560
could change it

382
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,279
um today it just means you can fork it

383
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,440
see android for an example

384
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,639
um so again in the internet

385
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,959
all of these intermediaries have the

386
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,720
ability to move out of alignment

387
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,639
and say i'm not going to carry that

388
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,440
traffic whatever that might be it's some

389
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,440
maybe aup violation or something else

390
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,560
now let me just say if you like me

391
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,399
forget which way the direction of

392
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,920
entropy points

393
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,760
just remember that small human

394
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,839
children when they are first able to

395
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,680
walk will move

396
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,959
everything of like kind to be evenly uh

397
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,839
spaced throughout your house there will

398
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,199
be in other words junk

399
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,040
everywhere and there will be no pattern

400
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,680
to it that's high entropy

401
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,639
and what we're looking for if we're

402
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,240
trying to prevent

403
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,800
any of these intermediaries from seeing

404
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,279
or

405
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,480
modifying or blocking traffic is high

406
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,519
entropy

407
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,639
so an example of perfect entropy would

408
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,240
be compression

409
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,480
another would be encryption because the

410
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,760
output of either of those

411
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
processes will be something that is

412
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,160
completely unintelligible

413
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,800
has no pattern high infinite entropy or

414
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,040
at least perfect entropy

415
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,600
so that's what that looks like which is

416
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,880
that the user is now

417
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,920
connected to the service and the

418
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,880
the intermediaries cannot understand

419
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,839
what's going on

420
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,160
they can't then make policy decisions

421
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,240
about whether to carry it or not

422
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,440
it is uh it's a state of such high

423
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,240
entropy

424
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,160
that you don't know who they're talking

425
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,920
to what they're asking for or what

426
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,120
they're getting

427
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,000
and that might seem like a good thing if

428
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,800
you're

429
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,959
maybe a dissident living in a country

430
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,000
whose government

431
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,320
doesn't want you to use the internet but

432
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,480
uh it's not necessarily a good thing if

433
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:48,959
you're

434
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,360
i don't know on uh a cso trying to

435
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,240
secure a

436
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,519
corporate network so um everybody

437
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,680
looks the same on the wire everybody

438
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,360
looks like a nation-state

439
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,000
um and the protocols are evolving to

440
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,839
deal with nation-states who are doing

441
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,720
the things

442
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,320
that edward snowden pointed out they

443
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,079
were doing

444
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,079
so where are we

445
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,638
we've got

446
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,480
dot is available in most recursive

447
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,320
and authoritative servers but it's not

448
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,480
used very much some versions of android

449
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,199
use it

450
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,839
or can use it if you turn on dns privacy

451
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,320
but

452
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,079
um they're not that's not the default

453
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,880
um and the reason this is so hard is

454
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,680
because the

455
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,959
x509 certificate system doesn't make it

456
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:37,440
easy

457
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,079
to have an ip address as your common

458
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,199
name or your

459
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,199
server alt name it's in the spec but not

460
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,959
everybody implements it which means

461
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,880
you don't know as the client in this

462
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,800
case how to validate that the

463
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,560
certificate you're getting came from the

464
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,120
person you thought you were talking to

465
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,440
so the dot is having a rough start it's

466
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,759
two years older than doh

467
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,560
but it's uh it's harder to implement

468
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,400
harder to hold to deploy

469
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,039
and so what we have is doh coming later

470
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:07,439
and

471
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,520
uh kind of taking it but taking over

472
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,480
everything

473
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,039
firefox very controversial will turn on

474
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,240
doh

475
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,720
even if you haven't said that's okay

476
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,000
with you and they will select one

477
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,959
of their trusted recursive resolvers and

478
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,559
then after they've done that they'll ask

479
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:22,880
you

480
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,959
would you like to change back to the

481
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,679
less secure config

482
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,679
chrome on the other hand is willing to

483
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,679
use doh to whatever

484
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,840
recursive server your operating system

485
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,880
is using

486
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,039
if it works but they're not going to

487
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,880
select that server for you

488
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,240
they'll let you select a different

489
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,240
server than your os but

490
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,640
they don't automatically do it and the

491
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,000
other chromium forks i use

492
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,799
brave are probably going to wait and see

493
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,600
what the

494
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,240
apps doing dns working group of ietf

495
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,880
does

496
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,360
before they decide which way to jump

497
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,640
windows next year

498
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,120
shortly we'll start using doh but again

499
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,400
only if the server

500
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,160
you're using supports it ios

501
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,200
and mac os will use

502
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,120
doh if you make a system-wide config or

503
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,679
if the app decides that it wants to

504
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,520
opt-in to that behavior

505
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,360
so any app on ios or mac os

506
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,160
is capable of bypassing the the

507
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,720
recursive server that's been assigned

508
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,000
now the mdm system can

509
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,080
usually control the browser or the

510
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,360
operating system

511
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,400
and say yeah the the local network admin

512
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,640
who you know has my keys does not want

513
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,919
that to happen

514
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,240
and uh you know who knows maybe that

515
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,440
will be effective but

516
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,320
i think not and there's a reason for

517
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,919
that

518
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,679
and that is there are a lot of end users

519
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,600
that are very happy with this they think

520
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,799
that

521
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,880
having their transactions not be

522
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,840
monitored or

523
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,280
interfered with by their network

524
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,880
operator is a good thing

525
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,320
it's only really if you're a network

526
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,200
operator for example family filtering or

527
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,520
a cso with corporate filtering or maybe

528
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,039
some

529
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,400
mandated oversight that they do

530
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,080
those people are unhappy for the same

531
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,240
reason which is the doh is a good

532
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,280
anti-censorship system and

533
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,679
i want to note google was sued by

534
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,640
comcast

535
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,160
over doh and in that lawsuit it was

536
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,840
alleged that both companies are in the

537
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,320
advertising business and google is using

538
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,919
their doh advantage

539
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,400
to disintermediate comcast not sure

540
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,160
everybody knew that comcast was in the

541
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,400
advertising business but they said so

542
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,720
in a lawsuit which means that the

543
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,400
pervasive monitoring we're talking about

544
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
really has been happening

545
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,880
um russia has already said they're not

546
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,640
going to be allowing any of this new

547
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,080
stuff

548
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,520
now they said esni they mean ech but

549
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,799
there are a lot of countries that are

550
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,720
going to take this view so a lot of

551
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,400
stuff is about to break

552
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,240
because various people are going to play

553
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,200
chicken with other people's traffic

554
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,280
um i noticed a day or so ago that

555
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,120
as a big sur mac os no longer

556
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,360
lets little snatch or any other firewall

557
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,240
you have see

558
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,720
all of the traffic so facetime for

559
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,039
example bypasses your own firewall

560
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,200
i guess apple does not trust their own

561
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,440
users to see what apple's applications

562
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,720
are doing

563
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,240
that seems like the opposite of the

564
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,840
message in the 1984

565
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,760
super bowl commercial but it is

566
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,440
absolutely in keeping with what we're

567
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,720
seeing here

568
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,679
and http itself is going to move to a

569
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,200
very similar

570
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,159
perfect entropy model using something

571
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,120
called quick

572
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,039
which has no connect system call

573
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,400
required you can just

574
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,039
if you have a udp socket you can speak

575
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:43,840
which means

576
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,480
antivirus ad blockers and content

577
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
filters won't know when a new

578
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,960
transaction is beginning or to whom and

579
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,720
so all of that will have to move into

580
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,159
the browser

581
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,520
which i guess is good if you make

582
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,600
browsers so here's what you can do

583
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,520
right i've told you most of this before

584
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,280
but now i'm telling you what you can do

585
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,760
about it

586
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,520
and one thing you probably are not going

587
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,799
to win at is

588
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,200
demand making an explicit proxy and then

589
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,039
making everybody use it

590
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,799
i might be able to achieve that in my

591
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,559
company but i probably cannot achieve

592
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,240
that with all the iot

593
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,600
gizmos in my house so i'm going to have

594
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,559
to do something

595
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,200
and one thing you can do is look at

596
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,559
mozilla's

597
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,280
trusted recursive resolver rules again

598
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,000
i'm not a fan

599
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,320
of mozilla's policies in this area but

600
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,520
they are

601
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,919
setting a certain standard of limiting

602
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,600
the data how data is used

603
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,919
by a recursive server so maybe

604
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,400
protecting that pii i told you about

605
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,240
transparency as far as what they are

606
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,520
doing with the data

607
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,280
and not doing any filtering unless

608
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,799
required by law

609
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,200
okay so again i'm not in love with

610
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,960
mozilla's actions here but

611
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,080
they have set this standard and comcast

612
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,960
as an example is someone who has adopted

613
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,360
that

614
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,440
they've created a trusted recursive

615
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,919
resolver capable system it does

616
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,000
and does not do all of the things that

617
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,440
mozilla demands

618
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,360
and they have asked to be listed as a

619
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,039
trr for mozilla

620
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,000
firefox users but that's a secondary

621
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,039
concern

622
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,760
uh the the more important point is that

623
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,960
they can now claim

624
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,120
validly so with auditors and

625
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,880
transparency and so forth

626
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,679
that they are a safe place to send your

627
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,640
dns

628
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,400
they have exited this part of the

629
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,640
advertising business they're promising

630
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,559
not to do the thing that they were

631
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,679
accusing google

632
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,320
in that lawsuit of doing you can do that

633
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:36,880
too

634
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,360
you can run one of these servers and run

635
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,000
it according

636
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,640
to mozilla's rules and then you can turn

637
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,960
on doh so that you can legitimately

638
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,360
claim

639
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,520
to your users your customers your

640
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,720
employees

641
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,360
that you're not doing bad things with

642
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,520
their dns traffic that you are a trusted

643
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,840
recursive resolver

644
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,360
you're going to have to do that if you

645
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,039
don't do that people are i mean people

646
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,120
will bypass you anyway

647
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,280
but if you give them this excuse then

648
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,280
more people will bypass you

649
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,320
and it's actually good to keep local dns

650
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,559
local you don't want to go across the

651
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,240
the whole internet to reach a recursive

652
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,880
service

653
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,240
you don't want to put it in the hands of

654
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,520
somebody who might be under a different

655
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,320
legal regime

656
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,600
and so on so you really in order to

657
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,280
avoid confrontation

658
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,120
you have to go do this you have to

659
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,880
deploy it yourself

660
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,640
make sure everybody knows you've done it

661
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,840
okay so um

662
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,640
this is the information age so it's not

663
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,000
land it's not sea it's

664
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,360
not air it's not space it's information

665
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,600
and whoever has information superiority

666
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,279
gets to control their own business

667
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:43,919
conditions

668
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,559
and everybody else's and the way this

669
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,000
works is very simple you

670
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,200
surveil you predict and you control

671
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,919
and you keep doing that and you you do

672
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,039
that

673
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,760
with everything and so it's the

674
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,159
surveillance capitalism model because

675
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,799
it gives you power in the information

676
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,880
age to do so

677
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,200
so whatever the internet protocols do

678
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,120
and whatever the configuration defaults

679
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,720
are now controls everybody's destiny

680
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,279
and you know yes we regularly see people

681
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,279
leaving the surveillance capitalism

682
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,640
world and saying

683
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,960
i hate the world i have helped create i

684
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,640
didn't realize it was going to be this

685
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,440
ugly

686
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,279
i didn't realize that i was helping

687
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,240
bring george orwell's nightmares to life

688
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,679
yeah but they do that after they've

689
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,000
spent 10 to 20 years

690
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,919
helping do stuff so the regrets you're

691
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,039
having later

692
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,480
don't actually have much impact

693
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,159
now if you don't like what i'm talking

694
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,919
about if you don't want to go do this

695
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,840
you have to i'm sorry but if you don't

696
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,679
want it to keep getting

697
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,919
more like this go join the

698
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,799
apps2 indians working group go join the

699
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,400
encrypted dns

700
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,520
initiative go get involved go

701
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,320
let your voice be heard i am one of the

702
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,559
few from the security industry

703
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,960
who is also interested in dns and

704
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,720
therefore shows up there

705
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,120
so mostly we've got dns people deciding

706
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,640
how dns ought to work

707
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,120
in a way that has profound implications

708
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
on network security

709
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,880
that they either don't know about or

710
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,120
don't care about they keep telling me my

711
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,919
firewalls are 1990s technology

712
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,720
i should secure my endpoints yeah let me

713
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,000
show you my endpoint

714
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,880
anyway that's my story i'm sticking to

715
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,360
it

716
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,799
we have a few minutes for questions

717
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,919
thanks paul we'll give folks a moment

718
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,520
here there are no questions

719
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,840
open in the queue

720
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,320
you see that there paul uh

721
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,559
there's chat i see i gotta click on

722
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,679
something

723
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,760
so i can just read for you if you want

724
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,120
oh i got it right here got it

725
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,360
practical recommendation which dns

726
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,320
provider for

727
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,840
home user um well let me

728
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,880
suggest that you should probably buy a

729
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,640
raspberry pi there are a lot of them

730
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,159
they're cheap

731
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,159
you could go even smaller you could you

732
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,240
know there are cheaper ones but

733
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,840
you should probably just install linux

734
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,760
and turn on whatever recursive server

735
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,559
came with it

736
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,640
and use that one that's the best one you

737
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,600
will ever find

738
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,120
because it keeps your data local you

739
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,799
don't have foreign dependencies you

740
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,919
don't have

741
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,679
distant dependencies you don't have

742
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,200
risks you don't have to do much of

743
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,400
anything

744
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,080
but if you can't do that if you for

745
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,760
whatever if you're trying to set this up

746
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,960
for your parents and you don't want to

747
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,320
be assisted men for

748
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,559
for them for life then really any of the

749
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,320
so-called public dns servers

750
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
that have four numbers separated by

751
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,440
three dots

752
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,600
are likely to be trustworthy

753
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,919
if you're a comcast user just let use

754
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:56,720
the isp

755
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,840
because comcast has has come into

756
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,480
conformity with with these rules

757
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,039
it's worth if you're in europe then your

758
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,200
isp is worried about gdpr

759
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,440
and they're worried about pii so they

760
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,039
are also conforming to

761
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,600
the same rules so it's really only if

762
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,840
you're outside of civilization

763
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,799
where uh we where dogs eat dogs that you

764
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,399
need to worry about what the

765
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,440
isp might do with your internet traffic

766
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,760
so you're perfectly safe in canada

767
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,360
believe it or not you're perfectly safe

768
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,039
in china because they're

769
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,120
they care very much about who gets to

770
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,720
see what people are doing

771
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,360
um so check out what's already happening

772
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,640
it may be fine

773
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,840
otherwise you know i've i know people at

774
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,679
cloudflare i know people at google i

775
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,480
know people at

776
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,679
quad 9 and they're all they're all

777
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,200
doing the right thing they're doing what

778
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,960
they say they're doing so if you

779
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,279
just can't use your isp and you can't

780
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,399
run your own

781
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,480
and you have to adopt this modern way of

782
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,080
doing things then

783
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,840
they're all pretty much okay uh pie hole

784
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,960
good suggestion

785
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,200
uh the the pie hole people done a good

786
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,760
job of packaging a recursive server in

787
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,279
tiny hardware um

788
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,399
and if you're worried about educational

789
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,039
establishments who can't control their

790
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,399
endpoints anymore because

791
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,039
rpg no longer works because the server

792
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,480
is being bypassed

793
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,399
you may have to become confrontational

794
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,159
there may not be a cooperative way to

795
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,760
solve that problem

796
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,320
so you may have to start learning where

797
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,080
the recursive name servers of the world

798
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,799
are

799
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,159
and blocking all https traffic to those

800
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,960
ip addresses

801
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,840
i don't like that world but i don't know

802
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,679
what i can do i can't offer you a better

803
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,039
better answer really the canary domain

804
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:47,760
approach

805
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,240
where you can make a query where the app

806
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,799
will make a query locally to see if

807
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,600
the local recursive server doesn't

808
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,279
really want you to bypass it

809
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,799
you know that'll work if everybody

810
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,799
cooperates but if

811
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,640
you have a malicious actor inside your

812
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,840
network they're probably not going to

813
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,120
make that query and they're not going to

814
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,799
care what your policy is

815
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,799
so that is fig leaf

816
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,480
doq dns over uh quick that's certainly

817
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,360
coming

818
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,799
but um it isn't here yet and

819
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,720
it'll probably be a little better just

820
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,640
because you won't have all that tcp

821
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,520
state you'll have a

822
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,559
fair amount of tls state and http 3

823
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,919
state or rather

824
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,039
quick state but it will at least

825
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,720
lack some of the headline blocking

826
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,039
problems that http

827
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,080
has recent cash poisoning studies

828
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,360
um yes i think um this

829
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,039
recent thing where all of a sudden the

830
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,760
kaminsky attack is back on the table

831
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,679
it's a big deal uh if you haven't heard

832
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,279
about it

833
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,039
contact me by email i'll send you some

834
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,960
urls

835
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,520
and it is likely to cause another surge

836
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,440
of dns sect deployment because that's

837
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,640
the real fix for any of this

838
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,360
and it will likely be the excuse that a

839
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,120
lot of

840
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,520
people who sort of want to be your dns

841
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,320
server will use to try to

842
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,159
twist your arm a little bit and get you

843
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,480
to send your dns traffic to them

844
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,000
be careful that you understand what

845
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,679
their motives are for that

846
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,840
and what the side effects might be

847
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,679
