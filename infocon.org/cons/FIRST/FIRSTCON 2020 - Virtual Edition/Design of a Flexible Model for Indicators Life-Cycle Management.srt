00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,920
hello everyone and welcome to this

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,000
presentation about indicator lifecycle

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,720
management

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,879
methodology and practical usage with

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,120
myth

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,679
so today we are going to discuss how

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,040
trust data quality

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,200
and freshness can be used to prioritize

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,880
iocs

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,359
also methodology with models to score

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,560
iocs

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,000
and implementation in fact of indicator

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,439
lifecycle management in misp

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,880
so now we are quickly going to see why

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,599
and how

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,719
you should expiry iocs

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,960
so you probably all know that sharing

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,640
information about threats is

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,040
crucial especially in the cyber security

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,879
sector

21
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,960
something that we noticed is that

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,160
organizations

23
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,920
are sharing more and more fortunately

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,559
if you look at the graph that is below

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,559
it shows the cumulative contribution

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,760
by unique organization where the

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,800
information they share

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,920
was meant to be propagated so these

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,199
numbers are coming from

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,040
one of our instance for the private

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,560
sector

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,200
you could have other scenario happening

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,960
depending on your community but

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,000
we noticed that we have this on our

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,360
instance so you can see

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,759
your over here organizations are sharing

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,799
more and more and

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,560
more and more organizations are sharing

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,560
so one of the one of the biggest problem

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,360
that you have

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,119
when you are in an environment where

42
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,640
everyone is sharing

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,640
is that you have to to deal with data

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
created by multiple parties

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,880
so you have issues with trust because

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,720
sometimes you don't know

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,360
who shared and who created the data also

48
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,040
data quality not everyone

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,119
produce the same quality of data and the

50
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,720
road events issue by relevance it

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,240
depends

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,320
what what are you supposed to do with

53
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,399
the data do you want only actionable

54
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,640
data or do you want

55
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,680
to do some research over it so it's kind

56
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,040
of linked to the use case

57
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,680
and interest and these two can be

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,479
conflicting

59
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,880
so as i said if you want to do

60
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,000
operational security

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
you just want ioc to be blocked you

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,160
don't have the same use case as someone

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,720
that

64
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,640
wants to do attribution and a research

65
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,520
about specific threats

66
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,800
so one way to kind of tackle this issue

67
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
is to use what we call taxonomies

68
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,360
and we are going to see that in more

69
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,120
depth in a few slides

70
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,319
but it's basically just label

71
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,480
that you can attach to data and it can

72
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,280
describe what you want to do with them

73
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,560
and how to do it

74
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,560
so the second problem is that these iocs

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,160
can be shared in large

76
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,200
quantities and due to that we only have

77
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,760
partial information about the freshness

78
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,440
and partial information about the

79
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,480
validity of this data

80
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,200
and to tackle this issue we use

81
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,400
something that we call

82
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,000
sightings in misp and also we are going

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,800
to see

84
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,400
how and and how it is used

85
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,200
uh in in the platform but the main idea

86
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,519
of

87
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,280
this presentation about the decline

88
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,879
model that we are going to present

89
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,080
is that it combines both

90
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,239
these taxonomies and the sighting to

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,959
to provide indicator lifecycle

92
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,519
management

93
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,440
so let's take a deep dive into sighting

94
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,560
so what is it

95
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
so sightings add a temporal context to

96
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,000
indicators

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,319
so it can be used to represent detection

98
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,080
or activity of a specific

99
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,400
ioc so for example if you have an ip

100
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,840
address

101
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,159
and you notice that it has some activity

102
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,799
or your sim detect that it was

103
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,319
try to be accessed you can represent

104
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,120
this

105
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,920
by adding a sighting to this ip address

106
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,200
and so in the end it gives us

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,360
credibility and visibility to the

108
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,640
indicator so

109
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,519
if it is used or not or if it has been

110
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,840
detected or not

111
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,760
one cool use case of this is that you

112
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,920
can create a continuous feedback loop

113
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,439
between your trade information sharing

114
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,400
platform

115
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,080
and your insurance detection software

116
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,199
where you will the intelligent detection

117
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,519
will take its inputs its data into it

118
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,959
from the training

119
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,320
trade information sharing and and then

120
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,360
report back detections back to

121
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,199
the in that case to to to miss

122
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,840
and so with that you can prioritize

123
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,240
active ioses and decays old ones that

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,960
are not used

125
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,840
so now back to the taxonomies so

126
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,320
taxonomies are set our set of common

127
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,360
libraries to express

128
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,919
the same vocabularies and it's a simple

129
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,080
way to attach classification to data

130
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,120
so here a few examples of

131
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,199
such taxonomies so admirality skills

132
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,720
economic impact

133
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,880
estimative language tlp that you

134
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,039
probably know

135
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,759
something that is important in that

136
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,479
context

137
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,600
is that the classification must be used

138
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,320
globally

139
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,759
and to be efficient so

140
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,320
nearly everyone or the best would be

141
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,120
that everyone

142
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,039
use the same taxonomies to describe the

143
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,520
same thing otherwise if everyone just

144
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,160
use different taxonomy or different tags

145
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,680
you can't do anything with it because

146
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,360
you may not understand what the other

147
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,479
parties are sharing

148
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,680
so this is an example of the admiralty

149
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,080
skill taxonomy

150
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,720
you can see that we have multiple tags

151
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,400
so you can

152
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,880
give information about information

153
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,840
credibility

154
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,680
you can give information about source

155
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,639
reliability

156
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,840
this is just an example and we'll see

157
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,560
how

158
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,960
we can leverage these taxonomies to to

159
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,120
well ranked and score attributes and

160
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,680
iocs

161
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,120
so you've probably noticed that some

162
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,080
taxonomies

163
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,240
and in particular the admiralty scale

164
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,840
have a numerical value attached to the

165
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,360
tax

166
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,720
and this allows us to use

167
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,960
this concept in mathematical expression

168
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,440
so if you look at the admiralty scale

169
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,440
taxonomy we have defined these mappings

170
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,680
so for example usually reliable

171
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,960
has a numerical value of 75

172
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,319
unreliable have a vehicle value of zero

173
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,600
same for the credibility

174
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,240
uh so if it's probably true possibly

175
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,800
true

176
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,319
and so on we have at we have maps this

177
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,360
concept to numerical value and with that

178
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,240
we can use these tags and tax numbers

179
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,440
in mathematical expression

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,199
something that can be debited is

181
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,520
how the mapping is done so for example

182
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,160
for the reliability

183
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,880
we've mapped deliberately deceptive to

184
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,759
zero

185
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,280
and reliability cannot be judged to 50.

186
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,639
so this is something that you can debate

187
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,479
and that you may not agree with the

188
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,600
mapping with it

189
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,960
[Music]

190
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,199
but in the end everyone should be able

191
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,080
to override

192
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,479
this value so in the misp implementation

193
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,160
you have the possibility to set your own

194
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,000
value if you do not agree with the

195
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,160
default one

196
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,240
so this is a very high level formula on

197
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,919
our solution on how to decay

198
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,520
and score iocs

199
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,240
so to score iocs or we take two

200
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,000
components into account

201
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,440
the first one is the base core

202
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,720
which is the initial score of the ioc

203
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
only considering the context

204
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,199
of this ioc so for example the type is

205
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,599
it an ip address is it a file

206
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,520
uh is it a hash and so on but also

207
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,080
all the tags and taxonomies attached to

208
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,919
this ioc

209
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,120
and the second component is the decay

210
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,800
which is basically a function composed

211
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,120
of a lifetime and a decay speed

212
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,639
and this function just decreases

213
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,840
the the base score over time so reduces

214
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,080
its value and so

215
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,240
with that we can score iocs

216
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,559
so this is how it looks graphically so

217
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,519
on the y-axis you have the score of an

218
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,240
ioc and the x-axis you have the time

219
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,958
and so the the curve shows the score

220
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,880
over time

221
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,959
so at the beginning you can see that so

222
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,480
when the time is

223
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,920
uh let's say at zero the score is equal

224
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,120
to the base score

225
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,560
and then over time this this score will

226
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:56,880
be

227
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,040
decreased depending on how the decay

228
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:08,480
express this this decay speed

229
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,399
so let's see how it is implemented in

230
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,839
misp uh it

231
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,959
can be this uh

232
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,360
this model can be implemented in every

233
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,959
software but as miss

234
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,000
already contained

235
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,920
full-blown implementation of it it's

236
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,120
much easier

237
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,800
and visually pleasant to use it

238
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,160
so if you're familiar with misp

239
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
you may recognize this interface but for

240
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,519
those who are not familiar

241
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,880
it just shows a table here composed of

242
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,080
iocs

243
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,480
and on the top right you have a score

244
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,560
column

245
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,839
that gives the score of all of these

246
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,880
iocs

247
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,240
based on the different model applied so

248
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,160
for the first row for example for the ip

249
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,720
address 5.5.5.5

250
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,600
you have two models the first model is

251
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,920
nids simple decaying model

252
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,279
which gave a value of 65 and the second

253
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,399
model is model

254
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,560
called model 5 and gave value close to

255
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,000
80. so by

256
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
looking at this you can see that this ip

257
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,079
address has not been decayed at the time

258
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:18,399
this

259
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,279
this screenshot was taken but if you

260
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,880
look at the last

261
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,120
row with the ip address 6.6.6.6

262
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,640
you have again these two models but

263
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,000
the score is too low and so it is

264
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,320
marked as decay indicated by the

265
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,560
red highlight of the of the score

266
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,880
so it does not really make sense to only

267
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,440
have

268
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,800
this car and decay exposed to a web

269
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,680
interface

270
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,399
it's much more convenient and usable to

271
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,959
have it exposed in the api too

272
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,079
so again if you're familiar with the

273
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,560
mis api you will directly notice what's

274
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
new but for twos who are not familiar

275
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
when you are searching for data

276
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,160
uh it will be returned so the the

277
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,120
particular

278
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,240
ioc in that case is an ip source of the

279
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,600
value 8.8.8.8 and if you request

280
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,399
the decay information you will get back

281
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,720
a new key called tk score and it will

282
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,279
contain

283
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,360
this the dynamically computed score of

284
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,600
this attribute at the current time

285
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,640
and it will give you a flag meaning if

286
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,600
this ioc should be marked as decayed or

287
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:37,920
not

288
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,680
depending on the model used and in that

289
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
case it was the model an idea simple

290
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,399
licking model

291
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,720
so when the implicit implementation in

292
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,240
miss was done

293
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
it had this objective and i think

294
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,920
everyone that would like to implement

295
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,480
this in the system should uh

296
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,680
stick to to this point so to provide

297
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
automatic scoring based on default value

298
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,480
because

299
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,800
you for user it may be a bit complicated

300
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,040
to understand how the models work

301
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,839
and so on so it should provide automatic

302
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,079
scoring

303
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,120
by default also on the fly computation

304
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,600
so

305
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,800
do not store the the data well the score

306
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,120
in a database because this curve

307
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,680
vary over time and it should not touch

308
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,320
the data

309
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,760
either so the only way to do it properly

310
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,600
and cleanly is to provide an overlay

311
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
without touching the data

312
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,160
and this overlay would contain the score

313
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,760
of the ioc

314
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,040
computed at the time of the request

315
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,680
also it should provide but that's also

316
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,320
optional

317
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,720
a user-friendly ui to set uh different

318
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,480
model configurations so for example to

319
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,279
set

320
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,920
uh the lifetime or the decay speed of

321
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,519
the different model it should be

322
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,639
rather user-friendly to do it

323
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,480
also provides simulation tools on the

324
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,760
live data so that

325
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,240
users that are creating their own models

326
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,680
can experience it

327
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,320
and view its effect on live data

328
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,160
this this point is probably the most

329
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,079
important is interaction through the api

330
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:08,880
because

331
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,440
uh having such tool in a web interface

332
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,200
is nice but it's not really useful if

333
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,600
you don't

334
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,399
expose it in the api and last but not

335
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:16,720
least

336
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,079
the opportunity for user to create their

337
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,440
own formula or

338
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,600
algorithm because everyone do not

339
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
always agree with what you are

340
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,760
expressing and how you want to compute

341
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,720
stuff so if you

342
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,360
can provide them a way to describe how

343
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:33,839
the

344
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,040
formula or what algorithm to use it's

345
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,680
always better

346
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,760
so in misp we called model

347
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,320
and well there are basically

348
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,519
instantiation

349
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,839
of a formula with configurable

350
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,600
parameters so we've talked a bit about

351
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,440
it so you have the lifetime

352
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,240
which consists in how long an ioc should

353
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,839
be kept in the system

354
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,800
you have also the decay rate so how fast

355
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,680
an ifc

356
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,720
should lose its score over time an

357
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,000
optional threshold

358
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,839
allowing you to discard an ioc

359
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,040
sooner than when the score reaches zero

360
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,880
and a default base score if you don't

361
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,959
have any taxonomies or tags

362
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,240
attached to an ioc you want to provide a

363
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,120
full back value

364
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
and then you also have mapping

365
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
parameters so how the base core should

366
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,839
be computed

367
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,399
so which taxonomy should

368
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,560
get priority when you are computing the

369
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,040
base car

370
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,880
also a way to map

371
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,240
the type of the ioc with the model so

372
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,920
this is actually extremely important

373
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,560
because an ip address

374
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,040
should be decayed most probably faster

375
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,720
than the file hash because an ip address

376
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,880
can change over time while the file has

377
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,240
well it will not change so if you have a

378
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,560
hash of a malware it will probably stay

379
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,800
the same for a very long period of time

380
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,480
so that's why models should behave

381
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,160
differently depending on the type of the

382
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,360
ioc you are considering

383
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,279
and the last one is the formula or

384
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,120
algorithm used by the different model

385
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,800
so this is what you have in the

386
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,560
interface in miss for

387
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,440
all the models so you can load multiple

388
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,480
model at once

389
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,360
and depending on your configuration you

390
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,920
can

391
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,279
ask an ioc to to have hits

392
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,199
its score computed against one model

393
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,959
or multiple model at the same time

394
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,480
so this is the user-friendly

395
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,920
configuration interface

396
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,800
to design your own model and to perform

397
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,759
mapping

398
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,199
so we can see that we have

399
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,199
the possibility to set the different

400
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,440
parameters like the lifetime

401
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,480
the decay speed and the threshold

402
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,410
and you have this nice graph showing you

403
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,839
[Music]

404
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,120
the the result of these parameters so

405
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,240
if you were to touch the lifetime for

406
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,120
example

407
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,519
the number of days here would increase

408
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,440
same if you touch the decay speed you

409
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,360
may have

410
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,519
a steeper curve on it

411
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,440
same for the threshold and on the left

412
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,440
you have a table showing the mapping

413
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,880
on which of which attribute type should

414
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,880
be considered and applied to this model

415
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,680
so this is the base core uh

416
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,440
configuration tool

417
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,320
so to go quickly over it uh to compute a

418
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,759
base score

419
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,800
you may want to to wait and well to

420
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,639
apply weight on the different tax

421
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,000
enemies if they are applied

422
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,680
to one one ioc so

423
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,759
for example you may want to prioritize

424
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,120
let's say confidence or likelihood

425
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,040
probability

426
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,359
on an ioc and also

427
00:17:09,368 --> 00:17:12,488
[Music]

428
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,119
cut so this is the

429
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,959
the base core uh configuration tools

430
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,240
it allows you to map the different rate

431
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,959
on the taxonomies that you want to be

432
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,319
taken into account when you are

433
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,559
computing the initial base score

434
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,280
of the ioc so the idea is just

435
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,320
to allow you to really

436
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,160
specify what taxonomies have precedence

437
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,280
over

438
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,320
another so for example in that case you

439
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
have the priority level tax number which

440
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,120
should

441
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,480
take close to 50 percent of

442
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,960
the the base call computation and the

443
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,840
other two

444
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,840
uh should well share what's remaining

445
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,720
so now the simulation tool uh

446
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,600
well it's it provides an interface to

447
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,799
show the decay

448
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,480
of different models on an ioc

449
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,600
on ioc's store in your system so this is

450
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,360
a nice example

451
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,000
where you can see that when the ioc was

452
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,200
created it had

453
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,440
a base score of 80 and then it loses

454
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,320
this value over time

455
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,080
and in august it received the new

456
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,799
sightings resetting the base car

457
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,799
and so on and so forth and now the

458
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,400
current state when distribution was

459
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
taken

460
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,240
the the ioc had a value of

461
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,240
54 making it not decayed

462
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,880
as you can see

463
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,679
so fortunes windows mips this is how you

464
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,640
configure

465
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,880
and how you ask dk model to be applied

466
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,840
on your data so you just pass include dk

467
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,960
score to one

468
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,080
to ask the system to include the dq

469
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,360
information

470
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,559
we can also pass exclude gk flag meaning

471
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,000
that if this flag is set

472
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,960
it will filter out all attributes and

473
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,400
all iocs

474
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,679
that that have been marked as decay by

475
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,000
the

476
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,880
different models and you can also

477
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,400
provide

478
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,039
what what model should be applied to to

479
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:31,440
your

480
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,960
search and also you can change the model

481
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,840
configuration on the fly if you wish but

482
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,639
it's totally optional

483
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,760
so this one is a bit

484
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,600
of gadget but the idea is to let users

485
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,799
create their own formula and our

486
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,840
own algorithm to to the system so if

487
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,880
they want to add

488
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,039
like query against a reputation service

489
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,640
to alter the base car

490
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,400
or if they want to add

491
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,960
like a different formula to compute the

492
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,919
actual score

493
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,039
you can do it uh uh in

494
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,480
in this kind of file this is just a

495
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,120
template but it really shows you how

496
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,400
easy it is to create

497
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,000
a new dq algorithm so you just have to

498
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,919
implement two functions the compute base

499
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:22,640
score

500
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,559
which received the model the attribute

501
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,080
the base score and the elapsed time

502
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,559
since

503
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,919
the last sighting and this algorithm

504
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,320
should return a miracle score

505
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,159
and the second function to implement is

506
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,240
the isdk that should written just a

507
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,400
boolean

508
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,159
representing if the ioc should be

509
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,080
expired or not

510
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,120
and that's basically it so for anyone

511
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,840
having a bit of php background

512
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,080
it's fairly easy to to do it you could

513
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,960
even do

514
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,960
the whole algorithm in python and then

515
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,120
call it from the php file

516
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,918
that works too

517
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,039
so to conclude information uh

518
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,600
may share may transit through a couple

519
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,440
of connected instances

520
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,679
uh and this raised issue about trust and

521
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,880
validity

522
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,120
where it plays a big role in how data

523
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,400
should be used

524
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,280
in your in your platform a methodology

525
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,240
to score iocs was presented

526
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,559
as well as its implementation in the

527
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,918
miss open source software

528
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,600
so we presented one strategy with

529
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,080
with base score and sighting resetting

530
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,240
the score to the base score

531
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,320
but these are also other strategies that

532
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,400
are currently under review

533
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,200
so the improved support of sightings and

534
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,720
so in miss you have the positive

535
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,400
sightings and the false positive

536
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,919
sightings

537
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,760
somehow false positive sightings should

538
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,520
be taken into account then reduce the

539
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,919
scope this is not the case right now but

540
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,799
it would be nice to have it another

541
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,159
strategy

542
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,760
or algorithm would be to

543
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,799
prioritize citing surges instead of a

544
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,400
sporadic one

545
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,280
so the idea is to instead of resetting

546
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,799
the score to the base core

547
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,960
when you receive a sighting the score

548
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,840
should be increased additively based on

549
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,080
the number of sightings you receive in

550
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,880
the

551
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,880
current in the time span

552
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,400
also include correlation

553
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,760
between iocs in the scoring so just to

554
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,679
take into account the correlation

555
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,760
and give a higher score for high

556
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,720
correlating iocs for example

557
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,320
and the last one which is also

558
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,760
interesting is

559
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,880
more mean less saying that

560
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,240
if an ioc has way too much sightings

561
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,120
it's probably a false positive and it

562
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,760
should be

563
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:54,159
marked as decay so these are just ids

564
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,360
would be nice to have uh in bisp

565
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,120
so that the model the different model

566
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,400
could support this

567
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,919
if you have any other ideas please feel

568
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,919
free to get in touch with us

569
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,520
this is a fairly new project so

570
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,200
we're really happy to get feedback about

571
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,640
it

572
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,960
so i hope you liked it the presentation

573
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,679
and

574
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:17,679
thanks
