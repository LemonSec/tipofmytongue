the session you are listening to is

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,760
product security education and

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,800
prevention through

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,840
root cause analysis and secure software

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,440
development life cycle

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,160
um just one item before we get started

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,120
we ask you

um questions will be queued in the order

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
received and we will address them as

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,280
either we go as we go along or at the

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,640
end of the session

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,320
and with that i'd like to go ahead and

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,640
get started um so today

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,520
we have two speakers from sap's product

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,880
security response team

38
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,200
i'm stuart short based in germany and

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,799
shipra agrawal

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,159
based in india so stuart and shepard

41
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:30,960
they both have

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,119
a vast experience in vulnerability

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,159
handlings

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,200
um and i think

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,640
without further ado i should hand it

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,400
over to our speakers so over to you

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,720
stewart and cheaper

48
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,840
hi my name is stuart

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,000
short and welcome to our presentation

50

i've been working for sap for

51
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,840
over 14 years now mainly in software

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,799
security

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,560
i worked in the cloud area research

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,320
department and piecert

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,119
based in waldorf germany and i'm joined

56

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,840
from product security incident response

62
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,319
team

63
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,800
and i am also with sap and with software

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,640
security for more than 13 years

65
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,440
now and some of the key roles that i

66
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,080
have

67
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,400
done in the past few years is managing

68
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,599
the

69
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,640
monthly security patch days for sap

70
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,239
couple of pack bounty programs

71
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,040
and i have been also working with stuart

72
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,120
lately on the root cause analysis

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,120
implementation and execution in the last

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,560
couple of years

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
and yeah with that uh thank you very

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
much for taking your time

77
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,800
and joining us for this session today we

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,319
are really excited to share our

79
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,480
learnings and experiences

80
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,400
while implementing root cause analysis

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
at sap

82
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,890
yeah so let's get started um

83
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,080
[Music]

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,000
this is how we are planning to go about

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,360
this session today

86
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,680
uh we would like to first you know

87
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,720
introduce

88
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,360
you to the root cause analysis concept

89
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,599
as such what do we mean by it

90
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,000
and then we will see how it makes sense

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,879
to incorporate

92
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,519
it in secure software development life

93
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,400
cycle

94
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,560
and how we have gone about implementing

95
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,879
and formalizing it at sap

96
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,080
and then we will walk you through the

97
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
step-by-step methodology that we have

98
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,959
been following when we do a rca for a

99
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,720
vulnerability

100
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,760
and we would also you know like to talk

101
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,440
a lot about our experiences and

102
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,720
learnings uh

103
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,799
in the past few years while doing this

104
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,879
exercise and

105
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,760
with that we would also you know like to

106
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,840
show you some key benefits that we have

107
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,720
seen

108
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,959
uh in the past years and that we are

109
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,120
expecting to see going forward of

110
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,959
while doing rca and with that we hope to

111
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:53,920
give you a lot of

112
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,400
insights into how you can go back and

113
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,840
implement a successful rca for your

114
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,560
organization

115
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,599
and yeah so

116
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,959
i would like to start with this famous

117
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:07,760
quote

118
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,840
which is very much applicable uh for us

119
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,599
in our day-to-day lives

120
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,760
which says when you make a mistake there

121
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,280
are only three things that you should

122
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,040
ever do about it

123
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,759
admit it learn from it and don't repeat

124
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,199
it

125
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,840
this is actually the you know exact

126
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,520
foundation of root cause analysis

127
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,800
concept

128
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,199
because it talks about learning from our

129
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,280
past mistakes and working on it so that

130
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,199
we don't repeat them and don't encounter

131
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,400
the same problems in future

132
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,199
so that being said uh let's look at it a

133
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,080
little bit

134
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,280
more in detail so i want each one of you

135
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,560
to think about the last

136
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,440
major problem you had at work did you

137
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
take the time to find out the uh you

138
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,000
know

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,639
actual underlying cause or did you dealt

140
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,680
with the

141
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,320
symptoms yeah did you implement a quick

142
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,639
fix that only dealt with symptoms

143
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,039
rca is a popular exercise of finding the

144
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,800
underlying cause of a problem

145
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,639
and this technique is useful because

146
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,320
when we work on the root cause

147
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,360
we are actually also finding many issues

148
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,080
associated

149
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,360
with it rc helps us to understand

150
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,680
how and why a problem occurred so you

151
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,199
can work on it and avoid it from

152
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,759
happening

153
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,080
again so basically you're not just

154
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,360
putting out fires

155
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,960
but you are ensuring that you don't

156
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,880
encounter the same problem in future

157
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,199
so it helps us to answer three basic

158
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,000
questions

159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,520
to address any problem what is the

160
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,320
problem

161
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,639
why did it happen and what can i do to

162
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,440
prevent it from happening again

163
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,759
basically you can apply rca in any

164
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,600
situation but however

165
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,520
to determine how far you need to go in

166
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,280
your investigation will depend on the

167
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,400
situation

168
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,280
and your judgment

169
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,360
so with that uh let's see how it makes

170
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,759
sense to have a rca in

171
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,160
secure software development lifecycle

172
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,680
what you see in front of you is the

173
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,319
typical flow of an s2dl or the software

174
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,720
secure software development lifecycle

175
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,360
and

176
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,440
we are very very much aware of the fact

177
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,160
that psirt or security response comes in

178
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
the utilization phase or

179
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,199
you know at the last phase of this cycle

180
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,759
however we perceive this as not only a

181
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,000
juncture for issue resolution

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,759
but also as a feedback channel to the

183
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,800
preceding phases of the process

184
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
and it is with these other teams that we

185
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,000
need to take some

186
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,960
time out after every patch day to

187
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,720
reflect on any learning so that we could

188
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,400
reduce repeated findings

189
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,319
and bring systematic improvements to the

190
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,960
life cycle

191
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,520
also we had a look at the psirt

192
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,560
framework

193
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,160
provided by first and we found that the

194
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,639
service 6.5 talks about

195
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,199
providing feedback mechanisms and it

196
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,479
says that

197
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,800
use information gained during the root

198
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
cause analysis of the incident

199
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,479
to educate the folks involved and

200
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,560
prevent similar vulnerabilities in

201
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,919
future

202
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,319
yes so we looked at it when we looked at

203
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,280
it we found that

204
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,120
it really makes sense and we should

205
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,800
incorporate this in our processes

206
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,440
so then we went and we started

207
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,039
discussing the concept with our

208
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,039
leadership and stakeholders

209
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,960
to see what is applicable and what

210
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,880
should be considered

211
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,720
and what kind of vulnerabilities should

212
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,319
be picked because

213
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,160
as we know that it is practically not

214
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,319
feasible to do an extensive root cause

215
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,560
analysis for every vulnerability that we

216
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,440
fix

217
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,400
yeah so after a couple of discussions we

218
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,240
came up with the

219
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,400
these three aspects that is who should

220
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,120
be the stakeholders of this exercise

221
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,759
which phases and services in studio

222
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,440
would be in scope of our

223
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,039
analysis and how are we going to

224
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,639
document our learnings

225
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,560
or the findings and insights of all the

226
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,319
analysis that we do and how are we going

227
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,680
to share it with the

228
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,879
stakeholders so once we

229
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,080
uh decided on the concept uh myself and

230
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,160
stuart we went back and started

231
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,240
you know putting down the details of how

232
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
we are going to implement and formalize

233
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
this as a process

234
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,400
and we started with the five step uh

235
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,199
five step rca process which is generally

236
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,160
available

237
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,960
and we adopted it to a four step process

238
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,879
which goes like this

239
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,039
uh the first step being defining the

240
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,280
problem so in this step

241
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,360
we actually you know at the at every

242
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,880
patch team we look at

243
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,320
all the vulnerabilities that we have

244
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,559
fixed and we try to identify

245
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,399
the vulnerabilities based on different

246
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,880
criteria which we want to analyze

247
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,120
and once we have identified those

248
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,800
vulnerabilities we start you know

249
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
gathering facts and information around

250
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,880
it by looking at the incidents

251
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,279
the security patches the affected

252
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,880
products and components

253
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,600
and who were the people involved in the

254
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,560
in this particular fix

255
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,720
and with that we move into the second

256
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,560
phase which is called the collect data

257
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,600
phase

258
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
wherein uh the part of it which we have

259
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,920
already done here we go a little bit a

260
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,360
step further

261
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,240
and we start conducting interviews or

262
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,839
you know deep discussions with the

263
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,000
experts that we have identified

264
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,040
from psi rt from the developers the

265
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,080
product owner

266
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,920
the security testing and validation

267
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,680
colleagues and so on

268
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,839
and we start you know understanding uh

269
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,320
their experiences of what went well what

270
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,040
could have been

271
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,640
improved and uh you know uh

272
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,880
all uh the timelines that were followed

273
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,000
the process that was

274
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,279
followed and so on and we don't just

275
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,519
you know focus only on the vulnerability

276
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,440
in question but we try to you know

277
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,560
look at it at a you know holistic way

278
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,279
to find out how the security measures

279
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,320
were implemented

280
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,040
in the whole product as such and we also

281
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,440
gathered the threat modeling reports

282
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,600
uh the sas tools scan reports or the

283
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,640
security validation reports and so on

284
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,399
and after collecting all this

285
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,000
information and the

286
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,680
experience sharing from different

287
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,120
experts

288
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,079
we go back and move to the third step

289
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:10,880
which is

290
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,600
about identifying the causes or the root

291
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
cause

292
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,320
now we sit and analyze all the artifact

293
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,120
artifacts that we have collected so far

294
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,160
and see how uh you know we could uh

295
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,279
the how we could improve the security

296
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,480
posture of this

297
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,640
product and what could have been done to

298
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,320
prevent this vulnerability

299
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,040
from occurring again in future we also

300
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,240
try to zero down

301
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,560
on the actual design or implementation

302
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,160
flaw that caused this vulnerability

303
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,640
and we try to document all these

304
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,320
findings and analysis

305
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,800
and recommendations in a structured

306
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,399
report

307
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,880
and with that we now move into the

308
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,959
fourth and final step which is recommend

309
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,880
and implement solutions

310
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,519
here uh the report that we have created

311
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,880
so far

312
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,800
putting across all our learnings and the

313
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,200
findings and recommendations

314
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,480
uh we you know structure it and share it

315
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,240
with the stakeholders

316
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,600
that we have identified and the

317
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,399
however the onus of implementing these

318
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,000
recommendations

319
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,120
lies with the uh lies with the

320
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,200
stakeholders from the business unit

321
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,920
but we do provide support and guidance

322
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,519
required on implementing these

323
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,440
recommendations

324
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,560
and which is basically uh you know

325
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,320
which concludes this four-step process

326
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,519
on a higher level and now what

327
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,440
we would like to you know show you the

328
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,040
detailed step-by-step

329
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,680
methodology that we follow uh while

330
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,200
doing a root cause analysis for a

331
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,959
vulnerability

332
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,040
uh so for that i would like to hand it

333
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,839
over to my colleague stuart

334
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,040
so over to used to work

335
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,200
so first of all coordination the pcr

336
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,040
team was asked to lead and coordinate

337
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,000
this activity

338
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,880
since our service encapsulates the

339
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,440
process

340
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,279
from the finding of a potential security

341
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,240
problem to an issue being resolved

342
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,399
from the outset the stakeholders had

343
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,160
agreed that they wanted to develop

344
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,720
a culture of transparency and openness

345
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,959
without fear of reprisals

346
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,839
this ethos is reflected in the reports

347
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,760
where we try to abstract

348
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,240
to a systemic level with highlighted

349
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,320
problems not focusing on a particular

350
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,480
individual

351
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,040
moreover we feel that constructive

352
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,320
critical analysis

353
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,839
should always try to propose

354
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,240
recommendations or potential solutions

355
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,519
that resonate with all stakeholders and

356
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,279
when choosing an incident

357
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,519
for rca we want to be on the same page

358
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,600
as our stakeholders and base our

359
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,920
decisions on either the criticality of

360
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,959
the finding

361
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,519
or other criteria such as quantity of

362
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,639
issues related

363
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,000
to the same product or recurrent issues

364
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,920
all available documents are shared so

365
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,839
that we have a common understanding this

366
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,279
also reveals

367
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,680
at an early stage any access issues that

368
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,360
a team may have for a particular

369
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,760
resource

370
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,399
so next slide so

371
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,399
execution on delivery so after having

372
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,000
read through the incident and related

373
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,200
documentation

374
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,880
we set up interviews with concerned

375
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,600
parties from the different phases of the

376
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,160
secure

377
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,560
software development life cycle we

378
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,680
usually assign

379
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,079
one note taker on one interviewer and

380
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,160
interfere being able to actively listen

381
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,839
to the interviewee's perspective of what

382
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,440
happened

383
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,519
it's also important to formulate an

384
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,360
opinion and not to ask questions that

385
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,240
lead interview to a desired outcome

386
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,600
straight after the interview we share

387
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,279
the minutes with the interviewee and

388
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,360
make corrections if necessary

389
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
we also have standardized our reports

390
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,120
for consistency purposes

391
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,199
and also this facilitates an aggregate

392
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,560
analysis over a certain time period

393
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,320
next slide so follow-up when the reports

394
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,000
are circulated the shareholder

395
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,480
stakeholders have an holistic view of

396
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,920
the problem

397
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,680
with different perspectives representing

398
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,040
the different phases of the secure sdl

399
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,639
they are also presented with

400
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,480
recommendations made by the team and

401
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,880
more often these are emanating directly

402
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,519
from the teams outlined in the report

403
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,600
there are follow-ups done to ensure that

404
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,120
improvements take place

405
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,040
we identify where learnings can be

406
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,880
disseminated and push this information

407
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,800
to different teams to document

408
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
in their trainings or wikis containing

409
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,160
best practices

410
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,639
the ultimate goal is not to have a

411
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,320
vulnerability type coming up again for a

412
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,600
particular product

413
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,440
and in the case that it does arise it is

414
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,199
tracked with a view to understanding why

415
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,120
it happened

416
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,360
so our experience stlc learnings

417
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,800
next slide so um

418
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,560
as mentioned earlier in the presentation

419
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,480
with root cause analysis

420
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,040
as well as reducing repeated findings we

421
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,959
wanted to test the hypothesis that the

422
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,680
phases and services were understood

423
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
based on our experience the overall

424
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,360
outcome was positive with minor

425
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,639
improvements recommended

426
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,279
in training tooling modeling

427
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,440
documentation and processes

428
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,000
in some instances we realize that whilst

429
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,680
it is good to have processes and tools

430
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,560
in place

431
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,160
it is necessary for different teams to

432
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,600
get together to troubleshoot on

433
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,199
configuration issues

434
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,360
improving test coverage or reducing true

435
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,480
problems or

436
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,680
false negatives other cases have shown a

437
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,360
need to go beyond the finding and look

438
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:29,680
for

439
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,959
other possible weaknesses

440
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,800
so next slide um when you have a mindset

441
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,759
that aims

442
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,440
towards prevention you can reduce

443
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,800
vulnerabilities

444
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,279
reduce errors through automation be open

445
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,040
to improving processes

446
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,279
and policies and discover problems that

447
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,199
may not have been obvious

448
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,360
the collaborative nature of rca lends

449
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,079
itself to fostering a sense of community

450
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,599
among security experts

451
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,680
next slide please yeah so uh when a

452
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,279
company has an open conversation a

453
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,079
methodology

454
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,800
to critically analyze and set up on

455
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,519
issues

456
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,600
it has a better chance to improve

457
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,519
working together to resolve issues

458
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,440
generates an environment of trust

459
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,320
awareness to collapse collaborate

460
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,240
finally mistakes can and will happen

461
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,000
however the goal should be to have a

462
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,399
mindset that is adaptable to change

463
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,320
and aim to reduce the recurrence of

464
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,600
issues

465
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,199
maybe shebra you would like to add

466
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,279
something here

467
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,360
yeah sure so yeah thanks to what for

468
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,720
walking us through those

469
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,600
retail steps and what i really want to

470
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,399
emphasize

471
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,360
here is that uh we as security

472
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,320
professionals

473
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
should function like engineers and not

474
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,160
just as gatekeepers

475
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,759
and we should definitely have the

476
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,839
mindset of let me help you build that

477
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,639
safe

478
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,040
and not use this exercise as a you know

479
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,360
way to finger point or find faults with

480
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,560
a particular

481
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,920
product or a team but use this

482
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,920
or utilize this for building a culture

483
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,920
of continuous learning and helping each

484
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,400
other improve as a community

485
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,480
so this mindset is really important for

486
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,079
any such exercise

487
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,799
and also uh this is a continuous process

488
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,439
of incorporating the learnings from rca

489
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,439
to update the security measures in our

490
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,559
sdlc

491
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,280
so this uh is not a one uh you know one

492
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,400
go thing which is

493
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,959
which will start and end but it is a

494
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,640
continuous process continuous learning

495
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,839
process yeah

496
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,640
so that being said uh we hope this gives

497
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:28,960
you

498
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,480
enough food for thought to get back to

499
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,000
your organizations and see

500
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,480
how you can implement it or if you

501
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,799
already have a matured rca

502
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,480
we would definitely like to hear your

503
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,600
experiences and stories

504
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,080
and with that we come to a conclusion

505
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,720
and

506
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,480
we you know we have shared our contact

507
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
details please do reach out to us to

508
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,400
share any comments or suggestions that

509
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,760
you would have

510
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,799
and uh thank you again for your time

511
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,200
and uh maybe we can you know take the

512
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,480
rest of the time to

513
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,320
answer the question the questions that

514
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,799
we have

515
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,559
so thank you sheepara and stuart um

516
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,400
so i had a question for you um

517
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,799
so stuart you showed us that you have

518
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,600
templates

519
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,039
to make things a bit easier for

520
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,960
everybody um

521
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,600
are those templates based on based off

522
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,280
of something or is it something you

523
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
developed completely on your own could

524
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,640
you kind of talk about the templates

525
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,160
that you have

526
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,240
oh maybe we can go back to that slide uh

527
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,280
sheep

528
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,039
so this is something that we developed

529
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,320
on our own

530
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,000
and so yeah definitely the structure

531
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,440
came

532
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,000
it took a couple of iterations and some

533
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,960
rcas

534
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,880
before we developed this uh final

535
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,240
structure and uh

536
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,640
well i say final but i um we're actually

537
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,520
looking

538
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,559
to add uh perhaps other factors into

539
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,280
this

540
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,400
as well for example looking at maybe

541
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,160
metrics measurements

542
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,440
and uh things like that

543
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,039
so yeah this is something that we have

544
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,200
developed ourselves

545
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,600
but of course um yeah if we're willing

546
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,320
to take feedback from

547
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,039
peers in pcert and uh even eventually

548
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,720
sharing this with first

549
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,080
and seeing how we can develop on

550
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:25,600
something like this

551
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,959
that's cinco you're on mute

552
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,160
oh sorry

553
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,720
so we have a question we have a question

554
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,520
from the audience

555
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,280
so the question is how do you manage rca

556
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,240
for software r

557
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,960
d that stretch across over 100 teams

558
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,240
wouldn't it be time consuming

559
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,440
yeah okay maybe i can take so right now

560
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,080
we do

561
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,760
uh you know rca for security

562
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,160
vulnerabilities

563
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,840
that are patched and these

564
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,160
vulnerabilities are reported by external

565
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,200
sources

566
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,200
usually researchers or customers so

567
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,240
ah and we uh you know uh utilize

568
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,880
this as uh as i mentioned the software

569
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,039
security development lifecycle maybe i

570
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:13,600
can

571
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:21,440
just move to that slide give me a second

572
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,480
yeah yeah

573
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,679
so uh the studio life cycle uh

574
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,760
is is our focus so uh every product uh

575
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,200
that you know is released with sap

576
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,679
goes through this cycle and these are

577
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,320
the various you know security procedures

578
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,960
that we follow starting from training

579
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,679
and

580
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,919
you know planning and risk assessment

581
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,159
and the development itself

582
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,240
and what kind of testing do we do within

583
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,840
development uh like the sas

584
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,679
and dust scans and so on so uh our focus

585
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,960
right now is uh you know uh on these

586
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,039
aspects of s2dl

587
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,200
uh whether we could improve anything in

588
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,159
the trainings

589
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,640
or you know or whether we have some

590
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,760
inputs to go back to the threat modeling

591
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,799
yeah so so we you know

592
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,200
look at these aspects and try to drive

593
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,000
the improvements in the respective teams

594
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
so right now we don't we are not dealing

595
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,600
with 100 teams we are dealing with the

596
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,200
product team

597
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
and the testing teams and the threat

598
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,600
modeling teams and so on yeah so

599
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,000
threat modeling and testing is mostly

600
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,760
done by the development and then we have

601
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,320
the

602
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,640
validation team separately and the

603
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,919
response team is

604
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,720
is us yeah so these are the four or five

605
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,559
teams basically in our focus

606
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,600
and even the set of people that we are

607
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,679
working with for a particular analysis

608
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,600
is ranges from not more than

609
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,400
probably you know or five to ten because

610
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,000
we want to be very specific

611
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,559
and not you know accumulate too much of

612
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,720
information from everywhere but

613
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,880
just focus on what the vulnerability we

614
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,960
are talking about and how we can

615
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,600
you know uh stop it from happening again

616
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,840
yeah

617
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,679
thank you okay i hope that dances yeah

618
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,400
yep um and if there are further

619
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,159
questions please submit them in the q a

620
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:18,960
box

621
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,520
so the next question is can you give

622
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,080
some

623
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,320
maybe sanitized examples of things

624
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,840
you've learned as part of this process

625
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,799
just what you want to uh start or should

626
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:35,679
i

627
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,039
um so sorry so sanitizer you mean that

628
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,000
some real cases like that uh i believe

629
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,840
this is some examples

630
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,400
um or and sanitize them if you need to i

631
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,200
think yeah yeah

632
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,480
sure um so basically uh what we've seen

633
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:50,880
is

634
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,159
as we mentioned and um in

635
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,080
the presentation uh so um

636
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,400
yeah we've come across uh cases whereby

637
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,679
we may have a finding

638
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,080
and uh yeah maybe teams should have

639
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,600
taken a bit more time to

640
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,200
um but if they've come up cooperate a

641
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,039
patch of course but maybe look at

642
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,320
different attack vectors and uh so we

643
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,520
spend a bit more time

644
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,080
um on the situation and uh so also for

645
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,360
uh threat modeling and um

646
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,480
yeah things like this um other cases

647
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,600
that come up for

648
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,120
uh as i mentioned about the false

649
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,159
positives and configuring tools properly

650
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,000
um so that you can get maybe a better

651
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,880
analysis on your code

652
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,320
so uh this happened whereby uh

653
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,799
teams took the default and they didn't

654
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,679
specify

655
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,320
um a configuration and for their needs

656
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,159
and uh so it just took

657
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,919
basically um people from different

658
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,520
departments getting together and talking

659
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,400
about

660
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,679
um how they configured it and so people

661
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,679
didn't realize basically that some

662
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,600
like two lean departments were also a

663
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,279
service that they could actually go on

664
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,400
and talk to and uh so um

665
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,120
definitely through rca this has helped

666
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,919
get people to

667
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,120
to collaborate to talk and uh yeah

668
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,879
to get better results basically

669
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,400
thank you so question after question

670
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,520
here so

671
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,320
next question is once you collect the

672
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,679
lessons learned

673
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,600
how do you ensure that they are really

674
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,120
considered and not forgotten

675
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,239
what are your strategies

676
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,159
so and i can start off cheaper you can

677
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,279
follow us

678
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,520
yeah yeah so uh basically this is

679
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,640
presented to

680
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,880
um the stakeholders and all the parties

681
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,159
in involved in

682
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,360
the form of a report and so our leaders

683
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,960
take it seriously and

684
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,840
they follow up with their peers in the

685
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,440
org charts so

686
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
so we take it from different angles from

687
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,200
bottom up and top down

688
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,039
and so um yeah

689
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,279
so that's our main strategy is that

690
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,000
and of course we have to to see that

691
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,440
things if things come up again then

692
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:05,919
obviously

693
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,360
it didn't work the message hasn't been

694
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,799
passed properly and so we have to visit

695
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,960
basically what's going on here um with

696
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,640
communication trainings and things like

697
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,679
that

698
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,520
and uh if you want to add

699
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,760
yeah i think you covered it yeah it's

700
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,039
it's actually the

701
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,600
it's the most valid question for this uh

702
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,039
you know exercise

703
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,039
that how do we ensure that the lessons

704
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,480
learned are taken up uh

705
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,320
seriously so yes stewart mentioned

706
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,600
i think the first step is uh you know to

707
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,640
drive it with the leadership and have

708
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,600
buy-in from

709
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,880
the business unit heads also that

710
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,760
they are strictly you know taking uh

711
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,840
taking it up for their units

712
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,880
and we also you know uh try to follow up

713
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,159
to an extent

714
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,880
but uh of course the development units

715
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,840
uh

716
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,240
are or the stakeholders are responsible

717
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,320
for driving them for their

718
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,440
proj uh products yeah so we cannot

719
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,559
more than uh an extent get into it but

720
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:10,960
we

721
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,159
you know try to regularly uh come back

722
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:14,400
and

723
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,120
if if we if for example if we have a you

724
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,679
know

725
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,760
uh vulnerability coming up again for the

726
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,679
same product and that is in our scope

727
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:21,919
and

728
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,320
definitely we take that chance to see

729
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:24,960
where we

730
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,480
you know our uh where was the report

731
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,400
from the last time was it how much was

732
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,159
it taken seriously and were there any

733
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,360
improvements done

734
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,400
for that yeah so that is one way that we

735
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:36,880
do

736
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,520
but yeah we also rely on the business

737
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
unit stakeholders to drive it for their

738
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,080
teams yes

739
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,039
okay so we have maybe one and a half two

740
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,320
minutes left so

741
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,440
maybe final question um so

742
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,200
one question how do you handle

743
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,480
vulnerabilities in

744
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,400
end-of-life products uh so um

745
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,159
yeah maybe this question is kind of out

746
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,240
of scope for this presentation as we're

747
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,840
looking at root cause analysis

748
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,070
methodologies um so yeah

749
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,200
[Music]

750
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,400
that's uh a question for vulnerability

751
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,480
handling in general but this is uh

752
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,520
kind of other scope for this

753
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,000
presentation okay

754
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,240
um so next question i think will be our

755
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,600
final question

756
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
um you mentioned about the use of threat

757
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,200
modeling in your process will you be

758
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,840
able to

759
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,600
share the type of threat modeling tools

760
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,520
that you use in helping to identify and

761
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,200
perform rca

762
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,240
uh yeah first of all i don't think we

763
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,640
can

764
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,360
you know disclose the tools that we use

765
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,080
inside

766
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,159
uh sap and also uh we don't use any

767
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,039
threat modeling

768
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,960
tools for rca i mean uh for doing rca

769
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,399
it's basically

770
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,039
you know talking to people and finding

771
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:55,840
out facts

772
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,799
and documenting the facts and so on so

773
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,200
there is no tool involved in

774
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,120
performing in rca as such and

775
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,240
just coming to threat modeling tools i

776
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,480
don't think we can name yesterday

777
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,039
yeah just to say that we have access to

778
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,039
resources as mentioned the presentation

779
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,279
to artifacts

780
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,679
so we can we can access things that have

781
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,120
been done already

782
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,120
you know as any analysis that has been

783
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,880
done

784
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,399
so we take this into account okay

785
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,520
with that i think we are under

786
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,640
um less than one minute um so

787
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,679
it is at half past now so please um let
