we are a digital security facility that

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
provides the free of charge incident

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,479
response to the civil society

36
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,240
so civil society members such as

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,400
journalists and human rights defenders

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
are very targeted online

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,280
uh usually uh under-resourced to invest

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,840
in their

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,040
online defenses they are always uh

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,280
targeted by attacks most of the time due

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,119
to their work

44
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,320
uh the adversaries could go from script

45
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,200
kiddies to

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,320
the most advanced groups

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,280
there is so there is a need to protect

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,079
these

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,600
groups groups which pushed many

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,040
organizations

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,079
nonprofits to create and form teams to

52
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,360
provide

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,000
technical support and defenses for these

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,840
at risk users however and do the lack of

55
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,000
capabilities infrastructures sometimes

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,120
funds uh information sharing they were

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,520
never

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,879
up to the scale of adversaries

59
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,239
attacks until they started to unite

60
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,080
their efforts

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
today i'm here with some colleagues to

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,239
tell you about the

63
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,319
series earth which is one of these

64
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,520
coalitions that

65
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,160
was formed to defend uh the civil

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,800
society

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,840
so uh what's uh c

68
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,040
cert uh series cert is not a cert

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,440
nor stock it's a coalition of

70
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,360
organizations that provide incident

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,800
response and

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,760
cyber security support to the civil

73
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200
society members

74
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,000
some of its numbers are part of first

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,720
namely

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,840
my organization accessnow

77
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,480
the common and rest of this coalition is

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,040
the

79
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,959
the need to provide cyber security

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,280
support to the most at risk users around

81
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,560
the world

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,640
the reality that each of our

83
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,599
organizations

84
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,480
lacks something to be fully be prepared

85
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,760
to help our

86
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,200
beneficiaries whether it's technical uh

87
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,800
capabilities language local physical

88
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,840
presence uh contacts pushes

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,319
us to join forces in order to

90
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,200
collaborate

91
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,480
and provide the needed support

92
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,599
uh how cb cert got born

93
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,120
so civilized came out from a previous

94
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,680
effort

95
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,080
done by a coalition called the rar net

96
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,879
which is

97
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,360
the first attempt to bring civil society

98
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,080
defend

99
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,280
defenders uh together and that was

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,120
around

101
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,840
2013 then around

102
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,640
2016 uh civicer got born

103
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,120
in order to attract more local uh

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,239

the coalition mandate being part of

civil cert provides the members

114
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,440

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,319
yes we see okay okay

177
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,520
all right so yes since 2010 uh equality

178
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,280
operators are not for profit

179
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,240
with a mandate to develop technology and

180
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,960
services

181
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,160
that help protect and promote human

182
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,479
rights on the internet

183
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,360
um we have been a member of civilizate

184
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,840
for

185
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,400
several years now before the environment

186
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,000
and we have gone through

187
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,440
the kind of pains and the tribulations

188
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,960
of cooperative work in this rather

189
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,560
sensitive and complicated field

190
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
so i will be talking about how our

191
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
collaboration with other civic members

192
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,759
such as accessnow

193
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,360
amnesty international aquarium

194
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,599
foundation has helped

195
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,720
our work and has helped the results

196
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,440
of our investigative reporting into

197
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,080
attacks

198
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,520
against deflect clients as

199
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,680
probably quite a lot of you know here

200
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,360
threat information sharing

201
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,479
attribution secure infrastructure and

202
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,000
incident response

203
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,199
you know addressing all of these

204
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,039
challenges really requires

205
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,599
an effective community collaboration

206
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,080
which is

207
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,160
one of the reasons for this first

208
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,039
conference as well

209
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,280
so the next few slides again will show

210
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,560
you how

211
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
our projects help to mitigate attacks

212
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
and expose threat actors

213
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,039
and their attempts to disrupt the just

214
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,759
work of

215
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,399
media and civic movements online

216
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,839
you're seeing your notes and your slides

217
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,120
oh you're seeing both

218
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,279
yes

219
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,200
how about now still seeing the same

220
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,839
note in the slide

221
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,360
and now still the same size

222
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,600
it's one of those mornings no worries

223
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,720
if you want to real quick try unsharing

224
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
and then re-sharing

225
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,839
yeah maybe i'll do that just one second

226
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,360
bear with us folks just a few little

227
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,560
technical difficulties

228
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,080
the joys that we're all getting used to

229
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:05,839
with the with virtual conferences

230
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,359
okay all right i will just

231
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:33,839
i have to do it like this

232
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:47,839
disc typically

233
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,839
okay i go to the safe pdf

234
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,800
okay and share

235
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,720
there we go my apologies for that

236
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,839
perfect thank you

237
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,680
okay so um back to the presentation

238
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,519
thank you everybody sorry again

239
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,560
so the deflect infrastructure is a

240
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,440
caching and attack mitigation uh service

241
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,600
that we provide since 2011

242
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,000
in defense of human rights on the

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,959
internet

244
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,920
over 500 websites and over a million

245
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,120
daily readers

246
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,839
access deflect protected content every

247
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,160
day

248
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,920
many of these clients of our clients

249
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,480
come as referrals from city cert members

250
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,120
including accessnow internews and others

251
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,320
deflect offers

252
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,639
a free service to non-profit and civil

253
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,560
society groups online when we do offer

254
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,600
the service

255
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,959
we require um an eligibility check

256
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,440
and it really helps us to be part of the

257
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,399
cbso

258
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,399
network as well when we're doing

259
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,560
eligibility checking of new websites to

260
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,160
make sure that they conform

261
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,399
to the rules of uh the deflect service

262
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,200
on average we mitigate around five to

263
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,760
ten

264
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,360
weekly incidents um we've witnessed

265
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,760
quite large attacks over the years uh

266
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,279
some of them comprising tens of

267
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,720
thousands of bots

268
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,120
and generating traffic up to a terabyte

269
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,279
per second

270
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,040
deflect clients come from all around the

271
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,880
world and represent

272
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,120
civic society investigative media human

273
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,880
rights organizations

274
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,240
ecologists women's rights so on

275
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,360
uh and so forth

276
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,360
now occasionally we also look into the

277
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,000
attacks

278
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,040
that have been lodged against our our

279
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
customers our clients

280
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,120
uh we do this for several reasons one is

281
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,959
obviously to expose the methods being

282
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,560
used and possibly shut down some of the

283
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
malicious infrastructure

284
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,720
uh which was being used in the attack

285
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,760
another and i guess a

286
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,639
much more important outcome is to help

287
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,639
the advocacy efforts of the targeted

288
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,399
websites themselves

289
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,040
not only does the attack not succeed

290
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,079
because deflect

291
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,959
might be in front of it and the

292
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,800
perpetrator's methods exposed but the

293
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,079
website that they were trying to bring

294
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,760
down actually becomes more popular if

295
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,360
we're able to publish reporting

296
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,959
especially that which is picked up by

297
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,079
the media

298
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,760
and so the aims of the attackers kind of

299
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,160
swore it turned around 180 degrees

300
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,839
and we actually help the targeted

301
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,519
website become more popular

302
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,680
by the virtue of attacks launched

303
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
against them this is the ideal scenario

304
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,040
of course it doesn't happen every time

305
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,440
but

306
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,440
it does happen and i'd like to speak

307
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,480
about

308
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,079
two cases where this scenario did arise

309
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,160
so um in 2018

310
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,360
okay sorry

311
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,959
in 2018 uh we'll be looking into adidas

312
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,959
attack against the prominent

313
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,600
independent media covering central asian

314
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,160
current affairs

315
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,760
we'd noticed that the taxes were

316
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,199
deploying professional

317
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,240
vulnerability scanning tools looking at

318
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,120
the traces left by these tools

319
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,399
and into the history of our logs

320
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,240
we trace the same techniques to attacks

321
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,639
against other deflect lines also from

322
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,320
the same region

323
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,920
we managed to locate and scan the cnc

324
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,079
discovering open smtp ports and

325
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,720
multiple phishing domains resolving to

326
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,519
the same origin

327
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,959
now this led to two different

328
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,120
investigations one that deflect

329
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,240
pursued by itself and one that was later

330
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,120
picked up

331
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,480
by the amnesty tech team

332
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,800
we discovered in addition to ddos

333
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,839
attacks

334
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,000
that multiple members of the uzbek

335
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,519
expatriate

336
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,320
human rights community were on the

337
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,600
receiving end

338
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,720
of a fishing campaign campaign

339
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,600
over two years that was originating from

340
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,000
the same

341
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,040
service that we used to control the ddos

342
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,439
attack

343
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,000
the second threat of this investigation

344
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,079
the fishing campaign

345
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,639
was picked up as i mentioned by members

346
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,839
of the amnesty

347
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,000
technology team also a civic cert member

348
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,199
and for the exploration um

349
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,040
discovering and

350
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,600
looking at the internals of the malware

351
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,440
as well as multiple interviews

352
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,320
led to their publication this march of a

353
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,519
report

354
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,839
titled targeted surveillance attacks in

355
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,759
uzbekistan an old threat

356
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,240
with new techniques which is available

357
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,519
on the amnesty website

358
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,600
so this joint reporting the first and

359
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,440
the second was made possible by our

360
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,079
ability

361
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,560
to share sensitive information and

362
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,759
contact details

363
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,639
and various iocs between our various

364
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,000
organizations

365
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,920
obviously with the consent of

366
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,120
participating parties

367
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,120
i think it's important here to point out

368
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,880
that each member of the civic cert

369
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,560
community brings specific

370
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,639
and particular expertise to this

371
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,079
community

372
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,600
our ability to collaborate with each

373
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,360
other empowers

374
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,079
the results of our individual and our

375
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,360
group work we are able

376
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,320
to bring in specific expertise specific

377
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,440
resources

378
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,839
that each individual member being

379
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,399
usually a not for profit

380
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,440
a small civil society organization does

381
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,240
not have

382
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,759
access to all at once

383
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,120
and i'd like to go back a little bit

384
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,680
further in time and talk about a case

385
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,839
uh that occurred in 2016

386
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,199
we were performing um several

387
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,480
investigations

388
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,119
into attacks against the black lives

389
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,919
matter website on deflect

390
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,480
we revealed the four months campaign

391
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,160
with over 120

392
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,640
separate incidents in that campaign that

393
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,000
was supposedly led

394
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,079
by members of the ghost squad hackers

395
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,319
group

396
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,200
during this investigation and working

397
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,360
closely with citizen member queering

398
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,960
foundation who is renowned

399
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,320
in our field for doing digital forensics

400
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,600
and attack investigations we were able

401
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,400
to pinpoint some of the ips uh used by

402
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,280
attackers

403
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,520
as commanding control nodes for the

404
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,240
various incidents

405
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,919
this allowed us to attribute events

406
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,360
announced on

407
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,720
different hacker forums with data coming

408
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,679
through our networks

409
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,679
you know for the first time we really

410
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,039
felt empowered

411
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,679
to not only mitigate these attacks but

412
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,559
to actually

413
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,760
capture and pursue some of these

414
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,320
attackers and attacks post factum

415
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,000
so we turn from i guess being sort of a

416
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,440
uh internet punching bag uh

417
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,640
into a team that can perform

418
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,240
detail investigations can pursue

419
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,320
various ips and various techniques

420
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,440
around the internet

421
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,799
with the help of other city cert members

422
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,000
my final slide is a proposal

423
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,760
about a next type of collaboration

424
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,640
that we're pursuing here at deflect

425
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,360
threat information sharing

426
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,480
um is a complicated and i guess a very

427
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:52,960
sort of

428
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,880
privacy sensitive topic as well

429
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,799
a deep level of trust and robust

430
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,559
policies as hassan mentioned are

431
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,360
required

432
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,520
for the exchange of what is often

433
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,039
personal data

434
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,240
in the indicators of compromise

435
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,000
and also in a manner that could help

436
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,520
prevent incidents elsewhere in the

437
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
network

438
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,200
and deflect with building a

439
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,880
clearinghouse that will enable the

440
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,200
exchange of ip behavior

441
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,720
at the network edge as vector features

442
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,960
in return the clearinghouse will reply

443
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,360
with an anomaly prediction scoring

444
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,880
as generated by baskerville which is a

445
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,520
deflect built machine learning platform

446
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,360
for layer 7 attack mitigation

447
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,200
so we're proposing that the

448
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,679
clearinghouse will allow the exchange

449
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,480
of um

450
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,600
allow the exchange of non-ioc data

451
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,840
for the purposes of being able to

452
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,400
receive a prediction and generate

453
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,320
an appropriate mitigation response on

454
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,240
your own networks

455
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,080
you can read more about all of this on

456
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,400
the deflect website and

457
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,520
on the equality website as well thank

458
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,440
you hasan thank you everybody sorry for

459
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,880
the

460
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,919
slide sharing troubles

461
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,559
yeah thanks geometry and that was a very

462
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,200
good

463
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
illustrative examples on how

464
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,039
collaboration between uh

465
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,159
the semi-cert coalitions led to really

466
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,159
good

467
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,360
results now with night through the

468
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,840
digital

469
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,559
rights foundation helpline you are

470
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,240
negative helping

471
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,480
women minorities and dissidents who are

472
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,320
facing many kinds of threats

473
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,960
could you give us a further example of

474
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,200
collaboration that exists between

475
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,880
the coalition members thank you

476
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,120
i'll be very quick since we have andrej

477
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,360
with us and we are running out of time

478
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,480
um so we uh at digital rise foundation

479
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,000
in pakistan we started a cyber

480
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,440
harassment helpline

481
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,640
in 2016 and the idea was to uh

482
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,760
not only uh provide digital security

483
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,520
support but also

484
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,440
especially young women and girls

485
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,520
feminists minorities groups

486
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,760
who are very hesitant to reach out to

487
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,000
the law enforcement or other actors

488
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
uh due to the fear of uh being

489
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,120
prosecuted

490
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,919
um they they started reaching out to us

491
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:22,880
through the helpline

492
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,280
and um not just for the digital security

493
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,679
support but also getting advice on legal

494
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,520
health but also you know like

495
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,200
investigations around what is happening

496
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,360
to their devices or if their devices are

497
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,720
acting up and

498
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,840
so uh in um two years ago

499
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,880
uh we got a complaint from um

500
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,440
a woman human rights defender who

501
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,039
basically a peace activist

502
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,080
was campaigning around uh enforced

503
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,159
disappearances in pakistan

504
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,000
and uh she um

505
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,760
she and so the older human rights

506
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,880
activists in pakistan

507
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,440
actually really have no idea uh when

508
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,120
they use social media uh

509
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,200
accounts or platforms for their activism

510
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,960
about the digital security

511
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,880
but her phone started acting up and she

512
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,559
reached out to us and

513
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,320
we as a small organization really

514
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,559
couldn't you know like find

515
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,720
that what what exactly is happening and

516
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,919
referred the case

517
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,000
uh to one of the organization and due to

518
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,760
the security reasons i cannot name the

519
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,960
organization

520
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,760
but uh we referred the case to the civic

521
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,880
cert member

522
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,360
and the initially they started looking

523
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,799
into her devices but

524
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,159
later that uh investigation led to a

525
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,039
larger

526
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,520
investigation in a very detailed manner

527
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,799
and resulted in a

528
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,440
research study and found out that not

529
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,840
just

530
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,960
one activist is facing this kind of

531
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,760
uh targeted malware attack but a very

532
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,000
sophisticated targeted malware attack is

533
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,280
happening against

534
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,760
several human rights defenders and women

535
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,000
human rights defenders in pakistan

536
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,960
so uh that investigation led to you know

537
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,280
uh

538
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,440
awareness raising among human rights

539
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,480
groups not just

540
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,159
working on digital rights but also

541
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,679
traditional human rights groups and

542
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,559
older ones

543
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,720
uh and the way and the second case is a

544
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,400
very generic case where

545
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,799
you know they're like sophisticated

546
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,080
complaints that we

547
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,520
uh receive and um we as

548
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,760
also local organization do not have that

549
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,640
advanced tech

550
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,280
knowledge due to the lack of resources

551
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,840
uh

552
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,320
we refer those cases to the access now

553
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,280
helpline

554
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,320
and it's a very uh mutual uh sort of

555
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,360
relationship because

556
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,080
we as a digital rights foundation a

557
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,000
feminist led organization always

558
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,799
have a gender aspect towards digital

559
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,320
security or digital rights

560
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,760
um and um so access now also reaches out

561
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,799
to us in terms of

562
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,400
what are the things that they can do as

563
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
a helpline uh

564
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,320
in terms of you know uh addressing the

565
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,080
issues of women human rights defenders

566
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,880
or feminist

567
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,760
uh uh feminist led organizations or just

568
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,640
feminists

569
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,960
so this is that's how i feel that you

570
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,799
know the referral mechanism within civic

571
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,279
cert

572
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,159
has been helping small organization uh

573
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:04,880
in terms of

574
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,000
uh conducting investigations and

575
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,720
researches

576
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,039
and helping human rights defenders on

577
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:11,760
the ground

578
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,240
at the same time increasing our all our

579
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,840
knowledge as well which we

580
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,720
usually cannot really get due to the

581
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,640
lack of resources and lack of

582
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,520
funding as well so i'll end here and

583
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,240

the introduction and

597
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,760
sorry for being a bit late uh as as a

598
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,200
small organization

599
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,840
coming from the balkans to be more

600
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,279
precise from serbia

601
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,440
we've been facing various types of

602
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,799
challenges uh

603
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,360
in in our local context uh bearing in

604
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,720
mind that serbia is a country that's

605
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,640
still not a member of the european union

606
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,760
we still have

607
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,240
struggles with rule of law and freedom

608
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,360
of the media

609
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,640
our cert is mostly oriented towards

610
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,080
helping

611
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,200
ngos civil set organizations activists

612
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,039
and media when it comes to cyber

613
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,360
incidents in that regard international

614
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,960
cooperation for us is of vital

615
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,000
importance

616
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,320
due to the fact that uh we are the only

617
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,240
organization in the wider region

618
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,799
that deals with these issues uh having

619
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,679
said that

620
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,640
becoming a part of civilized has helped

621
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,600
us

622
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
gain experience and knowledge of things

623
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,440
that happen on a more global

624
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,720
level since our focus is quite regional

625
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,279
and has really contributed greatly to

626
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:53,919
the work

627
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,799
that we we do on daily basis not only

628
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,240
when it comes to the technical aspects

629
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,799
because

630
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,200
uh in that regard we do have uh some

631
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,039
sort of capacity to

632
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,039
uh basically respond to the incidences

633
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,960
that we've been facing but more

634
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,400
uh on the on the global trends also

635
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
it is very important to stress out that

636
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,880
the entire system of digital security

637
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,760
in serbia is still basically in the

638
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,600
making because there is some legal

639
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,480
framework but

640
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,039
it has not been established to to its

641
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,880
full extent meaning that

642
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,480
we do take active part in advocacy and

643
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,360
um basically policy policy policy

644
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,720
shaping for which

645
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,640
international standards and experience

646
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,919
is of um

647
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,120
vital vital importance to to

648
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,559
to us um yeah so uh

649
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,400
it is really important for a small

650
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,760
organization such as

651
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,200
our own to have to have uh connections

652
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,679
with

653
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,960
with uh global organizations and to

654
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,760
basically be able to contribute with our

655
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,360
two cents and knowledge and experience

656
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,159
from our region which

657
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,000
remains uncovered from others

658
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,880
thanks adrie uh so uh yeah i was

659
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,400
planning to speak more about

660
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,799
the internal resource that we provide

661
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,440
for our organization's members

662
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,559
but since we are not we are

663
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,039
not really following our schedule and we

664
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,880
are busy i just i want to see if we have

665
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,559
any questions from the audience if you

666
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,080
would type those in the q

667
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,279
a box um otherwise please

668
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,559
please keep speaking i'll let you know

669
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,799
if we get a question here

670
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,440
all right uh so speaking about internal

671
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,240
resources

672
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,000
we have um an internal uh

673
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,640
reporting policy that every organization

674
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,120
should

675
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,679
follow to report the cases that they are

676
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,480
working on

677
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,320
trends and

678
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,640
techniques and campaigns that targeting

679
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,559
civil society in addition to that we

680
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,919
have a

681
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,279
mis instance where we are pushing uh

682
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,559
indicator of compromises that we see on

683
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,679
cases so if there is any uh

684
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,320
need for that our organization can use

685
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,399
it and also it allows us to be

686
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,880
more uh proactive dealing with the cases

687
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,080
also we are um

688
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,120
we are developing our tools and

689
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,159
internal documentations to uh respond to

690
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:24,559
many

691
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,520
