presenting for this session so

32
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,759
i'm carla gregado and i'm a threat

33
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,360
researcher at trent micro

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,520
and i work mainly on web threat in-depth

35
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,479
analysis

36
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,479
and creating solution using machine

37
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,079
learning application

38
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,600
and uh we also have joy hi joy hi

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,240
so good day everyone i'm joy avelina

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,280
also from trend

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,079
micro and i've specialized in

42
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,920
application of machine learning i've

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,560
previously worked with malware

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,719
also network and now i'm currently

45
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,799
immersed in web threats

46
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:09,840
so to start this presentation

47
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,920
uh i'd like to start this presentation

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,440
with the

49
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,720
word big data every day 2.5

50
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,280
quintillion bytes of data has been

51
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,520
transmitted over the internet

52
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,560
and of course threat data is no no

53
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,280
exception to this

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,400
so uh since with the fast-paced

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,959
technology of cloud of iot

56
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,360
uh threat actors cyber criminals are

57
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,640
also adapting

58
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,519
and tweaking today their data by uh

59
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,280
tweaking old threats to evade

60
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,840
new detection

61
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,080
and with the current generation of

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
threats

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,000
that is big data the current pipeline

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,440
that is analysis

65
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,239
and plus solution might not be able to

66
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,319
keep up so

67
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,879
this we turn to machine learning so with

68
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,640
the use of web threats

69
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,239
we extract features feed it in the model

70
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,560
and from there there will be uh

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,400
solutions and we gather

72
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,040
threat intelligence from from there i

73
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,720
give the

74
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,879
the slides now to carla to explain the

75
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,720
features some of the features

76
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,920
we extracted from web

77
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,840
to uh formulate it and feed it to the

78
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,159
model all right

79
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,599
thank you joy so

80
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,080
in this slide as you can see these are

81
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,720
the sites that are mostly visited

82
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,840
this year based on alexa top site data

83
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,519
so due to pandemic that we are

84
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,040
encountering this year

85
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,120
more people are now doing their stuff

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,080
online

87
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,400
and from this data we can see that

88
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,000
google and youtube

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
seems to be the most in-demand online

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,080
platform that everyone is using

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,560
so from this basic information actually

92
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,200
we

93
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,599
this can be a baseline of our data

94
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,319
analysis

95
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,319
as we deep dive in the current web

96
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,439
threat landscape

97
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,200
and how we can create a better solution

98
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,920
so in this day and age we can easily get

99
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,680
different data from different sources

100
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,079
right

101
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,478
and most of the time we tend to have a

102
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,040
lot or like a millions of data every day

103
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,680
and in the field of data science knowing

104
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,840
which data are significant gives us an

105
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,000
opportunity to create strong features

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,320
for machine learning so it is very

107
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,720
important to have a keen observation

108
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,600
whenever we do we see some patterns or

109
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,440
unusual behavior especially if we are

110
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,320
dealing with phishing urls

111
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,560
so let's have a quick trip down to

112
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,440
memory lane

113
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,759
of what happened in the previous months

114
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,840
and how fishing took advantage of the

115
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,919
different events this year

116
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,800
so first uh one of the unfortunate event

117
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
that we are still dealing up until today

118
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,840
is the kovid 19 pandemic and it even

119
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,199
costs a lot of lives

120
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,520
around the globe and some even loses

121
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,560
their jobs

122
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,720
so doing our stuff online suddenly

123
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,919
becomes the new norm

124
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,240
and the usage of in the cloud service

125
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,320
became a necessity

126
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,240
and some of the major effect of this

127
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,720
kind of event in the world wide web is

128
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,440
first uh there comes the massive fishing

129
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,039
or scum urls

130
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,000
that are related to covet 19. so cyber

131
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,240
criminal took advantage of the human's

132
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,160
necessity for information

133
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,039
especially nowadays everyone wants to be

134
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:29,840
informed

135
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,680
and everyone wants to know it what is

136
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,400
happening so they created a lot of fake

137
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,720
websites that conveys fraud or deceiving

138
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,840
information

139
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,080
like fake statistics fake software

140
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,039
application

141
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,400
or even some fake login page related to

142
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,560
cdc

143
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,199
and then there's also a huge demand of

144
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,080
work from home

145
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,039
setup that leads to more phishing urls

146
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:53,600
some

147
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,319
are targeted related to online video

148
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,319
communication applications like zoom

149
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,000
or even microsoft teams and uh finally

150
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,080
as we try to stay at home um it's

151
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,400
also even uh we tried to stay safe

152
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,919
especially the children

153
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,960
so we started to do online classes and

154
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,759
it became the new way of learning

155
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,919
cyber criminal took advantage of this

156
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,759
one by creating phishing campaigns

157
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,680
related to online classes

158
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,440
and actually last june there was a

159
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
massive phishing campaign targeting

160
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
education industry in the uk

161
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,919
so this kind of information is very

162
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,479
important as we study and learn the kind

163
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,639
of fishing urls that are we are that we

164
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,639
are dealing with

165
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,560
so now that we know what are the

166
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,639
possible target of fishing

167
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,440
so let's look first the old and new

168
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,080
tricks

169
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
being used in the fishing attack so

170
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,120
actually last year

171
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,840
there was a rise of fishing urls related

172
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,280
to pdf fish

173
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,479
wherein it um mostly arrived by a email

174
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,440
attachment

175
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,560
wherein the attachment contains a

176
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,000
phishing url link so uh besides from

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,280
the pdf fish uh we also have the

178
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,199
typo squatting actually this is an old

179
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,400
technique uh but

180
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,039
still effective uh these days so this

181
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,080
technique takes advantage of human error

182
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,560
where in it a human having misspelled

183
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
word in the domain name while typing it

184
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,599
in the browser

185
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,919
so this type of technique is also seen

186
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,720
being used

187
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,880
in the phishing or scam urls that are

188
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,520
related to copied 19.

189
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,240
so from all tricks so what are the new

190
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,720
tricks that we are seeing nowadays

191
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,599
so in a recent study or analysis we

192
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,919
observed that the most of the phishing

193
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,199
urls uh now are used now are using a

194
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,840
sharing services or cloud applications

195
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,080
so we notice that the common sharing

196
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,160
services or cloud applications being

197
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,680
used nowadays are

198
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,759
one drive sharepoint upbox or sendgrid

199
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,919
so the idea of this kind of phishing

200
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,120
attack is that

201
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,599
it will post like sharing a file let's

202
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,000
say a pdf file for example

203
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
then it will requires the attention of

204
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,479
the victim by downloading or opening the

205
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,479
file just to find out that it contains a

206
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,000
phishing url

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
actually it's quite similar with pdf

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,759
fish that i've mentioned earlier

209
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,080
but this time it uses online sharing

210
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,440
services

211
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,400
so um and also as they passes by it

212
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,000
became more complicated

213
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,639
um as the technique involves a chain of

214
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,520
series of uh phishing redirection

215
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,319
so uh what happens is that um it will

216
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,159
redirect to several

217
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,640
other sharing services before it goes to

218
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,719
the final landing page of the actual

219
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,039
fishing site

220
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,760
and uh actually uh this one can be

221
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,039
easily observed

222
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,360
via manual analysis but it might be

223
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,240
difficult

224
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,560
if there are millions of urls having

225
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,640
this kind of uh behavior

226
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,000
so how are we gonna deal with the

227
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,080
millions of urls so with the

228
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,720
aid of machine learning it can help us

229
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,600
deal with this kind of dilemma

230
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,720
so uh besides from that we also

231
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,440
uh saw or observed a new technique that

232
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:05,920
uh

233
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,320
recently used wherein it involves

234
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,959
phishing url or actually phishing email

235
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,519
where in the accomplice or is the

236
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,800
ransomware attack

237
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,519
especially today that rio ransomware is

238
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,320
a hot threat targeting big industries

239
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,959
so you may also notice in the screenshot

240
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,720
of the sample phishing email

241
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,080
the ur the url link being used is google

242
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,279
docs which is

243
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,600
uh for us it is also another type of

244
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,040
sharing services

245
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,279
so this may be very hard for the machine

246
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,160
to predict

247
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,200
especially for a type of service

248
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,959
for this type of services so the idea is

249
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,200
as long as we know how the url behaves

250
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,040
we can create a feature

251
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,600
that the machine can learn and even can

252
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
help us identify or predict

253
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,040
which are most likely to be malicious

254
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,600
so there are actually two important

255
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,519
factors in creating a feature

256
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,680
so that the machine can predict the

257
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,120
phishing urls

258
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,760
so first we have the physical aspect of

259
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,560
the url

260
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,360
which is based on url construction and

261
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,720
then we also have the

262
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,640
web content or the source code of the

263
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,120
url actually there are different python

264
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,160
libraries

265
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,200
for creating a future creation or for

266
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,320
doing features so

267
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,560
first things to consider on url

268
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,760
construction so

269
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,399
we can consider the length of the url so

270
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,560
we can have a training set of urls that

271
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,320
the machine will try to learn

272
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,959
if let's say for example is it possible

273
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,800
that the longer the url

274
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,320
it is more malicious or is it if the url

275
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,480
is shorter there is more possibility of

276
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,240
having a normal content

277
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,360
something like that and then we can also

278
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,000
uh look for a special characters in the

279
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,120
domain name

280
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,600
so how high is the possibility that if

281
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,399
the url contains special characters

282
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,800
they are most likely created for

283
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,880
malicious intent than using in normal

284
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,920
purposes

285
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,320
so usually this is observed um in the

286
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,279
technique called

287
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,040
type of squatting which i mentioned

288
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,279
earlier and for this one actually we can

289
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,079
also use the what they call levenshtein

290
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,160
distance if you're familiar with it

291
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,640
so it is a tech similarity that measures

292
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,959
or compares two words on let's say how

293
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:19,680
similar

294
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,040
or how different they are

295
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,640
and then we also have um

296
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,360
we can also check for urls that contain

297
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,880
suspicious keywords

298
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,519
that are commonly seen in phishing urls

299
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,519
so we can have the machine predict

300
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,519
if those certain keywords are always

301
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,360
true in phishing urls

302
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,880
and seldom seen on legitimate ones

303
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,040
and then finally we can also check for

304
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,600
urls that contains another url so it's

305
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,440
like url within the url

306
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,600
so what are the probabilities of having

307
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,079
malicious redirection from urls that

308
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,959
contains another url so these are just

309
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,440
some points or possible features of

310
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,760
checking the url construction

311
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,120
so how about the url content so

312
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,200
uh having a closer look on the source

313
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,079
code source code or web content how we

314
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,839
can do web scraping

315
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,440
and there are a lot of different

316
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,200
platforms that can be used in web

317
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,000
scraping

318
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,560
so for now we can use the most common

319
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,120
one which is the beautiful soup

320
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,800
so what is web scraping web scraping

321
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,200
is the idea of extracting data from

322
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,839
websites so it can be the html tags or

323
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,000
its attributes etc

324
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,480
the main idea is to look for some red

325
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,120
flags

326
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,760
or suspicious code or keywords that can

327
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,800
be a strong

328
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,079
indicator of phishing content

329
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,600
so uh do you remember the pdf fish that

330
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,880
i've mentioned earlier

331
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,399
so we found out in our study last year

332
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,880
that most of the url downloader

333
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,360
related to pdf fish contains file

334
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,120
extension different file extension

335
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,320
either pdf

336
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,519
xa or etc um

337
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,519
in this study we can we we observed that

338
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,560
the title tags that contain um

339
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,720
file extension which is actually not

340
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,880
normally seen on the legitimate web

341
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,839
content

342
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,920
so from here we can extract the

343
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,600
information and title tags

344
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,680
on every web content and create a

345
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
meaningful feature and probably

346
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,480
identify the possible urls that might

347
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,440
download

348
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,200
apdfish and then

349
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,480
another example could be

350
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,959
we can also look for html tags where the

351
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,320
malicious url

352
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,800
or let's say another fishing url that

353
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,720
might be residing so

354
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,839
it can be from uh the form tag or href

355
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:44,320
tag

356
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,320
so there's also um some um phishing

357
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,480
content or let's say source code that

358
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,839
hides in the encoded format

359
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,639
it can be from base64 or let's say an

360
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,920
escape format

361
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,680
actually this is very difficult to

362
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,760
detect because uh you need to decode

363
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,000
first the encoded format before it can

364
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,279
be read the volume

365
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,920
it can be readable to human but uh with

366
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,760
the aid of machine learning um i think

367
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,720
we can do something about this one

368
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,959
so to give you more in-depth insight

369
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,880
about the value of machine learning in

370
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,399
this kind of fab threads

371
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,760
i'll turn you over to joy

372
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,040
thank you carla so now that carla gave

373
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,360
you

374
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,920
some of the features we can extract from

375
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,160
the url such as

376
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,360
the web content or url construction

377
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,000
we then feed it to a model so we can use

378
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,760
traditional machine learning methods

379
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,000
such as for supervised learning

380
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,639
you can use a complex model such as lgbm

381
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,519
or lg

382
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,480
or xgboost and combine it with domain

383
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,600
expert features

384
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,920
or we can use a simple model such as

385
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,360
logistic regression

386
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,040
or svm with a low level or sparse

387
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,760
features

388
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,199
and then we can also turn to

389
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,760
unsupervised learning clustering anomaly

390
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,639
detection

391
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,079
as well as deep learning lstm attention

392
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,040
and here i give you a demonstration of

393
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,959
another technology we can use which is

394
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,079
auto ml

395
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,199
the goal of automl is to automate some

396
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:13,839
of the

397
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,800
manual processes for uh machine learning

398
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,519
so

399
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,760
in my experience i have a hard time for

400
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,519
the data preparation and data

401
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,279
pre-processing

402
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,120
so this one at the mlcan

403
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,720
help us and here is some of uh

404
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,000
sample results it can also evaluate

405
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,199
models and give you the leader model

406
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,199
and i use here h2o.ei there are also

407
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,320
other flavors such as azure google cloud

408
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,959
as well as there's automl functionality

409
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,839
and aws

410
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,600
so uh now we move on to well

411
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,279
while the features as humans can

412
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,320
extract there's still blind spots and

413
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,920
this is one area that machine learning

414
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,560
can help

415
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,959
and it's natural language processing

416
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,120
natural language processing is used if

417
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,320
we want to

418
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,880
uh the data being dealt with is text

419
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,639
data and we want to extract

420
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,519
insights from it

421
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,120
so here's a internet meme that

422
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,160
highlights

423
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,759
the impact of miscommunication similarly

424
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,800
uh feeding raw data into the model

425
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,720
text data into the model the model might

426
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,160
not understand it

427
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,720
so we need to convert unstructured data

428
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
to structure data for the model to

429
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,279
understand

430
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,480
an application of nlp will look into

431
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,240
here would be topic modeling

432
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,199
using latin directly allocation so latin

433
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,600
derick let allocation is an unsupervised

434
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,040
machine learning technique

435
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,360
used to find a set of words called

436
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,440
topics in a text document

437
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,600
so if we want to find key information we

438
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,440
can use topic modeling to discover

439
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,240
hidden themes

440
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,199
so there's a set of document we process

441
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,480
it we clean it

442
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,199
there's this lda model uh latent means

443
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,039
hidden directly begins

444
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,240
it's a probability distribution and then

445
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,439
top and then its outputs are topics

446
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,559
and we'll also use gen sim library to go

447
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:22,880
to

448
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,720
the process of finding the best word

449
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,119
distribution for each topic

450
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,559
the case in point here would be covet 19

451
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,120
pandemic malicious urls so the recent

452
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,120
pandemic has been taken advantage

453
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,799
by threat actors so here we source 150

454
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,480
000 malicious url

455
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,840
and our goal is to uncover patterns so

456
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,880
uh because this is challenging because

457
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,559
since there's a pandemic the there are

458
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,080
new sites that are legitimate and uh

459
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,160
also new sites that are uh malicious

460
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,280
and uh in detection of url

461
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,320
we uh one feature we look into is the

462
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,520
age of the url

463
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,280
so first would be to clean the data

464
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,240
here we use tld extract to separate the

465
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,080
subdomain domain and the tld

466
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,559
and and threat actors go to the

467
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,039
exploiting cheap creation of urls

468
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,080
also to evade detection so as you

469
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,760
notice for people who have worked with

470
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,559
malware chat actors use polymorphism

471
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,200
and then for this one for uh website

472
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,720
actors they use uh

473
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,360
yeah something of the sort and then they

474
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,559
just rotate the words

475
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,799
then here in the inside from the top

476
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,160
level domain

477
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,760
uh for the 150 000 url

478
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,160
uh 62 thousands of which have r ustld

479
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,400
and

480
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,640
another way to clean the data yeah

481
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,840
we we can also slice it into

482
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,280
uh its elements characters

483
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,240
and also uh additional filtering would

484
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,440
be tokenization

485
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,559
or separating words

486
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,400
so uh now that we separated it into

487
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,880
tokens

488
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,360
okay there's this uh token to id so you

489
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,160
might

490
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,200
uh you might be confused what's this

491
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,400
uh don't worry because this is the uh

492
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,919
this is the information the

493
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,360
model can understand and

494
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,039
its output would be

495
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,799
this one set of topics

496
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,840
so for the visualization for the

497
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,000
visualization of this experiment

498
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,520
we use pi ldavis so for this subdomain

499
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,080
as you can

500
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,679
see uh there's uh separate clusters

501
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,600
that comprise the words that are near

502
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,280
each other

503
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,080
and then there's uh staging dev news

504
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,960
media

505
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,039
meaning there are scam urls that

506
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,320
leverages uh

507
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,280
news articles you decide to propagate

508
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,159
malicious

509
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,200
uh threats another one would be virus

510
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,400
corona mx

511
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,600
it full then for this one it's

512
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,120
interesting because it has

513
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,360
edu auto uh that gr

514
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,679
so we can see here that in the sub

515
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,640
domain there

516
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,280
are uh letters of domain attract actors

517
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,400
mimics legitimate sites to

518
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,679
uh copy it

519
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,320
and then here another example would be

520
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
from cluster nine or topic nine

521
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,360
so the the

522
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,600
subdomain there is highlighted because

523
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,480
uh in

524
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,080
in the operations it's it presents a

525
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,960
high

526
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,720
uh fa if you detect the domain

527
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,000
is malicious but the sub domain

528
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
but only the sub domain is malicious and

529
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,360
the domain is legitimate

530
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,120
so now we go to the domain

531
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,679
so as you can see here in the domain

532
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,960
blogspot is used

533
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,840
also

534
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,080
and also aws so like what carla

535
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,520
shared to you a while ago sharing

536
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,879
services have been used

537
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,039
and of course map protection tracker is

538
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,960
uh used as cam fish

539
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,760
also azure edge and meal services

540
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,799
so what did we find out so using lda

541
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,720
we found out there's auto generation of

542
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,840
urls

543
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,159
uh websites in the domain as this guys

544
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:48,880
and

545
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,400
there's a prevalent use of sharing

546
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
services possibly to avoid

547
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,520
a security product detection so uh

548
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,559
lda requires a lot of fine-tuning also

549
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,440
and requires a human interpretation for

550
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,000
it

551
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,760
but it's really good for engrams

552
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,400
so for the future of threat landscape

553
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,720
well we can see that more new sharing

554
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,120
services or cloud applications

555
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,559
will be used in phishing attacks as more

556
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,200
people

557
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,640
uh would want to do their job

558
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,039
online

559
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,039
and another one would be leveraging the

560
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,919
mobile banking authentication

561
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,960
efficient scam will average it as

562
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,240
you uh if you have if you went to uh the

563
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,280
talk yesterday

564
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,039
day two uh how to a successful criminal

565
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,360
hoster by vladimir and fyodor

566
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,400
uh they they said there that

567
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,159
there is a use of big data as a service

568
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,440
for tread actors

569
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,840
and the cloud is you will be utilized

570
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,320
for that

571
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,520
i'd like to end this presentation we'd

572
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,280
like to end this presentation

573
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,320
with an artwork from brendan davis

574
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,120
so it's called the art of cyber security

575
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,039
you can see here the frame

576
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,760
we can represent is at as the web and

577
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,000
the black obelisk like objects are the

578
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,679
threats that propagate within the web

579
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,000
and it's as the web is continuously

580
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,799
growing

581
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,520
treasures also threats are also growing

582
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,240
and here you can see the flow

583
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,440
this flow represents the uh various

584
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,600
solutions we

585
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,720
create so machine learning is only part

586
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,159
of the solution

587
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,480
and a multi-layered defense system is

588
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,840
really important

589
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,120
to secure all types of information

590
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,760
from true emails endpoints servers

591
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,279
networks and the clouds

592
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,520
so it's more on really creating the

593
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,200
whole story about it

594
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,559
and uh yeah as

595
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,120
the for the past days we've learned the

596
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,000
importance of big

597
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,799
data and here we presented the

598
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,320
successful or

599
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,760
possible use of machine learning

600
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,400
thank you everyone okay

601
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
thank you for this really interesting

602
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,440
talk um

603
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,279
there's a question from

604
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,240
yes oops sorry

605
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,279
start my video okay

606
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,919
so there is a question from paul

607
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:36,640
christian

608
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,679
here hello carla and joy how do you deal

609
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,520
with phishing urls that have

610
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,679
almost the same content as normal urls

611
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,840
do

612
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,080
so for that actually there are several

613
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,720
algorithms that we can use so in the

614
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,559
machine learning there's uh what they

615
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,320
call the jacquard similarity

616
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,520
so it's called it's more on url

617
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
similarity wherein it uses the bag of

618
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,400
words

619
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,520
so from that we can compare those uh

620
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,440
normal urls to possible phishing urls so

621
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,320
no matter how similar to urls or a lot

622
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
of urls there will always be

623
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,960
something different on them so um one of

624
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,400
the algorithms that

625
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
actually we are currently using that one

626
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,720
which is the jagger similarity or we can

627
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,960
also use the n-grams where in

628
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,159
it based on the count of the characters

629
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,760
per word so yeah something like that

630
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,480
okay thank you then i have a question

631
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,799
and

632
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,400
you mentioned that you use beautiful

633
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,559
soup to uh to parse

634
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,000
kind of the html so what i've seen in

635
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,440
in my experience that some of the html

636
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,360
that's actually sent out and that's

637
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,960
rendered by browsers or

638
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,240
or kind of male clients

639
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,400
is really horrible and doesn't parse at

640
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,240
all in kind of traditional parses like

641
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,840
beautiful soup and stuff like that have

642
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,679
you encountered this and if so how do

643
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,480
you deal with this

644
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,400
we also encountered some actually uh

645
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:16,960
what's

646
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,720
what's uh known for us to be like

647
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,080
gibberish or

648
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,799
not clean source code so actually what

649
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,240
we do with that is uh

650
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,279
we do have some tools for that wherein

651
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,720
we try to auto

652
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,919
also automate and then uh from that from

653
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,080
when uh the source code is already clean

654
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,600
that's when we do the

655
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,799
um beautiful soup library so

656
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,880
uh there's a lot of online tools for

657
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,080
that actually

658
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,720
okay cool thanks a lot i don't think

659
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
there's any more questions so

660
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,279
let me thank you again for this uh

661
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,320
interesting talk

662
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,360
and um i do hope you enjoyed giving it

663
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,559
as much as i enjoyed

664
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,360
listening to it and with that we'll end

665
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,640
this session

666
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,799
uh we're gonna continue in a couple of

667
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,120
minutes with the next talk

668
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,840
see you or hear you then bye bye
