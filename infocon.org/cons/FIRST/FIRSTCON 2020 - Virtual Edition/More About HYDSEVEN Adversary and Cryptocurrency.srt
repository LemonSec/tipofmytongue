00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,199
hello

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,799
my talk is more about hijab adversary

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,240
and cryptocurrency

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,559
first let me introduce myself i'm yushil

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,079
ishkawa from black

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,960
my current job is cyber threat analysis

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,680
and handler

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,720
now let me give you today's agenda at

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,519
four

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,400
first background and next is

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,480
cryptocurrency steering instance

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,599
timeline

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,600
then threat summary associated malware

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,640
and about adversaries followed by

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,239
prevention method

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,520
and finally the conclusion

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,559
at first nowadays cryptocurrency have

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,520
been now being

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,879
actively targeted by cyber attacks

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,600
in such a situation adversaries are

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,199
targeted cryptocurrency

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,239
activity through several methods in

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,359
example

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,640
illegal mining that use is computer

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,600
resources

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,640
or stealing from crypto wallet

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,560
from victim or direct stealing from

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,600
cryptocurrency exchange entities

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,880
hide 7 is a cyber criminal group that is

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,840
actively still a large amount of those

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,759
asset with the sophisticated method

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,799
in this presentation we would like to

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,000
introduce the ttp used by hyde7

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
instilling crypto asset to prevent

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,840
similar attacks

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,680
in the future

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,720
first topic is cryptocurrency stealing

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,000
instance timeline

39
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,399
about height 7 activity timeline from

40
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,960
2016 to 2017

41
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,680
we have confirmed that there were many

42
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,880
instant calls by

43
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,079
the had 7 adversary happened in 2016 and

44
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,600
2017

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,560
looking at the series of attack in 2016

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,720
activities

47
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,440
there was spear fishing male that is

48
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,000
much

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,440
of its macro by the way

50
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,800
in 2017 we can see that

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,920
spear-facing male exploiting microsoft

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,760
ox vulnerability was used

53
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,920
from 2018 to 2020

54
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,239
although we could not confirm in 2018

55
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,720
there was no activity was performed by

56
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,239
hudson

57
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,680
the adversary activity has been detected

58
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,239
again in 2019 in 2019

59
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,720
we can see that wind land use rivalry

60
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,599
vulnerability

61
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,560
and the firefox 0d vulnerability is for

62
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,840
attack

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,840
in 2020 we don't see any height of 7th

64
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,959
activity yet in addition

65
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,319
the adversary is not only utilizing

66
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,519
exploitation of vulnerabilities and of

67
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,959
macro execution but we have confirmed

68
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:15,840
that

69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,200
they also use attack method by using

70
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,760
restomate software faith installers

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,120
hyde7 is known for using a high scale

72
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,040
dynamic and diverse method of attacks

73
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,920
and their malware is always designed to

74
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,159
aim multiple operating systems

75
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,200
next topic is threat summary

76
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,400
seven steals cryptocurrency with three

77
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,920
attacking methods

78
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,959
such as microsoft macros

79
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,720
exploitation some software

80
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,400
vulnerabilities and

81
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,519
fake installers

82
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,439
first infection chain for obsmacular

83
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,319
the exploitation using office macros

84
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,360
were confirmed

85
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,840
as incidents in august and december

86
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,959
2016.

87
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,600
this left images indicate the infection

88
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,519
flow

89
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,400
the office macular contain interesting

90
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,720
and

91
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,120
specific code that is having the

92
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
password generation code

93
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,759
published in the programming forum

94
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
now let's see the oxymoron case in

95
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,639
december 2016.

96
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,360
adversary was stealing account from a

97
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,000
specific

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,040
university this proved

99
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,199
london school member to send

100
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,360
spearfishing mail to target

101
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,040
victim and mail container link

102
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,080
and that link is connected to url

103
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,400
from the same compromise university

104
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,840
website

105
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,080
to download the microsoft word file

106
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,120
contains

107
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,400
merchant smart guru

108
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,600
if macro is enabled the master's partial

109
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,479
script will be executed

110
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,039
to download file from merger server

111
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,479
provided by the adversary

112
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,960
the downloaded file is a maria called

113
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,199
smoke or e-commerce or

114
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,960
mox for windows you see e-commerce

115
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,600
string

116
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,320
and c2 address in the downloaded file

117
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,440
this is another optional macro pattern

118
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,080
also

119
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,120
similar one files including office macro

120
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,240
is used

121
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,280
and mysql file is

122
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,840
downloaded from the same microserver as

123
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,320
before

124
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,520
this downloaded file network for windows

125
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,960
you can see that smoke and network were

126
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,759
placed with

127
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,280
similar file names to the same

128
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,840
merchant server

129
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,080
the next topic is infection chain for

130
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,479
exploitation software's vulnerabilities

131
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,759
attacks using exploitation from software

132
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,840
vulnerabilities were confirmed on

133
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,479
instant in february 2017

134
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,319
september 2017 march 2019

135
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,680
and june 2019

136
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,800
in these cases hide seven used microsoft

137
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,319
office vulnerabilities with

138
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,400
largest library vulnerability and

139
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,719
fireworks parameters for attacks

140
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,720
now let's see the microsoft office

141
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,720
vulnerabilities case in february 2017

142
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,919
adversary uses spear fishing male as

143
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,520
rf members like a previous case

144
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,319
a male contains a world file including

145
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,240
malicious eps object

146
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,120
having export cbe 2015-545 and

147
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,360
cbe 2016-7255

148
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,479
if our effective victim open this file

149
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,199
you will be infected by network in the

150
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,759
background

151
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,479
the eps object included in this world

152
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,960
file contains cbe 2015-545

153
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,639
exploit code it reveals the privilege

154
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,440
escalation exploit depends on the

155
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,840
victim's architecture

156
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:45,120
and executes embedded network

157
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,759
this is the other exploit barnaby prata

158
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,400
in june 2019 case

159
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,879
adversary uses spear fishing male as

160
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,960
cambridge members

161
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,800
if a victim of male and click the url by

162
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,560
firefox

163
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,919
cbe 2019-11707 and cbe 2019-11708

164
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,840
exploit world delivered from martial

165
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,639
sites

166
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,199
it executes share code and download

167
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,319
passage maria

168
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,759
so this malicious domain looks like

169
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,039
google's analytics

170
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,720
in this case net wire and smoke for mac

171
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,799
os will be downloaded and

172
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,559
executed netwire is faster

173
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,159
maria and then smoke is downloaded from

174
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,839
network

175
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,839
these binaries are not signed

176
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,320
there is another case about infection

177
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,920
chain by utilizing

178
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,760
fake installer this fake installer

179
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,399
method

180
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,320
has been sent to victim using

181
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,640
spear-facing mails on instant

182
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,240
we confirmed in november 2016

183
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,839
october 2017 and february 2019.

184
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,160
in these cases and we're meeting

185
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,040
software from

186
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,440
bus conferences and status question

187
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,440
software from start scope has been

188
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,240
abused

189
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,560
now let's see the fake installer case in

190
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,279
november 2016.

191
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,160
spearfishing mail contains three type of

192
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,200
urls

193
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,959
for windows mac os or linux

194
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,959
that allows you to download fake

195
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,320
installers from

196
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,320
a compromised university website

197
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,800
if a victim downloaded file from this

198
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,000
url

199
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,920
and execute it fake installer install

200
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,560
estimate

201
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,959
statistical software and in the

202
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,320
background

203
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,720
might just fix the downloader will be

204
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,360
saved

205
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,519
and executed by installer script

206
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,640
upon success installation the downloader

207
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,040
runs race meter startup program and

208
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,599
downloads malware from manager site

209
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,480
the upper image is downloaded function

210
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:16,800
of

211
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,959
fake stata the downloader will download

212
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,000
and run network for multiple platform in

213
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,680
this analysis

214
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,880
we focus into windows service

215
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,640
the bureau image is fixed the download

216
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,079
that detected

217
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,839
in february 2019. we can see that

218
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,079
the seated domain and processor similar

219
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,720
in both fixed downloaded cases

220
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,959
for the virtual machine or premium

221
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,360
detection in fixed data downloaders

222
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,959
we found there is almost no difference

223
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:03,040
between binary in 2016 and 2019

224
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,360
next topic is associated malware

225
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,480
hyo7 uses netwire and smoke as

226
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,079
main maria toolkit in their first

227
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:23,040
cryptocurrency steering attack chains

228
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,640
the first topic is network

229
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,760
netwire is remote administration tool

230
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,399
developed

231
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,440
by worldwide other love that support

232
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,200
multiple platforms such as windows linux

233
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,959
and macos etc

234
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,760
the capability of network includes key

235
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,480
logging

236
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,240
screen capture reversure and web browser

237
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,160
and mirror password shift

238
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,399
this image is for making a executable

239
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,320
for mac os with network

240
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,680
builder 1.6

241
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,560
barrier setting can be set as network

242
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,480
installation options

243
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,279
let's look at the sum setting at first

244
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,000
copy server is make a self copy in the

245
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,760
specific path

246
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,959
merge server is to delete themselves key

247
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,160
logger is for key logging function

248
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,440
and logging item and clone startup

249
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,079
are for persistence functions

250
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,279
handset network has several features

251
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,320
that are not

252
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,240
included in the auxiliary version

253
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,480
the comparison table of high sample

254
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,279
network

255
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,000
and offshore version of network is shown

256
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,160
in the table

257
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,920
hide same network has some differences

258
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,839
the next slide explains

259
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,639
this function's detail in hindsight

260
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,279
network

261
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,959
first the specific rc4 key

262
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,680
high cell network has a common rc4

263
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,440
encryption key

264
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,639
print see that's right this encryption

265
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,320
key is used to decrypt

266
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,600
file name variable name or windows api

267
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,560
name

268
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,360
in this slide a search file operation

269
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,480
api name and

270
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,399
run string is encrypted

271
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,560
second network versions

272
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,680
alpha image is actual version and

273
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,040
lower images have seven versions

274
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,240
network version information is has coded

275
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,959
within its binary file

276
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,560
hyo7 version is version 1.0

277
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,920
in hex value with 100100

278
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,360
offshore network has been updated in

279
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,639
regular basis

280
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,000
and the latest version is version 2.1

281
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
r5 in every 2020.

282
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,079
as you can see in the below three

283
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,120
pictures the hydro7 has used same

284
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,839
version of network until now

285
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,920
about the pocket function the winged

286
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,320
version of high sample network has a

287
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
hard-coded open source to

288
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,440
call pocket it's a partial script

289
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,760
the malware will check the process of

290
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,279
norton security software by searching

291
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,079
ns.exe string from the process list

292
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,880
if this process detected handsome

293
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,519
network will make a tcp hoarding

294
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,519
connection to the c2 server

295
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,720
using the perkit instead of direct

296
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,079
connecting the t2

297
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,680
so why does it only detect not on

298
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,719
security process

299
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,040
the next is console code page setting

300
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,920
high cell network executes shell command

301
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,440
using character encoding with utf8

302
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,079
it seems that adversary doesn't want to

303
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,480
use a default character code on the

304
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,720
victim computer

305
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,240
iptf function hidesafe network has a

306
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,040
function to get a global ip address in

307
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,079
one of the bot

308
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,440
instructions this

309
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,759
instruction connects to check

310
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:43,279
ipdynamics.org.org

311
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,360
this function is not available on the

312
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,199
offshore version of network

313
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,839
this is the c2 communication of hydro7th

314
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,600
network

315
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
the traffic is different compared to the

316
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,360
optional version runs

317
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,680
we compare the initial communication

318
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,399
packet sent from the client to the c2

319
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,360
server

320
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,800
please leave this right hand same

321
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,759
network has

322
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,040
xor encrypt and decrypt function against

323
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,120
the instruction command

324
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,480
the encryption key in hex is 7c and the

325
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,360
decryption key in hex is zero

326
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,360
fffffffffffp3

327
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,000
the next topic is smoke maria smoke is a

328
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,120
lot developed

329
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,360
on cutie most of the smoke was complex

330
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,480
with upx it was firstly discovered in

331
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,759
january 2016.

332
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,480
this mario is able to steal various type

333
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,519
of data from the victim machine

334
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,839
it's called as e-commerce from

335
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,279
hard-coded project

336
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,119
this image is a lot functions of smoke

337
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,400
screen captures are taken in every 30

338
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,359
seconds

339
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,000
and smoke a lot more researches for the

340
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,839
office document file in victims machine

341
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,959
smoke rat marvel left some references

342
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,760
that corresponded to advantage original

343
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,520
source file

344
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,640
this source file has rsa public key data

345
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,080
in the binaries resource data section

346
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,799
we have confirmed that this key is

347
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,600
encrypted

348
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,960
in some samples and this key is used to

349
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,440
obtain the aes session key in the c2

350
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,240
communication

351
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,400
exchange the resource name has

board

354
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,720
smoke lot marker for windows operating

355
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
system has a function to

356
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,760
check for ns.exe and

357
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,039
podcast string as well as the height

358
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,559
7th network does

359
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,600
for pocket the partial script is not

360
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,000
hard

361
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,799
coded only the function to call it

362
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,600
implemented

363
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,559
this similarity is very significant for

364
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,640
us to conclude

365
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,440
smoke is a unique malware used by the

366
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,039
same adversary as

367
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,559
height 7th network

368
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,000
next rest our attention to the c2

369
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,559
infrastructure of highseb

370
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,039
heil 7 is preferred to use a specific

371
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:49,760

hosting company or vh23 media

373
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,080
over reef web this trend is continuing

374
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,559
and even in the fireworks partnership

375
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,120
case in 2019

376
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,000
the c2 server is an ip address managed

377
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,520
by 23 media

378
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,840
and reset

379
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,559
is hide seventh attack ongoing vmware

380
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,360
carbon black thread a nice unique check

381
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,480
for working has saved network c2

382
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,640
using the pog scania during mid november

383
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,840
2019

384
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,000
but there was no responsibility to

385
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,679
detect it

386
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,559
the possible reason for this result are

387
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,600
first

388
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,640
handsaver advisory was not active during

389
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,760
the scanning time

390
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,799
using their customized network

391
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,320
second adversary maybe start to use

392
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,840
new customers network or new rat tool

393
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,480
third feet can only be accessed from the

394
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,559
ip address or from the

395
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,559
targeted network thank mr takahiro

396
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:07,520
hariyama for his great report and too

397
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,520
the next topic is about every

398
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,440
there are two footprints that are

399
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,280
included in the decoy

400
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,720
document file and code signing

401
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,000
certificate raised by

402
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,679
hide seven adversaries this footprint

403
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,080
is not one hundred percent concluding

404
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,240
origin of the adversaries

405
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,159
since they are possible faking their

406
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,200
trade so much too

407
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,000
first above the decoy document file

408
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,679
these

409
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,320
above are two decode files using the

410
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,720
high

411
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,919
seven attack in 2016.

412
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,400
you can see that language setting in the

413
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,880
document file is russian ms word

414
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,159
environment

415
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,880
also we check office document file

416
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,600
properties

417
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,559
company name value contains the word

418
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,080
grid377

419
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,960
string is included the pirates of the

420
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,600
product

421
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,199
used by part actors

422
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,960
second about code signing certificate

423
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,679
halsey adversary uses code signing

424
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,840
certificate for windows malware

425
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,200
used in its activities

426
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,600
this image of certificate was using

427
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,400
attack between august 2016

428
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,240
and september 2017 we investigated

429
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,760
this certificate in the certification

430
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,400
detail

431
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,000
you can see that russian related

432
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,840
naming is used as a registration company

433
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,320

434
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,720
address and command name please see the

435
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,120
picture

436
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,320
the sophistication of adversary is high

437
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,039
hand seven adverts use variety

438
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,080
sophisticated

439
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,559
techniques there are some sophistication

440
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,640
that can be described in mita attack but

441
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,200
some of them are difficult to define in

442
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,640
mita attack specifications

443
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,799
please see this table for decal

444
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,679
this is the miter attack matrix for

445
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,840
height 7 thread

446
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,678
the next part in this life

447
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,640
about prevention and detection

448
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,960
in prevention there are some methods we

449
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,760
can use

450
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,200
first plenty of insulin attack vectors

451
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,840
are from

452
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,039
spear-facing males keep up to date with

453
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,320
the related system

454
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,760
software and use security products

455
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,240
educate employing potential security

456
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,240
threat and easily

457
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,640
do not opening an email do not click url

458
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,440
share such subscribe information within

459
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,280
the organization using sysad

460
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,360
second check the code signing of

461
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,799
application using

462
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,440
sig check or code signing command etc

463
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,520
third partial hta vbs are often used in

464
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,640
the series over similar threats

465
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,000
check the partial hda vbs execution by

466
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,760
the edr product

467
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,039
broke the partial hda and vbs with

468
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,600
approach and software restriction policy

469
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,158
etc

470
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,960
about the detection first see to traffic

471
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,000
detection sri cataracts snot can use a

472
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
forming role to detect the

473
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,240
hazard network and seat traffic

474
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,159
second signature detection to scan this

475
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,039
mario

476
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,720
we can use a the yard detail will be

477
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,400
introduced in the next one

478
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,760
here is a sample yellow to detect high

479
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,039
sample network

480
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,840
and smoke

481
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,120
finally in conclusion high seven

482
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,480
adversaries uses

483
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,520
variety sophisticated techniques and

484
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,320
global social engineering tactics for

485
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,760
steering crypto assets

486
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,559
have seven initial access are mostly by

487
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,760
spearfishing

488
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,640
from compromised mail pretending to be

489
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,880
university contacts

490
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,440
in many cases compromised university

491
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,000
websites are also utilized to deliver

492
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,480
payroll

493
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,840
high safe network and smoke rotten area

494
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,720
can infect

495
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,960
multiple endpoint platform as their

496
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,600
first infection chain

497
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,679
through the rat information correcting

498
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,000
session and credential

499
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,799
the endgame of this attack is gaining

500
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,640
access to the crypto asset

501
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,559
infrastructure

502
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,200
they are using any possible method to

503
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,919
gain those access

504
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,720
the best way to prevent this adversary

505
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,279
is to

506
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,799
detect and respond its attack

507
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,520
in a kill chain process as early as

508
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,600
possible

509
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,320
