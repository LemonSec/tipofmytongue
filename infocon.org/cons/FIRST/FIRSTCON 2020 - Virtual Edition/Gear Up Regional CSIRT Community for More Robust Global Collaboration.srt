for most of the time i have been

68
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,000

pacific region as you can see

73
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,280
and while first as needless to say plays

74
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,120
a prominent role in the sister

75
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,360
collaboration in the global level

76
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,879
there are many regional caesar

77
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,360
communities as well in the in the world

78
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,640
as they need to collaborate in a closer

79
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,000
proximity so um

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,800
the purpose of this panel uh here is to

81
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,920
um

82
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,840
in the next 30 minutes i would like to

83
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,440
put a focus on these regional

84
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,319
uh scissors uh activities and invite our

85
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,319

86
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,239
in the regional communities

87
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,080
in order to deepen our understanding in

88
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,920
the first communities about regional

89
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,560
efforts

90
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,120
to um that exists in the different parts

91
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,879
of the world and especially from the

92
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,680
aspect to

93
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,680
enhance the incident handling capability

94
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,280
in the regional level

95
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,480
so um with that i'd like to ask some

96
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,239
questions to a panelist

97
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,599
and see how they actually

98
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,920
how each original sister community

99
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,879
actually work and

100
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,000

started

141
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,160
few years ago mostly since 2010 and

142
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,280

sectors with structure and unstructured

147
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,400
teams the network

148
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,759
operates on three pillars operation

149

research and policy making

150
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,360
and there are a couple of principles

151
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,440
that guide the operation

152
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
at least a point of contact in the

153
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,240

the original level

162
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,639
will eventually contribute to the

163
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,240
overall improvement

164
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,400

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,240
shared techno technical knowledge

177
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,520
non-pattern

178
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,800
that scale and best practice this expert

179
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,479
contribute to

180
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,280
regional collaboration as well as

181
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,319
international

182
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,000
collaboration in the african context

183
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,199
regional collaboration is evident as

184
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,400
and we even expect more regional

185
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,680
initiative the india's african union's

186
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,880
resident initiative

187
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
include the malabar convention and a

188
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,199
digital transformation framework

189
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,440
with team for the continent economic

190
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,880
prosperity

191
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,680
the regional economic communities play a

192
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,240
role

193
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,199
in economic integration addressing

194
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,639
regional challenge

195
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,599
promoting peace and security working

196
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,199
with various stakeholders

197
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,599
in raising the standard of living

198
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,960
contributing to the

199
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,759
continuous progress and development

200
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,160
through

201
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,919
economic growth and social development

202
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,240
internet security become therefore a

203
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,080
regional concern

204
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,360
with wide-ranging trend social

205
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,120
political and economic implications

206
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,759
responders and defenders are affected by

207
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,520
these implications

208
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,479
they are also affected by cultural norms

209
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,400
and identities

210
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,759
a regional framework like african cert

211
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,960
provide a network that supports that

212
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,880
regional agenda

213
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,400
and specifies specifically tackling

214
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,120
regional

215
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,160
challenge and leveraging opportunities

216
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,440
so some of the key things that happen

217
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,479
within the africa set network

218
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,319
is to ensuring reachability now as i

219
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,280
mentioned before

220
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,319
at least a point of contact in countries

221
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,599
liaison between regional

222
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,240
national and external bodies

223
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,319
facilitation of capacity building

224
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,599
through conferences

225
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,759
training events and coordinated

226
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,120
exercises

227
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,440
sharing technical knowledge national

228
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,680
level expertise and exchanging

229
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,960
information forging regional

230
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,599
expert culture and carrying out

231
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,240
community

232
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,599
building activities supporting regional

233
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,080
framework and networking country so you

234
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,159
often see teams between countries

235
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,279
helping each other a joint exercise and

236
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,159
establishing

237
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,120
of lesson learned joint capacity

238
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,399
building events

239
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,440
study tool travel and even incubation of

240
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,519
personal inside teams you often see

241
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,560
a team sending his personal to another

242
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,120
team

243
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,480
for incubation period and i would

244
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,360
like to set few examples that even

245
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,920
happened

246
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,440
within this this month one

247
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,399
is in terms of team establishment so the

248
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,360
scenario

249
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,399
usually is as this a country

250
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,600
is at the planning stage of his national

251
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,440
team or even an organization

252
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,399
at the planning stage of his team he

253
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,120
engaged

254
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,640
the africa secretary various team reach

255
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,680
out to them

256
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,600
share their experience they process the

257
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,720
challenge

258
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,880
and through that framework a

259
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,760
collaboration

260
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,080
framework started to help this team

261
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,430
to start build on

262
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,839
[Music]

263
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,519
the existing and reach a certain level

264
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,040
of maturity

265
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,279
a second experience is for example

266
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,320
access to first and first fellowship

267
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,839
usually what you start seeing now

268
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,880
since we started

269
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,839
this regional network is teams

270
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,760
conducting assessment for first

271
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,800
membership

272
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,200
and supporting one one one another for

273
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,839
membership

274
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,640
application you also see teams

275
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,360
supporting

276
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,040
one another for first fellowship

277
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,320
um a third example that i would like to

278
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,200
outline is in terms of incident

279
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
coordination

280
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,680
a typical scenario is a team is

281
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,600
coordinating an incident

282
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,880
team share information ioc

283
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,480
etc with other teams luckily a team has

284
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,279
already experienced this

285
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,800
and get into supporting

286
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,640
the team that is real that is

287
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,399
experiencing the current

288
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,120
issue there are some incidents for

289
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,640
example that are common

290
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,800
in an african region and at the end

291
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
they share the lesson learned for the

292
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,399
global community

293
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,839
so i will i would like to stop um

294
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,440
at that point and give the opportunity

295
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,839
of to my tier collect more

296
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,320
to share with us the experience in oic

297
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,040
search so

298
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,959

cert so you mentioned about the very

302
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
important points such as um

303
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,240
point of contact and reachability that's

304
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,120
one of the

305
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,000
um good example of uh regional um

from my site okay from the oic set uh

318
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,360
spec see the oic uh itself

319
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,880
consists of 57 56 countries

320
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,360
okay spread out throughout at least

321
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,399
three regions

322
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,440

we have uh the membership which is

330
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,920
broken up into at least three major ones

331
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
which is the full member

332

00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,240
it is open to

343
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,279
any organization that is interested

oic cert

346
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,760
vision in terms of making the cyber save

347
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,279
as the cyber's

348
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,720
space safe so

349
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,079
in terms of uh

350
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,639
why okay the benefits of certs

351
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,600
systems having to work with each other

352
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,639
is that

353
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,839
cyber we acknowledge okay the oic cert

354
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,720
acknowledged that cyber security or the

355
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,440
cyber

356
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,800
environment does not

357
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,519
it's not a localized thing so it is an

358
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,120
international method it's a global

359
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,920
matter

360
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,120
so a local season would be at a

361
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,800
disadvantage

362
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,760
that is the reason why c cert needs to

363
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,600
be

364
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,560
on on an international platform on a

365
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,160
collaboration international platform to

366
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,360
work together

367
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,000
leveraging the global uh this

368
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,880
collaboration

369
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,160
in terms of mitigating cyber threats

370
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,279
so for that okay the oic set okay

371
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,560
believes that

372
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,440
uh have uh in strengthening and the

373
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,360
relationship among the members

374
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,519
right now we have 20 27

375
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,000
oic countries as members okay and then

376
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,519
with this membership we we intend to

377
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,639
strengthen

378
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,480
the capabilities of the members at least

379
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,279
to have

380
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,560
some minimum level of cyber security

381
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,360
and then we encourage also the the uh

382
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,279
sharing of information

383
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,360
and experience among members okay

384
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,120
building the capabilities in terms of

385
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,360
providing training and awareness

386
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,760
and then promoting collaborative

387
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,560
research

388
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,360
okay such as the malware research that

389
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,279
we have right now

390
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,680
we do work together with all the members

391
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,199
in terms of collecting data

392
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,480
and so on and uh

393
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,760
we try to reach out to the rest of the

394
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,680
member teams okay we still have another

395
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,279
25 countries

396
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,560
that is not being a member yet okay

397
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,399
we are trying to reach out to them

398
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,160
however they probably have other

399
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,279
priorities

400
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,480
in term and information management

401
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,800
probably is not their priority right now

402
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,519
and then uh the most important thing is

403
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,560
that

404
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,680
we assist we try to assist

405
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,800
um you know the not

406
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,240
so advanced member to bring up their

407
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,920
capability

408
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,160
in terms of cyber security so that they

409
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,920
will be able to mitigate

410
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,000
and manage any cyber incidents

411
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,560
properly

412
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,240
so basically that is more or less on

413
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,720
what uh icci does actually

414
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,839
all right um thank you very much to me

415
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,639
for um

416
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,639
explaining about your activities and

417
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,480
basics about the oic

418
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,120
search so i believe oic search is one of

419
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,240
the quite unique

420
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,240
um community because it is not only

421
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,120
bonded by the regional uh background but

422
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,880
it's also based on the religious

423
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,639
community that you have

424
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,920
um quite it covers quite you know wide

425
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,800
geographical area as you mentioned from

426
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,079
the asia to

427
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,880
middle east to africa so that's a great

428
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,680
point and

429
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,440
also you also mentioned about the

430
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
outreach to the remaining

431
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,959
um oic countries um in order to um

432
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,880
you know welcome them on board to the

433
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,800
oic cert community and that's one thing

434
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
that that is really important about

435
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,199
um you know making the community you

436
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,880
know to a richer

437
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,920
environment so um with that

438
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,759
i would like to move on to the next

439
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,440
question that i have here

440
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,680
so the another question that i have here

441
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,000
is the the challenges and obstacles

442
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,480
um when you when you're working in a

443
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,359
regional

444
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,720
community so um i would like to ask

445
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
two of you uh what are the challenges

446
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,319
and obstacles hindering smooth

447
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,280
collaboration

448
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,599
among members in the region and how does

449
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,280
your community aim to address such

450
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,799
issues this may include

451
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,199
for example the language barriers or

452
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,799
maybe some different cultures that

453
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,160
you're facing or

454
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,319
you can also mention something about the

455
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,919
the situation that you're facing

456
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,200
in relation to the covet 19 situation so

457
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,679
with that um again i'd like to pass it

458
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,640
over to uh

459
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,480
general bell if you could start with

460
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,400
your uh intervention about the africa

461
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,760
sir please

462
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,280
yeah um thank you so i will mention

463
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,440
couple of points uh

464
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,320
about four points um so the language

465
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,600
barrier

466
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,640
um there are a couple of

467
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,000
languages within the continent

468
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,760
mostly french english etc

469
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,200
portuguese and what you see

470
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,200
today to overcome that

471
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,400
language barrier is some teams

472
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,440
taking to task to translate

473
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,440
key documents putting those documents

474
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,640
at the disposal of the the community so

475
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,840
for example

476
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,520
they just some of the team just

477
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,039
completed

478
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,240
the translation of sim tray

479
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,760
they have also completed the

480
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,919
transmission the the translation

481
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,880
of um

482
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,039
seaside creation and management

483
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,320
documentation that they have shared to

484
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,240
to with other teams that that are having

485
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,200
some language challenge um another

486
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,320
challenge that

487
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,679
i would like to talk about is building

488
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,039
trust

489
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,799
as you know coordinating a

490
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:00,000
multi-stakeholder network

491
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,400
with entities from various countries

492
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,120
and sectors in a context where

493
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,760
government

494
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,080
and public sector are learning to work

495
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,360
together

496
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,400
is very challenging it

497
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,840
implies setting clear expectations on

498
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,480
how

499
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,960
information has to be exchanged will be

500
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,840
used

501
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,440
disseminated

502
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,160
establishment of a secure infrastructure

503
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,280
for managing

504
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,160
sensitive information the ability to

505
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,840
communicate securely

506
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,280
with different stakeholders having

507
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,880
a common understanding of things

508
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,160
uh an infrastructure that supports

509
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,720
advanced notification for selected

510
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,840
audience

511
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,799
a procedure to guard error against

512
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,880
information leakage

513
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,160
the ability to to reach out to teams

514
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,280
in unexpected expected

515
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,720
timeline and understanding of the same

516
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,760
fundamental principle

517
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,960
we are still working on this

518
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,880
it is a work in progress however

519
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,799
we see some improvements by organizing

520
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,760
yearly events gathering all the

521
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,799
stakeholders

522
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,000
uh in the multi-stakeholder dialogue

523
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,720
the recent symposium uh for example that

524
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,679
we had from

525
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,280
21st to 23 october

526
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,880
is an activity uh that is expected to

527
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,159
to happen at least

528
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,679
every year hosted by a sister teams

529
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,240
participating in various community

530
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,840
activities for example

531
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,880
the african internet summit is

532
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,840
hosted by the technical community is

533
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,400
also

534
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,760
a way that help us to breach gap and to

535
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,559
allow

536
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,480
the different community to understand

537
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,799
each other and also to communicate

538
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,080
and there is also a significant work

539
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,280
to provide access to knowledge standard

540
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,679
developed in the first community and

541
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,799
also in different

542
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,559
trusted community but also

543
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,679
what started this year is the

544
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,400
participating and organizing cyber

545
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,200
exercise

546
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,520
at the continental level so that people

547
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,240
can

548
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,120
have the ability to speak to each other

549
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
and work together

550
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,760
another challenge is the political

551
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,120
commitment

552
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,159
how do you strengthen and extend

553
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,120
such a network

554
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,400
without political commitment or

555
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,200
what you do to secure political

556
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,240
commitment and

557
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,520
member state support to ensure

558
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,320
that they they support the regional c-3

559
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,039
coverage

560
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,280
and provide the organization with the

561
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,440
institutional framework

562
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,400
that is necessary to to proceed

563
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,880
and we are still working reaching out to

564
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,880
the african union regional economic

565
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,760
forum

566
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,320
but also participating in activities

567
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,880
like

568
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,240
igf and others to engage

569
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,080
policy makers but also um

570
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,520
members sit at the political level

571
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,039
to secure their support for

572
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,840
for the net worth and a fourth thing

573
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,240
that i would like to talk about

574
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,760
is resources um organizing these

575
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,799
activities are not inexpensive

576
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,320
and you especially when you have teams

577
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,360
at various level of their maturity

578
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,960
curve how do you

579
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,640
support the operation of such a network

580
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,720
uh without having a single

581
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,919
entity or member take over all the

582
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,000
challenges

583
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,640
sometimes support is required to sustain

584
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,760
operation

585
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,520
to to to organize activities or even to

586
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,400
secure

587
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,840
members participation and travel

588
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,440
if i had been made at that level to

589
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,120
engage various actors

590
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,880
both within the african network but

591
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,559
also the international community

592
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,000
but also teams uh

593
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,120
provide some function as services for

594
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,000
example

595
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,200
uh at this time a team is hosting the

596
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,320
secretary

597
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,080
for uh several years

598
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,480
another team is performing other

599
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,120
functions

600
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,480
as the incident the system response

601
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,520
uh for last resort seaside activities

602
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,880
another team is providing support

603
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,799
for translating various documents

604
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,640
into different language having said that

605
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,559
i will stop there and i will give the

606

um thank you very much i think that

610
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,279

611
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,440
useful um activities that that we're

612
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,320

um facing um in oic cert um

622
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,400
because we're kind of running out of

623
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,960
time um maybe quickly if you could

624
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,320

625
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,440
um please check me okay no

626
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,960
would i would um support uh what

627
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,279
john roberts said just now you know uh

628
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,200
most of the challenges that he is facing

629
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,400
is the same with

630
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,600
uh with what we are facing in oasis but

631
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,400
i would like to

632
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,559
just sum up the challenges that we face

633
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,240
into just two

634
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,559
main categories which is establishing

635
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,360
trust

636
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,000
okay and then establishing the

637
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,039
commitments

638
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,159
from the members okay so uh for trust

639
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,840
for example right

640
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,600
we need to have trust uh because we are

641
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,840
at the end of the day we are still human

642
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,880
so

643
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,159
how do we establish this okay so

644
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,760
so although we we do uh speak over the

645
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,600
the phone via email about being human

646
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,400
there is this necessity for us to meet

647
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,640
eye to eye

648
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,200
to to look into the eyes and and talk

649
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,760
about

650
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,880
matters so that is why uh for osc said

651
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,520
we do

652
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,120
uh place uh heavy

653
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,600
uh requirement in terms of meeting face

654
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,240
to face

655
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,120
at least uh once a year you know during

656
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,400
our annual conference

657
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,960
that is where we establish repo with

658
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,760
each other

659
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,960
we do team building to so that we know

660
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,600
the other members not just as colleagues

661
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,039
but as friends

662
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,080
from there it will instill trust okay

663
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,279
uh between us it took to share

664
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,799
uh information and maybe

665
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,240
sensitive information in terms of

666
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,840
mitigating the

667
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,720
cyber threats yeah the other thing also

668
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,520
we need to

669
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,039
although okay although we agree

670
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,679
uh in principle that we will not allow

671
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,520
our political beliefs

672
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,799
to interfere in in the collaboration

673
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,520
but it does you know the government does

674
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,400
have at the end

675
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,679
a say on what we transmit uh what we

676
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,240
share

677
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,960
okay and then that is about trust then

678
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,279
the other one is about having commitment

679
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,640
now oic said is a voluntary

680
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,240
effort okay people uh join

681
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,520
uh the the the bandwagon okay

682
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,200
because they want to the benefits of it

683
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,720
so oh icci okay have been

684
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,840
established since 2008 2009

685
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,520
okay and after after more than 10 years

686
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,559
we only get about half of the map

687
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,960
the you know oic member countries to be

688
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,000
on board

689
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,039
so you can see the commitment that that

690
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,919
that is being shown okay uh this is

691
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,120
probably because

692
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,320
not all the oic countries are

693
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,279
putting priority in in their information

694
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,000

cut in your um intervention but uh we're

710
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,399
kind of running out of time so

711
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,799
um before um just the last message from

712
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:25,760
myself

713
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,039
um is that uh um as you can see we have

714
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,240
a lot of different uh

715
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,080
regional level um activities to raise up

716
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,559
cyber security capability and that kind

717
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,760
of activity will

718
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,039
eventually um be connected to the um

719
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,679
cyber security economy activity as a

720
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,240
whole

721

so um

723
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,840
i'd like to one of the takeaways that i

724
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,600
have here is that we have these

725
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,840
regional communities and they're doing

726
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,600
different jobs to um

727
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,799
elaborate um and raise up um

728
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,080
global communities efforts in there and

729
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,240
so audrey we have some questions here

730

yes we do so if you can if you guys can

731
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,120

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,880
uh we have about one minute left um

733
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,799
maybe one one each of you can maybe

734
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,320
address one one

735
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,399
uh one question each and then uh we'll

736
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,120
go we'll take it from there

737
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,799
okay can i can i answer the uh the one

738
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,200
that

739
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,399
says about uh to what extent do oic

740
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,559
certain african capacity building

741
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,760
activity coordination

742
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,799
and sharing as a key role okay

743
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,159
so uh for this one um we

744
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,200
do have a group okay

745
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,840
being led by one of the steering

746
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,520
committee members so to speak

747
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,440
to to do capacity building

748
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,720
it is a major activity for us

749
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,840
okay and we do this training at

750
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,960
at least okay once a month we do have

751
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,720
uh i would say online training

752
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,520
and as i mentioned for us to get more

753
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,200
members to come on board

754
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,240
we need to have awareness sessions with

755
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,799
them

756
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,120
so capacity building and awareness

757
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,159
sessions are

758
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,559
a key role as far as the oic cert is

759
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,960
concerned

760
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,880
