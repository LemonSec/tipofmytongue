at now is bridging the gap on s-bomb

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,000
collaborating for software component

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,440
transparency

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,840
um just one item before we get started

so

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,680
you will see a q and a icon or box on

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,239
your screen

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,360
and we ask that you submit your

all be muted

30
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,000
um questions will be queued up in the

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
order received and we will address them

32
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,640
um at the end in the human day and with

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,280
that let's go ahead and get started

34
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,200
so i'd like to introduce our speakers

35
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,320
today so we have dr alan friedman

multi-stakeholder processes on cyber

42
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,520
security convening

43
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,119
cross-sector working groups with a focus

44
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,720
on resilience in a vulnerable ecosystem

45
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,400
we have another speaker who is from

46
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,040
japan mr tomo ito

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,960
so tomo ito has been working as a

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,880
vulnerability information coordinator at

49
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,520
jb

50
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,159

51
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:42,960
focuses

52
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
include international collaborations

53
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,479
regarding vulnerable

54
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,280
vulnerability coordination topics with

55
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,360
organizations around the globe

56
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,720
and with that i would like to hand it

57
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,719
over to alan antono take it away

58
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,439
thank you hello welcome to a

59
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,079
presentation bridging the gap on s1

60
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,840
many of you probably have heard of

61
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,200
s-bomb already

62
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,840
but today we are going to talk about how

63
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,520
different organizations are working on

64
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,720
this topic

65
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,520
and the good things that came out of it

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,440
so that suco has kindly introduced us

67
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,720
but very briefly

68
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,680
uh i run nti cyber security initiatives

69
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,720
including

70
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,239
the global s-bom work uh now i started

71
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,920
working at jpgc about

72
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,400
five years ago actually as vendors email

73
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,599
address finder

74
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,480
and i'm now a cvd coordinator and i also

75
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,200
lead

76
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,400
international collaboration projects

77
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,840
so the challenge with virtual

78
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,360
conferences is not only do we have to be

79
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,720
more interesting than all the other

80
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,400
fascinating talks going on right now

81
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
but we have to be more interesting than

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
literally the entire internet

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,599
so we'll try to keep you entertained and

84
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,080
engaged today we're going to start off

85
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,840
by giving you an overview of s-bombs

86
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
some of you may know about it already

87
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,879
but we're going to give you some of the

88
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,040
motivating factors as well as a brief

89
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,920
overview of

90
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,760
what do we mean when we talk about

91
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,239
software bill of materials

92
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,879
now we'll touch on topics like uh how jp

93
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,920
sees s-bomb

94
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,400
and the survey we took from the vendors

95
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
as well as an excess for

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,040
japanese community along with allen so

97
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,760
the core takeaways today are going to be

98
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,440
depending a little bit on where you sit

99
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,560
if you wear a cert hat s-bombs as tomo

100
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,519
is going to highlight

101
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,360
uh can be a powerful tool to assist with

102
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,959
coordination if you're on the product

103
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,000
security side

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,680
we want you to appreciate that s-bombs

105
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,040
are coming this

106
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,840
is going to be how we do business and

107
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,280
can be incredibly powerful for

108
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,640
efficiency and efficacy

109
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
but this is your chance to roll up your

110
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,080
sleeves and really shape what that

111
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,120
future looks like

112
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,799
and indeed if anyone's interested about

113
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,560
the future of security and software

114
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,000
we're going to need your help to

115
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,480
demonstrate this technology

116
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,680
but the technical side and the

117
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,920
operational side works the way that we

118
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,080
intend it to do

119
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,200
so let's start with a couple of examples

120
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,840
um some of you have heard of a

121
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,400
vulnerability that was discovered in

122
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,560
2019

123
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,680
2019 called the urgent 11

124
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,480
vulnerabilities

125
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,200
it was originally thought to be a flaw

126
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,519
in

127
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,120
a real-time operating system called

128
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,640
vxworks now the problem with real-time

129
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,599
operating systems

130
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,920
is they're usually buried deep in some

131
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,200
embedded device

132
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,279
you look at that device and if you're

133
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,639
lucky enough to have a name on the side

134
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,120
of it

135
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,238
it's not going to say what the

136
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,320
underlying operating system is often the

137
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,000
real-time operating system is buried

138
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,160
several levers below and then it turns

139
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
out for this vulnerability

140
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,160
it wasn't just in this one rtos it was

141
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,759
actually in others

142
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,400
and one of the really fascinating things

143
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,080
about dealing with vulnerabilities

144
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,280
even in 2020 is surprisingly few

145
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,240
organizations can quickly and easily

146
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,880
answer

147
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,520
a very basic question am i affected when

148
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,120
we discover a vulnerability

149
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,440
does this affect me we think that is

150
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,360
just a not a very sustainable way of

151
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,280
doing business today

152
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,759
i want to talk about a second story uh

153
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,520
which is this very nice guy shlomi who's

154
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,280
the ceo of a small israeli company

155
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,240
called jasoff

156
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,759
they made some headlines this year and

157
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,400
presented at defcon

158
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,000
about a vulnerability that they found in

159
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,520
a trek ip library a very small library

160
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,600
uh that they turned the vulnerabilities

161
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,960
the ripple 20.

162
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,520
now the challenge was not the hard work

163
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,280
that they did to find this vulnerability

164
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,800
they had some equipment in the lab that

165
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,320
sort of said okay we know what's in this

166
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:22,880
device

167
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,240
but when they wanted to actually

168
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,320
disclose it to the vendors when they

169
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,919
wanted to say hey

170
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,440
we think that your product might be

171
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
affected they didn't know

172
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,600
who to reach out to they were forced to

173
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,160
go on linkedin

174
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,080
and scour linkedin looking for anyone

175
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
who was bragging about their

176
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,120
uh chops in the trek ip stack figure out

177
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,479
where that person worked

178
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,960
and then say well maybe that person is

179
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,160
using trek ip

180
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,919
so maybe they're affected and we should

181
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,080
notify them

182
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
and finding vendors contact is one of

183
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,160
the uh challenges the jp services

184
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,440
is facing now this is why i was hired

185
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,759
through jpcc in the first place and when

186
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,199
doing this sometimes we

187
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,160
look through open forums or we guess the

188
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,440
email address

189
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,319
or use stuff like wayback machine so i

190
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,759
think i know what kind of hassle should

191
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,919
only have to go through on this

192
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,039
so how do we solve this

193
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,280
here's a solution and but what is an

194
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,960
s-bomb

195
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,800
and i would like to first i would first

196
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,639
like to make sure that this is not super

197
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,560
bad of me the racing invests happening

198
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,919
in japan

199
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,800
but it's like a java application library

200
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,199
list

201
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,880
but with software components

202
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,919
so to get a little more detailed the

203
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,440
community has come up with

204
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,680
a a basic definition which is an s bomb

205
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,800
as a formal record

206
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,319
giving the details and supply chain

207
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,319
relationships of various components used

208
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,680
in building software

209
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,880
now in effect it amounts to a list of

210
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,919
ingredients

211
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,840
uh you go to the store you buy a piece

212
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,520
of candy it's going to come with a list

213
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,039
of ingredients

214
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,280
why don't we expect the same amount of

215
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,039
information from our software

216
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,400
another way of thinking about it is uh

217
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,800
you know it's just a dependency graph so

218
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,240
in this toy example we have on the

219
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,120
screen

220
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,000
acme app alliance or acme application uh

221
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,759
has two dependencies bingo buffer and

222
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,960
bob's browser

223
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,599
uh and in turn bob's browser we know

224
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,319
depends

225
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,800
on carol's compression engine now there

226
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,240
are a couple of things to note here

227
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,880
first

228
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,759
is we try to be explicit about what was

229
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,240
known

230
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
and what's unknown so for example in

231
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,440
this case we know that carroll's

232
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,560
compression engine

233
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,960
doesn't have any further dependencies on

234
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,680
the other hand

235
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,560
bingo buffer may or may not we simply

236
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,120
don't know

237
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,479
so this means that no one has to be

238
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,240
perfect exactly

239
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,759
so by being explicit about the

240
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,759
information that we have folks can sort

241
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,800
of ship what they have

242
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,039
and when you get an s-bomb you can now

243
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,919
say

244
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,599
okay this is the information i have and

245
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,120
this is the information i don't

246
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
now hopefully you can see it's not

247
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,039
covered up under the zoom windows

248
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,800
but for each of these components we

249
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
don't need that much information

250
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,080
now some of you are very very

251
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,759
sophisticated you've got a lot of

252
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,360
information about your supply chain

253
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,240
but to maximize the ease of adoption we

254
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,560
start off with a very straightforward

255
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,280
model

256
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,160
uh the minimum viable or the core s-bomb

257
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,000
doesn't require too much information

258
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,560
for each of these components we need who

259
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,240
the supplier is

260
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,319
what's the name of the component what's

261
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,919
the version so that we know if it's a

262
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,599
vulnerable or non-vulnerable version

263
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,520
and then what's the hash so that tomo

264
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,720
can be confident

265
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,479
that he and i are talking about the same

266
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,479
version and i'm not using some random

267
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,519
backdoor version

268
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,760
from github so not that much information

269
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,958
but with this information we think

270
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,519
you can do a lot now s-bomb won't

271
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,240
magically

272
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,920
fix anyone's problems but with this data

273
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,399
it's going to enable a lot of very

274
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,320
critical security use cases

275
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,800
uh and the range depends what it can do

276
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,320
depends on the hack that you wear

277
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,880
because software follows a very clear

278
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,480
life cycle right some of us

279
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
uh make software some of us choose

280
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,320
software buy software some of us

281
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,920
operate software most of us operate

282
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,000
software at some level and

283
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,560
sbom can help you whatever that role is

284
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,440
so for example

285
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,519
if you're making software it's very hard

286
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,880
to claim you have a secure development

287
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,600
model

288
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
if you aren't tracking what components

289
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,080
you're using right s-bombs allow you to

290
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,120
use allow lists and deny lists to track

291
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,120
end of life things like that

292
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,680
if you're in the business of managing

293
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,519
the risk whether it's about supply chain

294
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:31,760
or

295
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,600
general risk management s-bomb can

296
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,279
really be very helpful too

297
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,200
it's hard to claim that you are thinking

298
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,640
about where your software is coming from

299
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,519
if you can't see

300
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,440
that dependency tree and it's hard to

301
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,399
claim that you've thought thoroughly

302
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,279
about the risk

303
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,200
if you don't know that hey while this

304
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,440
component is fine it in turn depends on

305
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,560
something upstream

306
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,399
that i don't know anything about or even

307
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,640
worse has some red flags so you need

308
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,720
that visibility of the supply chain

309
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
and then finally of course uh

310
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,399
vulnerability management and tomo's

311
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,680
gonna talk a lot more about this

312
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,000
but it amounts to not being able to

313
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,880
defend

314
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,240
what you don't know about so

315
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,440
what have we tried to do well ntia for

316
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,279
the last two years has convened

317
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,519
an international multi-sector initiative

318
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,519
on software component transparency

319
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,160
to create a shared vision of what s-bomb

320
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,959
looks like

321
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,800
part of the challenge is we simply

322
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,320
didn't have this common vision

323
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,839
so no one was able to really drive

324
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,920
forward now the scope of this is quite

325
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,640
ambitious

326
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,320
we're trying to tackle the entire supply

327
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,079
chain right this isn't just

328
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,920
an open source problem it's not just a

329
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,279
commercial software problem

330
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,120
it's not just an embedded problem

331
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,519
although uh certainly for things like

332
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,279
medical devices or industrial control

333
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,560
systems um

334
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,079
it's very important because there's less

335
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,720
visibility in those spaces and of course

336
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,160
the customers need to be involved in

337
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
well this isn't transparency for its own

338
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,560
sake

339
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,959
the vision here is to make sure uh that

340
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,880
the data that we're sharing is is is

341
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,680
applicable and useful and as i touched

342
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,720
on

343
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,079
this is something that needs to cross

344
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,880
all sectors we all use the same software

345
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
and in fact one of the real dangers that

346
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,320
we saw is

347
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,720
seeing a unique solution for the

348
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,839
automotive sector

349
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,079
and the energy sector and what

350
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,519
governments buy because that

351
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,760
the potential to create a lot of waste

352
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,839
or potentially have a fragment ecosystem

353
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,880
so we wanted to make sure

354
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,320
that we maintain the idea that we're all

355
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,720
using the same software to do this

356
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,399
ntia has convened what we call the

357
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,000
multi-stakeholder process

358
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,160
it's open it's transparent it's

359
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,519
consensus based

360
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,079
uh the pen is held by the community nti

361
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,120
just facilitates it

362
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,200
and we help everyone hold hands and sing

363
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,079
kumbaya um but it has led to some great

364
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:36,880
progress

365
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,560
across the ecosystem and in fact

366
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,079
in addition to sort of describing the

367
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,680
issue we're starting to focus

368
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,079
on implementation we didn't want to

369
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,839
create a brand new standard

370
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,760
uh and the good news was that there were

371
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,720
already a couple standards out there

372
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,560
so the bad news is that there are

373
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,160
multiple standards out there uh these

374
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,760
are very powerful we're happy to chat

375
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,800
more about these

376
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,880
uh each of them have some respective

377
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,800
strengths uh so for example swift tags

378
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,839
are an iso standard

379
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,160
as well as some drawbacks so for example

380
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,120
spdx

381
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,839
and cyclone dx have much more active

382
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,360
current development communities

383
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,880
uh folks trying to figure out how to use

384
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,639
this today and

385
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,560
what we've done is to focus on

386
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,839
identifying the common elements

387
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,200
so we're not trying to pick a winner

388
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,160
here uh it's not a java ntia nor jp

389
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,680
cc exactly so our vision here

390
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,320
is to really uh emphasize the

391
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,000
interoperability between them and in

392
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
fact uh some participants

393
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,120
uh including vijay from cert cc at

394
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,079
carnegie mellon

395
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,720
has developed a tool that can maximize

396
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,480
interoperability so you can feed it

397
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,399
in s-bomb in one format and it'll spit

398
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,639
it out another the goal here is to make

399
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,279
sure

400
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,399
that people can pick what they want and

401
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,279
the ecosystem can still thrive

402
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,920
and speaking of translation uh in a

403
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,040
multilingual

404
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,279
ecosystem this is not only about the u.s

405
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,399
or english

406
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,240
speaking countries well this is a global

407
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,200
topic and this is the reason why jpg is

408
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,000
interested in this topic

409
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,440
so speaking of herself we are

410
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,920
an independent organization and of all

411
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,000
coordination activities cvd activity

412
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,839
is funded by the ministry of economy

413
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,600
trade and industry

414
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,360
and by the way the government is showing

415
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,720
a strong interest on

416
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,040
s-bomb also and it is being discussed in

417
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,480
a task force

418
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,399
and study group meetings are hosted by

419
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,839
them

420
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,760
and back to yourself we do vote

421
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,480
coordination on the japanese framework

422
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,320
also receive reports from overseas

423
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,560
directly and we work with other national

424
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,959
search and publish advisories on

425
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,760
our website

426
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,639
so why we need why do we need s-bomb uh

427
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,440
we

428
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,279
often handle multi-party coordination

429
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,199
cases where many vendors

430
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,800
are involved and i'm just going to call

431
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,880
it mp cvd here

432
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,760
and for mpcvds vendor's involvement is

433
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,920
essential because the information does

434
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
if the information doesn't get to the

435
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,519
affected vendors what is the point of

436
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,959
doing this

437
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,560
and i know in the audience there are

438
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,480
some people from large vendors

439
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,240
that do that do mpcvd on their own

440
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,360
and jpcc we do the same or very

441
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,880
similar things with you and so in mpcvd

442
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,680
we decide where to send the information

443
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,839
and for that we pick out the vendors

444
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,920
and when doing this uh we pick up the

445
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,160
vendors by keywords which they pick when

446
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,440
they register

447
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,320
to a framework and other than this we

448
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,040
depend on

449
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,600
our people's knowledge and memories and

450
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,880
as you can see

451
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,240
this is not the most accurate and

452
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,480
fastest way of picking up vendors

453
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,079
we need more accuracy and more speed

454
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,160
when doing this so we

455
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,519
we feel that s bomb and the transparency

456
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,399
that it will bring

457
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,560
would give clear directions for both

458
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,079
coordinators and the vendors

459
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,360
thank you and to tackle this issue we

460
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,279
took a survey from vendors in japan

461
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,839
we notified uh we sent notification to

462
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,839
318 vendors

463
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,639
uh some active some non-active and 57

464
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,600
vendors completed the answers

465
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,560
we are happy with the result but as you

466
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,320
can see this is not a large number

467
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,160
so starting with this we will try

468
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,320
expanding the number of both the total

469
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
and the answering vendors through

470
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,399
discussions and promotions

471
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,160
so you can see by the numbers uh this is

472
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,519
not all opinions of

473
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,160
japanese vendors but it helped us to

474
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,680
understand the rough trends

475
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,199
and from the next slide i will show some

476
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,040
of the answers that they gave us

477
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,639
and by the way if anyone would like to

478
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,240
know more about the survey and have

479
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,199
discussions on this

480
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,600
and we will we would be more than happy

481
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,720
to

482
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,000
all right so from the survey uh

483
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,199
on vol handling we asked them if they

484
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,360
would investigate when they receive

485
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,839
or obtain information from whatever the

486
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:54,959
sources are

487
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,040
and thank god most vendors say they

488
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,320
investigate 85 percent said yes

489
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,279
and we asked them in the time needed to

490
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,560
make decisions

491
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,800
for correspondence for the issue and

492
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,079
there are various answers

493
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,279
from an hour to four weeks and many

494
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,560
coordination cases

495
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,279
are disclosed before four weeks so i can

496
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,720
see some speed challenges here

497
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,160
and we also asked what their challenges

498
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,920
are in cbd

499
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,639
and several 36 percent said finding

500
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,959
obtaining the information is a challenge

501
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,839
and for this uh how are they going to

502
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,000
find out their relationships

503
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
with the issue if they don't know what

504
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,680
they have in their hands so here's

505
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,839
another tie to s-bomb

506
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,519
and the other free writing answers

507
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,880
included things like component

508
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,519
management automation piece of resources

509
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,519
and also we asked them if they would

510
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,959
consider fix for

511
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,360
non-exploitable looking issues and more

512
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,000
than half

513
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,279
64 said yes and this topic is currently

514
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,120
being discussed in s1 working groups

515
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,399
as uh vex issues so these are obvious

516
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,520
ties to s-bomb

517
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,640
and about third party components uh most

518
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,400
vendors use third-party components in

519
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,119
their products

520
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,439
94 so this is a norm today and 61

521
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,079
of them create component lists and

522
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,119
another question

523
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,119
if the vendors haven't requested to

524
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,640
provide component lists from

525
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,359
external organizations such as customers

526
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,679
for this several vendors said they had

527
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,880
36 percent and again how are they going

528
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,240
to do this if they don't know what they

529
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,320
have in their hands

530
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,000
and as for component naming we ask the

531
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,440
vendors if they

532
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
modify the names of the components that

533
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,480
they use

534
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,080
and 24 said they modify the component

535
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,120
names

536
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,600
and there's an issue here lack of a

537
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
global naming list

538
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,360
and this is currently being discussed in

539
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,719
spawn working groups as well

540
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,320
so let's see s-bomb we asked them if

541
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,960
they know

542
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,080
of s bomb and s bomb is well known

543
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,200
more than half on 56 56 percent said

544
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,559
they know this bomb

545
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,799
some in detail some just overviews but

546
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,840
some uh we can say that it's pretty

547
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,840
famous and vendors opinions for it

548
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,880
there was almost no objection just one

549
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,360
vendor

550
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,880
said no to it and this was only if the

551
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,240
information must go public

552
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,480
and another vendor one winner said

553
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
they are already using s-bomb so which i

554
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,919
think is uh

555
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,400
awesome then we asked the vendors if

556
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,280
they would like

557
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,880
to have us jpcc give guidance on s-bomb

558
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
and more than half said yes so we can

559
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,640
see some enough interest here

560
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,520
so vendor's value transparency

561
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,679
from the survey we saw that the vendors

562
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,640
face challenges

563
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,280
of cbd cost and speed and pcr efficiency

564
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,320
and their needs for asset management and

565
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,120
there was no

566
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,160
almost no objections from the uh for

567
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,400
the idea of s-bomb and there were

568
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
interest for s-bomb guidance

569
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,799
so we can say that there's enough needs

570
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,600
and interest here

571
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,520
so since we identified the needs

572
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,799
of for s-bomb where's the gap that needs

573
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,240
fulfilled

574
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,360
speaking of herself jp cersei's carrying

575
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:31,919
focus

576
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,120
or we can say it's our mission is that

577
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,840
is to

578
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,840
embed the cvd culture more here in japan

579
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,240
there are many spaces left for cbd

580
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,039
adoption

581
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,120
compared to uh compared to countries

582
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,200
like the united states

583
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,720
and also from the survey you can see

584
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,480
that there are many challenges that

585
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,160
pizzas are facing

586
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,039
so what do we use

587
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,159
s-bomb so we would like to use s-bomb as

588
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,679
a cvd adoption tool starting point for

589
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,200
beginners and level up

590
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,799
for more matured pieces and for this at

591
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,000
this point we need

592
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:20,320
guidance material and starter kit

593
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,000
and as for the concerns uh there are

594
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,440
some concerns

595
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,919
the vendors or the we have and one of

596
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:28,799
them is

597
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,240
who should have the access to smart data

598
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
lots of people when uh want data from

599
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,280
the upstream

600
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,559
and this can be a challenge in the

601
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,640
beginning but we would like to encourage

602
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,440
that

603
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,760
it is being shared from the downstream

604
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
as well and the data flows in both

605
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,000
directions in the supply chain

606
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and we are also curious if the vendors

607
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,919
will share this bomb data with jp

608
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,480
cc and this is because

609
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,080
it's in the next page after all these we

610
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,679
would like to build a cooperative

611
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,120
cvd system using s-bomb i make a

612
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,559
coordination much faster with the

613
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,720
automation aspect of s-bomb

614
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,039
and i believe that the possible drastic

615
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,919
increasing of speed of ball coordination

616
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,960
using s-bomb will only help the not only

617
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,280
help

618
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
will help the vendors but also their

619
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
society through the city

620
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,360
cbd stakeholders including the vendors

621
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,480
so what are the next steps for the

622
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,320
broader sbond community

623
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,360
i want to be clear uh and not overstate

624
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,000
that this is

625
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,159
a completely mature technology in fact

626
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,919
quite the opposite the benefit is

627
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,240
we're figuring it out together so tomo

628
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,440
touched on some of the issues that we're

629
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,480
currently working on

630
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
such as how do we tackle the question of

631
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,760
software name namespace right

632
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,520
use com.sun.java or com.oracle.java

633
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
we don't have a single way of talking

634
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,559
about software in fact

635
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,559
the problem isn't a lack of a standard

636
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,240
for software identity it's the fact that

637
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,799
we have

638
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,480
multiple ones and we're all using them

639
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,400
slightly differently

640
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,840
similarly how we're going to share this

641
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,320
s-bomb data with our partners

642
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,039
as tomo flagged they're going to be

643
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,480
different needs different demands

644
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,760
different things that different parties

645
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,000
are comfortable with we don't want to

646
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,600
find a single solution we're not going

647
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,720
to force everyone to do everything the

648
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,520
same way

649
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,600
but we think that we can provide some

650
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,720
guidance to say

651
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,880
here's a small set of ways to do it so

652
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,919
that customers

653
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,480
and suppliers aren't doing a million

654
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,600
different things

655
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,360
last issue i want to flag is this

656
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,720
question of vulnerability versus

657
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,679
exploitability

658
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,600
those of you in the pcr world know that

659
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,200
there are going to be vulnerabilities

660
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,280
in an underlying component that simply

661
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,799
don't affect your customers the way

662
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,240
you've used it or built it

663
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,600
doesn't allow that vulnerability to be

664
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,919
exploited there's an ongoing work to

665
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:40,880
figure out how

666
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,120
in addition to s-bomb suppliers can

667
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,400
communicate downstream

668
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
the lack of exploitability in a way that

669
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,679
they're comfortable with

670
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,720
so beyond thinking about the

671
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,880
architectural issues uh we're focusing

672
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,240
on building this today

673
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,559
so what tools exist there already are a

674
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,280
number of them

675
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,720
uh some of them are open source some of

676
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,159
their commercial that are able to

677
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,240
generate s-bombs and consume s-bombs

678
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,679
in the data formats that we already

679
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,240
talked about moreover we're interested

680
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,600
in sort of helping folks

681
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,440
learn how to use this both getting the

682
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,720
message out and if you're interested

683
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,120
today we'd love to have you involved

684
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,960
thinking about draft contract language

685
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,880
so you can start to ask for s-bombs from

686
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,640
your suppliers today

687
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,520
as well as proof-of-concept exercises so

688
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:19,919
that

689
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,320
folks can show that this works for their

690
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,120
community

691
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,960
over the last two years the healthcare

692
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,159
sector in the united states

693
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,480
has actually been doing this and it's a

694
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,000
sign of how important it is

695
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,919
to that community that in the middle of

696
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,440
all of this in the middle of the world's

697
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,679
worst public health crisis

698
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,960
this is something that remains a

699
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,880
priority to american medical device

700
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,000
manufacturers or rather

701
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,960
international medical device

702
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,279
manufacturers and american hospitals

703
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,960
uh there are other sectors that are

704
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,559
starting to ramp up on this including

705
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,159
for example the automotive sector

706
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,240
which is going to have participants from

707
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,200
uh

708
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,960
japan and germany as well as the united

709
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,640
states and lastly

710
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,480
we're focused on thinking about these

711
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
play books and how-to guides that tomo

712
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,760
talked about

713
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,279
we want to make sure that if you're

714
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,440
interested you won't have to start from

715
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,880
scratch that there'll be some

716
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,480
tools that you can use to pick up and

717
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,080
say all right if i do it this way

718
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,000
here's my next step if i do it this way

719
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,440
here's my next step and that's an

720
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,880
emerging part that we're focusing on

721
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,600
you're on mute toma no worries

722
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,440
sorry about that uh so the next steps in

723
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,600
japan will be on stir s bomb adoption

724
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,200
using guidance materials and starter

725
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,000
kits

726
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,320
and also have more discussions on s-bomb

727
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,320
for example the vendor meetings that we

728
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:32,799
host

729
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,760
uh twice a year and also localization

730
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,520
and that is we are planning on reviewing

731
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,039
and giving inputs to the documents

732
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,880
created by the xbomb adoption working

733
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,000
group and translate

734
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,320
them into japanese language

735
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,000
so what's the future of s-bomb uh

736
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,200
the vision here is first to say that you

737
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,559
know this is coming

738
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,360
uh this is going to be something uh you

739
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,320
know organizations

740
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,080
can already produce partial s-bombs

741
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,120
today the goal of the broader community

742
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,799
is to see what we can do to make this an

743
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,320
expectation in the marketplace

744
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,760
uh to help people say oh this is

745
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,279
something that i'm going to be asked for

746
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,799
and then i can start to look for to help

747
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,080
defend my product

748
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,840
and to make that a reality we need to

749
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,120
make it easier and cheaper

750
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,840
to generate s-bombs uh as well as more

751
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,440
efficient and effective to consume this

752
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,320
data

753
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
which means slotting it into the various

754
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,559
tools on both the production side

755
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,000
as well as the consumption side and

756
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,840
we're building that ecosystem around it

757
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,240
today

758
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,400
right as i said s-bomb isn't going to

759
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,000
solve all of our problems

760
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,400
uh but we think that with this data it

761
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,840
can really slot in

762
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,080
now there's a great role for this

763
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,039
community to play

764
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,120
both for the search and the pcert level

765
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,360
um so for example promoting these proof

766
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,440
of concept exercises that i talked about

767
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,159
uh identifying obstacles so as we sort

768
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,200
of think through it what are some things

769
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,320
i'm worried about

770
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,919
what are some of the solutions and of

771
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,559
course signaling interest in adoption

772
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,039
so for example anissa just published

773
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,000
some guidance

774
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,559
on iot supply chain security where they

775
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,080
explicitly called out

776
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,400
s-bombs not just as a technical issue

777
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,000
but as a process issue we should start

778
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,880
thinking about

779
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,480
one thing i would like to add is that

780
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,080
you know s-bomb has been brought up and

781
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,440
discussed in the iso world as well

782
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,000
and so if you would like to know more or

783
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,960
get involved

784
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,400
uh there are some documents that are

785
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,240
published at ntia.gov

786
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,039
s-bomb these are not written by the

787
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,080
american government

788
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,640
these are written by the community uh

789
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,960
they've been drafted by these open

790
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,880
international working groups uh they've

791
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,760
had feedback tomo gets up and stays up

792
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,279
all night for our quarterly

793
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,880
multi-stakeholder meetings

794
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,120
uh and is able to weigh in we really

795
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,159
appreciate that

796
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,799
someday we'll do it on your time and if

797
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,080
you want to know about the process

798
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,039
mti.gov software transparency the next

799
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,480
meeting will be held

800
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,159
in early january you'll be announcing

801
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,679
that uh and

802
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,000
you can send me an email to get on my uh

803
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,440
broadcast announcement list

804
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,600
if you reach out to both of us to start

805
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,880
the conversation

806
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,799
what i'll do is i'll send you a sticker

807
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,159
that's the way that you know

808
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,480
that your cool infosec project is we

809
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,000
have stickers

810
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and so if you reach out to us to start

811
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,760
the conversation even if it's just to

812
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
say that we're idiots

813
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,520
we want to start that conversation and

814
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,120
engage with you and your team

815
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,919
uh and and then you can uh you know have

816
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,600
some fun things on your laptops

817
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,559
so with that uh i think we have some

818
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,919
time for questions

819
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,840
and so uh thank you so much for your

820
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,039
time

821
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,480
thank you thank you again so we have

822
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,799
two minutes so let's see how many we can

823
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,399
get quickly

824
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,679
okay so can't we use nvds common product

825
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,080
enumeration cpe for software namespace

826
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,399
that's a great question uh the short

827
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,640
version is that is one of the solutions

828
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,720
people are also using things like

829
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,559
package url or perl

830
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,640
the other challenge is our friends at

831
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,159
nist have publicly said that they're

832
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,520
going to be deprecating

833
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,799
cpe in favor of something called swid

834
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,720
and the challenge there is we don't have

835
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,360
full guidance so while cpe is useful for

836
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,240
mapping

837
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,840
other people are using other solutions

838
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,600
today

839
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,080
um and as you mentioned it so any idea

840
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,000
when nist will transition away from cp

841
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,480
to suite

842
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,960
you know my friends at nist have a lot

843
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,640
of things on their plate i know this is

844
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,480
a key priority for them

845
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,159
one of the challenges is suid as it's

846
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,919
currently written doesn't allow wild

847
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:26,480

848
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480

849
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,600

we know it okay in other words we don't

854
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,559
know at the moment

855
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,880
okay so it was mentioned that there was

856
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,480
a tool that converted between different

857
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,080
formats i missed that

858
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,760
uh where that was i missed where that

859
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,240
was

860
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,919
or what that was should we share that

861
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,080
information i will try to share that

862
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,200

870
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,840
uh so while you are looking so ca

871
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,399
csaf which is a format for machine

872
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,159
readable security advisories is looking

873
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,520
into supporting s-bomb and

874
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,320
csaf 2.0 what do you recommend to use

875
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,840
one standard

876
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,600
one standard since they are convertible

877
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,600
or all of them

878
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,120
that's a great question and in fact

879
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,720
we're going to be meeting

880
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,480
with omar santos who's the chair of that

881
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,320
effort this week later this week

882
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,120
uh and um uh you know i

883
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,520
we take a position of being radically

884
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,399
ecumenical

885
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,720
and as tomo mentioned it's not our job

886
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,480
to sort of say this one is the best

887
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,919
but we're happy to present the strengths

888
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,320
and weaknesses uh or or introduce you

889
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,679
with representatives from each of those

890
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:58,399
formats

891
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,080
and if if they decide that one's the

892
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,399
better starting point that's fine

893
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,520
tell you any other thoughts on that

894
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,399
