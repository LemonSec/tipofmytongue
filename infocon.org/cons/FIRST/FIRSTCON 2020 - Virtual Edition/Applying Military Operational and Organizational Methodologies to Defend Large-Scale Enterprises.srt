operations and

35
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,840

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,200
information network

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,320

cool awesome good morning everyone as um

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,079
gentlemen mentioned my name is nicholas

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,560
liu

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,159
i'm currently the assistant director of

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,920
operations at the united states air

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,560
force

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,400
computer emergency response team based

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,920
out of san antonio texas

49
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,520
i've been here for about three years

50
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,360
having started as a tier one analyst

51
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,399
moving to being in charge of the

52
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,479
incident response section um to seeing

53
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,920
overseeing current operations and then

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,520
where i am now as the assistant knox

55
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,720
director

56
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,040
so we'll go ahead and get started so i

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,640
apologize for the crappiest truck that

58
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,079
might hear in the background um official

59
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:58,799
disclaimer

60
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,320
these are my personal opinions as you

61
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,880
see on the screen

62
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,040
so the theme of this year's first

63
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,799
conference is where defenders share what

64
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,479
drew me to want to present my unit's

65
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,000
experiences on this topic was the

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,360
massive problem sets

67
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,879
and our subsequent growth and solutions

68
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,400
in this area over the last couple of

69
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,440
years

70
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,800
so we at the air force computer

71
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,400
emergency response team are the

72
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,840
enterprise level stock for the united

73
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,040
states air force

74
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,239
like other stocks for large

75
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,920
organizations working at the enterprise

76
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,680
level means the responsibility

77
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,000
and coverage of terrain is immense i

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,440
would describe the responsibilities that

79
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,920
we have

80
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,879
at the ascert as being a mix of both

81
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
being tactical so doing the triage

82
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,440
incident

83
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,599
response analysis that sort of thing as

84
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,200
well as being having that coordinating

85
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,840
function

86
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,200
so working with a lot of other sub

87
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,519
organizations to conduct that instant

88
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,760
response across the enterprise

89
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,680
so over my last couple of years of my

90
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,280
time at the officer cooperating with

91
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,560
other defenders is an immensely

92
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,080
important topic

93
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,280
given that our organizational

94
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,480
environment is a is a very

95
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,200
difficult challenge

96
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,680
so similar to other enterprise

97
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,599
organizations working at scale on one of

98
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,200
the world's largest networks

99
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,560
with large number of endpoints and

100
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,000
customers presents its own unique

101
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,800
challenges

102
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,120
so for us we have about 750 000

103
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,080
endpoints

104
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,879
about a million users and a large number

105
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,920
of networks

106
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,360
and across all that entire network

107
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,519
architecture you have a diversity of

108
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,800
operating systems

109
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,159
policies protocols etc standardization

110
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,280
is very difficult

111
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,560
i'm sure that's that's pretty common

112
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
amongst national level um c-series at

113
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,680
this point

114
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,920
that's not the end of our trouble so

115
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,360
with this next slide i'll walk through a

116
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,400
little bit of the air force's

117
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,920
organizational architecture for cyber

118
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,319
security it's really complex

119
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,480
again because of the size of our network

120
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,760
so starting with how the air force is

121
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,400
structured

122
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,159
so starting the left-hand side you have

123
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,640
major commands so think u.s air forces

124
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,720
in the pacific u.s air force in europe

125
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,879
u.s air force global strike command a

126
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,840
major command

127
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,519
can have thousands of people across

128
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,200
dozens of bases

129
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,040
these major commands at all these bases

130
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,040
have multiple wings just a unit

131
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,599
a type of unit a group a squadron

132
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,519
underneath them

133
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,200
and there's a diversity of purposes in

134
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,439
all these units so some squadrons

135
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,200
they'll support flying missions some

136
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,879
will be just be our local finance office

137
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,720
to make sure people get paid

138
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,159
some are to support for research and

139
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,320
development for weapon systems

140
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,000
so of course that means you have a

141
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,358
massive i.t need

142
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,880
and therefore a massive cyber skier

143
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,960
needed to protect everything

144
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,880
going back to how the asteroid is both a

145
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,960
tactical and coordinating stock

146
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,720
i couldn't draw all the organizations

147
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,080
here on this one slide because then it

148
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,000
would look like a huge spider web

149
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
you see here there's this huge number of

150
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,040
organizations

151
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,199
to support everything some of these have

152
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,320
different functions

153
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,080
some are just your regular i t folk at a

154
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,840
base who don't have like a background in

155
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,800
cyber security

156
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,400
um others are nation cyber security

157
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
units specifically defiant defend

158
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,479
airplanes and their uh underlying i.t

159
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,840
infrastructure others are just

160
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,919
coordinating centers so you have a

161
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,000
diversity of organizations

162
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,840
in this space for us

163
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,160
so as shown in the last slide you know

164
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,680
there's diversity of responsibility

165
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,160
and authority for cyber security um you

166
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,840
have solid organizations that only have

167
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,360
their small piece of the pie

168
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,479
uh from what i've seen um you know you

169
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:10,800
have

170
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,160
each organization is not going to have a

171
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,199
different network architecture that

172
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,160
they're supporting

173
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,360
they're going to have different maturity

174
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,039
levels so whether like they're training

175
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,320
they have different training pipelines

176
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,000
or how they do cyber security

177
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,360
they'll have different capabilities if

178
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,639
you talk about tactics techniques and

179
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,520
procedures

180
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,440
um people have different playbooks for

181
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,280
that um different toolkits some people

182
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,919
use different um they they connect their

183
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,520
cybersecurity different ways

184
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,759
um responsibility again some are like

185
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,440
like us at the enterprise where we are

186
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,039
persistent we conduct persistent cyber

187
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,800
security 24 7.

188
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,479
some are only temporary whenever they

189
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,479
move around to different locations

190
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,400
i mean and as a result you have

191
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,000
different reporting mechanisms so

192
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,320
based on the leadership so for instance

193
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,000
at a local air force base

194
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,080
um the wing commander right there might

195
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,919
have different reporting requirements uh

196
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,319
for his local cyber security unit than

197
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,680
us for instance

198
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,280
um so what what i've really seen from

199
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,440
that is it creates an organizational

200
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,360
culture like across the air force

201
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,039
where everyone really has their small

202
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,120
piece of the pie and really focuses on

203
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,880
what they want to do

204
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,479
therefore they don't necessarily want to

205
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,840
cooperate with other people just because

206
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,560
they don't know

207
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,280
what the possibilities of that are and

208
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,720
as a result you know kind of with how

209
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,080
the military is

210
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,440
traditionally structured and wanting to

211
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,280
take orders from higher up and execute

212
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,199
those orders at a lower level

213
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,639
you have an organizational culture that

214
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,319
becomes risk adverse

215
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,000
and wanting to get after defending your

216
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
network so i added this last point the

217
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,120
culture of relying on higher

218
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,560
headquarters for decisions

219
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,600
because that's really what we're trying

220
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,840
to solve here um by talking about

221
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,759
a military framework that can adjust to

222
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,199
the scale and this problem set

223
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,319
so now that we've kind of talked about

224
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,160
how you know the united states air force

225
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,039
at a large scale

226
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,479
cybersecurity enterprise faces these

227
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,400
problem sets this is what we're up

228
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,080
against so the adversary if you look at

229
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,880
the crowdstrike

230
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,039
global threat report for 2019 um they

231
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,560
talk about these breakout times so

232
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,440
breakout time

233
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
um is the time it takes for an intruder

234
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,039
to get into the network and then move

235
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,080
laterally once

236
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,560
um you see up there with russia being 18

237
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,319
minutes and 49 seconds

238
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,840
that is immensely fast that is an

239
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,520
incredibly fast time um

240
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,800
given how long it takes to coordinate

241
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
conduct instant response actions and if

242
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,560
everything is not automated

243
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
so given that you know and knowing kind

244
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,840
of the background of

245
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,680
how we as an organization have to

246
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
function when everyone is in their silos

247
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,800
how do we address this problem and say

248
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,160
it's a huge problem set for what we're

249
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,199
working with

250
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,280
um i like to liken that to the idea of a

251
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,400
wicked problem

252
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,599
so it's a problem that's difficult and

253
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,520
possible to solve um because

254
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,919
of the scale um contradictory knowledge

255
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,120
contradictory orders different

256
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,560
organizations working

257
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,840
and not necessarily rolling in the same

258
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,759
direction i mean how well interconnected

259
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,479
they are

260
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,919
so that that bottom line there you see

261
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,280
with hundreds of cyber security

262
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,080
organizations

263
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,680
that have differing and unknown maturity

264
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,879
levels sometimes you might not really

265
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,840
know

266
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,120
priorities responsibilities

267
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
relationships that coordination

268
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,000
synchronization

269
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,160
at the enterprise level against an

270
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,240
adversary that is increasingly fast

271
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,919
becomes a wicked problem in my mind

272
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,759
so how do we solve this right luckily

273
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,160
um being from the us military the issue

274
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,960
of organizing

275
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,319
training equipping and executing

276
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,560
military operations at scale is not

277
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,000
something fundamentally new to the

278
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,800
military

279
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,039
so regardless of the domain think about

280
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,639
not just the united states air force but

281
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,319
um your nation's respective military how

282
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,520
they're going to coordinate your land

283
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,199
forces your sea forces

284
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,240
your space forces your cyber forces

285
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
all together to create combined effects

286
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,919
so or think combined operations so

287
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,599
allied nations that work together

288
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,199
they also have this problem of scale

289
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,640
regardless of the domain so

290
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,440
they'll have to figure out how to

291
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,799
coordinate all their land forces their

292
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,399
air forces etc

293
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,320
um so that manifests itself in this idea

294
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,599
of something in the military called

295
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,200
command and control

296
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,039
defined as the exercise of authority and

297
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,800
direction by a properly designated

298
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,440
commander

299
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,360
over assigned and attached forces in the

300
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,720
accomplishment of a mission it's not

301
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,959
command and control in the botnet sense

302
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:51,839
that's not what we're talking about here

303
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,360
but it is sort of related right so you

304
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,000
have to be able to

305
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,320
move around your forces in an effective

306
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,240
way to get after this problem instead of

307
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,000
how fast the adversary moves in cyber

308
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,560
so as for command and control there are

309
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,800
a couple of different models out there

310
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,240
so when you break down the idea of

311
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,920
command and control in your head think

312
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,959
about it in two

313
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,959
along sort of two different lines um so

314
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,480
you have your your planning piece of it

315
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,839
and then your execution piece of it so

316
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,040
the planning piece of it or

317
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,680
the intent that can be centralized or

318
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,800
decentralized

319
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,320
so for your intent piece if you have a

320
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,399
centralized intent what that means is

321
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,000
you're all getting on the same page

322
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,600
all together and planning about what you

323
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,000
want to do if it's decentralized you

324
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,680
don't have that plan everyone is kind of

325
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,880
doing their own little thing

326
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,560
for the execution piece of it a

327
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,800
centralized execution

328
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,720
means that anytime you want to make a

329
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,320
decision to affect something you have to

330
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,000
go through higher headquarters

331
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,920
for them to approve that decision you

332
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,519
can kind of see how that in

333
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,600
working that you know for cyber security

334
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,279
that takes time and again again working

335
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,000
with our current problem

336
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,600
set of how fast our adversaries move

337
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,279
that's not necessarily acceptable

338
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,800
you can also have a decentralized

339
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,560
execution where everyone will kind of

340
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,600
execute

341
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,000
along whatever the intent how however

342
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,480
the intent was originally formed

343
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,640
so i would say for us in the air force

344
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,399
right now um sometimes it's a mix

345
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:06,959
between

346
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,519
um centralized intent and centralized

347
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,399
execution

348
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,240
um where everything is directly planned

349
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,839
specifically you know you need to look

350
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,680
at this specific ip address

351
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,519
um and then centralized execution where

352
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,800
whenever i need to work with another

353
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,399
unit i have to go upward

354
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,800
to go downward that takes time um

355
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,160
sometimes it's the other end where it's

356
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,120
decentralized

357
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,680
intent and decentralized execution where

358
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,200
not everyone is necessarily on the same

359
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,079
page

360
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,160
and when they execute um they're they're

361
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,360
just working

362
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,240
um whatever they see fit so really the

363
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,320
model that i have kind of in my mind

364
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,160
seemed to work more successfully is this

365
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,680
idea of mission command that's the

366
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,200
command and control model

367
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,120
um so going back to that intent and

368
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,959
execution piece that is centralized

369
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,399
intent so everyone getting on the same

370
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,519
page together

371
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,079
and then decentralized execution um

372
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:52,959
being able to

373
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,560
work loudly within the teams not having

374
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,480
to go up and then downward

375
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,920
in order to accomplish the mission the

376
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,519
inspiration for this came from reading a

377
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,079
book

378
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,680
by general stanley mcchrystal he was the

379
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,040
he was the commander in afghanistan and

380
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,320
also the commander of joint special

381
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,000
operations command his book team of

382
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,560
teams

383
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,079
new rules of engagement for a complex

384
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,480
world so what the premise of that book

385
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,959
talked about how being able to work with

386
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,880
different intelligence agencies

387
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,560
different military organizations under

388
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,399
this mission command framework

389
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,839
where they weren't waiting for higher

390
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,519
leadership to execute

391
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,720
because of how fast they needed to react

392
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,160
in terms of emission in afghanistan and

393
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,920
special operations

394
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,760
being able to to have that centralized

395
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,000
intent and a decentralized execution

396
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,760
was a way to get after that that time

397
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,839
issue this has all this has

398
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,279
this idea of mission command has its

399
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,519
roots in the industrial area so when

400
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,320
prussian military generals um started

401
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,040
scaling up

402
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,480
their armies upward and they needed to

403
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,160
be able to move forces

404
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,560
all around the continent um but they

405
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,920
couldn't wait on

406
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
trying to make a decision wait wait for

407
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,200
like

408
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,720
their messages be transmitted across

409
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,480
each other this was the model that they

410
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,760
came up with to execute

411
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,800
and be successful at what they did so

412
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
i'm thinking that if you know this model

413
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,160
has been successful in the past how can

414
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,360
we apply this to

415
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
the enterprise sock where we're

416
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,959
commanding and controlling

417
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,240
hundreds of different cyber security

418
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,600
organizations how do we get this on the

419
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,120
same page

420
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,279
so a little bit more in depth about what

421
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,720
mission command is these are the key

422
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,440
tenets

423
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,800
so building cohesive teams through

424
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,360
mutual trust general mcchrystal

425
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,600
um he manifests this in the idea of

426
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,760
liaison officers so lnos

427
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,519
so sending your people down to other

428
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,519
people's units and vice versa to really

429
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,680
get a sense of what each unit does

430
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,440
that helps bridge the information gap as

431
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,680
far as what i know versus what you know

432
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,519
and how can we come together

433
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,120
creating shared consciousness and shared

434
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,720
understanding i'm again it's not just

435
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,000
technology i'm not going to touch too

436
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,279
much on technology here but

437
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,440
um having the idea to know what other

438
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,560
organizations are thinking

439
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,600
what their ttps are even just

440
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,760
um coming from the same training

441
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,040
pipeline so for instance

442
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,600
um us special forces for specific units

443
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,440
they'll all train together

444
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,120
that way they can really understand how

445
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,560
they all operate together

446
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,639
um and what they're thinking at the time

447
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,240
to be able to react to things

448
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,360
so it's creating that shared

449
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,880
understanding and shared consciousness

450
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,760
the third one

451
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,240
providing clear commander's intent again

452
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,839
with mission command comes centralized

453
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:14,880
execution

454
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,079
your outcomes have to be very well

455
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,920
defined and understood understood

456
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,880
amongst all your team of teams

457
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,800
exercise discipline initiative this

458
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,920
speaks more to

459
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,560
being able to take action as you see fit

460
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,000
without having to wait for approval for

461
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,680
things so what the military calls fog

462
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,560
and friction

463
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,079
or essentially not having complete

464
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,519
information or communication at all

465
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,880
times

466
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,480
exercising discipline initiative means

467
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,399
making risk informed decisions

468
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,079
without waiting higher without waiting

469
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,480
for higher guidance from leadership

470
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,320
because again the problem said of how we

471
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,839
face and how fast the adversary

472
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,040
adversary moves we have to make a

473
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,199
decision at some point

474
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,560
the fifth point mission orders that's

475
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,480
more specific to the military

476
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
but essentially what it means is

477
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,839
whoever's in charge and how you're going

478
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,920
to do that centralized

479
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,800
intent you define the outcome but you

480
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,079
don't necessarily define how to get

481
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,360
there you leave that for the teams to

482
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,880
figure out so that way

483
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,440
other issues can be focused upon the

484
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,040
last one accepting prudent risk

485
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,800
that's mostly self-explanatory since

486
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,560
that's our business of really

487
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,839
managing risk as cyber security

488
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
professionals

489
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,199
so from the app store i'm going to

490
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,639
highlight two vignettes that emphasize

491
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,760
mission command

492
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,880
the first one dealt with trying to

493
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,240
figure out what enterprise hunt looked

494
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,959
like

495
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,959
it started off in the summer of 2018

496
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,120
utilizing organic ascert manpower to

497
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,440
find an advanced persistent threat

498
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,880
the outcomes of this hunt revealed that

499
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,079
we needed to start collaborating with

500
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,600
other mission partners rather than just

501
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,560
working internally

502
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,880
or inorganically with our own manpower

503
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,639
that led to a re-attack in the fall

504
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,000
where he worked with a singular mission

505
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,680
partner at local stock

506
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,199
another base to find an advanced

507
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,120
persistent threat

508
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,440
again that also that that sort of pilot

509
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,040
showed that we needed to scale upward

510
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,240
and work with a lot of other mission

511
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,360
partners that are out there so whether

512
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,320
or not it's the

513
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,040
knock deployable threat hunters more

514
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,639
local socks

515
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,160
this the cycle of experimentation

516
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,480
carried onward into the winter of 2019

517
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,079
or 2018 and early 2019 um

518
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,920
with a specific task force that we made

519
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,839
to conduct an enterprise hunt on the air

520
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,880
operations center

521
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,279
at scott air force base so that supports

522
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,560
a lot of the

523
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,079
air mobility operations so think of the

524
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,920
planes that refill other planes

525
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,880
planes that carry a lot of cargo that's

526
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,199
the

527
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,320
that's the area we were looking for

528
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,079
so what does mission command really mean

529
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,600
um when we're talking about the specific

530
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,040
task force right

531
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,720
so we had a few deliberate phases so the

532
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,880
first one was deliberate planning

533
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,000
you see there the list of mission

534
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,160
partners that we had so we had local

535
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,680
security operations centers deployable

536
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,880
threat hunt teams

537
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,480
an organization specifically devoted

538
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,399
threat intelligence us as the enterprise

539
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,600
stock

540
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,959
your knock and then the owners of the

541
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,920
actual air operations center network

542
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,079
so we actually flew everyone out here um

543
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,839
to san antonio to come meet us

544
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,360
and took the critical step of defining

545
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,720
roles and responsibilities for each

546
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,680
member

547
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,360
that manifested itself in a document

548
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,639
called the information exchange

549
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,680
requirements

550
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,360
um figuring out each team's capabilities

551
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,880
what they brought to the fight as well

552
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,279
as

553
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,920
um what we needed from everybody else so

554
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,199
if i'm the enterprise talk

555
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,839
i don't necessarily know some of the

556
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,040
very intimate details

557
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,480
of that local environment that that

558
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,399
local stock is going to know

559
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,240
that can help inform me in my decision

560
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,600
as i push forward with

561
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,800
preparation of the environment which

562
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,639
i'll talk to in the next slide

563
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,079
secondly the establishment of mission

564
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,519
command is the appropriate command and

565
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,560
control model so

566
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,839
when you bring a bunch of organizations

567
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,839
together you need to identify

568
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,120
hey how are you going to communicate

569
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,560
what is the framework for doing this so

570
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,920
for us this was us trying mission

571
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,040
command

572
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,120
being able to work laterally with each

573
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,639
team member without having to go

574
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,880
go upward and go downward that which

575
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,000
would take time

576
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,600
this was pretty revolutionary for us in

577
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,279
the sense that for the first time we had

578
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,800
all the relevant players to construct

579
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,040
conduct a full-scale cyber security

580
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,880
at multiple levels so not just the the

581
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,320
local level but the enterprise level

582
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,199
so what does this look like when we're

583
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,160
actually doing preparation in the

584
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,240
environment

585
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
so once we established everyone's

586
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,600
information exchange requirements

587
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,480
answers began

588
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,559
flowing back and forth without having to

589
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,280
push it to the task force commander

590
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,280
which you know again going up and down

591
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,039
and having to get approval for a lot of

592
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,079
things is the current

593
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,160
is how the air force mostly current does

594
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,599
it and that's that

595
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,079
takes time right um so as enterprise

596
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,199
stock what this meant is getting a

597
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,959
better understanding of the specific air

598
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,160
operation center network

599
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,640
and coordination with a with a knock and

600
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,319
a local stock for a better data logging

601
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:26,880
strategy

602
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,039
again relying on that socks that local

603
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,160
stock's intimate knowledge of the

604
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,640
environment um you know how many systems

605
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,760
they had

606
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,960
what sort of people worked there what

607
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,919
sort of software is supposed to be

608
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,600
implemented etc

609
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,960
for coordination with the threat

610
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,160
intelligence organization what that

611
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,679
meant is creating hunt packages so

612
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,039
passing a lot of that information on

613
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,440
what's on that local network

614
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,039
to the threat intelligence organization

615
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,520
to define vulnerability scans and

616
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,799
create hunt packages for what we're

617
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,200
going to look for the third point there

618
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,720
training of threat intelligence analysts

619
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,640
alongside threat hunters to build trust

620
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,000
we actually got some of the threat

621
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,600
intelligence analysts from the threat

622
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,000
intelligence

623
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,080
organization and had them trained with

624
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,200
our team

625
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,360
for a couple months actually so them

626
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,960
being able to understand

627
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,919
how we operate how we how we what our

628
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,280
ttps are

629
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,440
how they're going to get on mission um

630
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,799
that goes back to general crystal's

631
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,320
point of building cohesive teams through

632
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,760
mutual trust

633
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,080
so that that played a huge part in the

634
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,760
actual execution of it

635
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,440
a big point here that i want to note as

636
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,600
as tasks uh popped up

637
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,679
for our teams we operate independently

638
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,799
in the fact that we

639
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,760
coordinated with the other teams

640
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,080
directly and then just

641
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,240
just gave the task force commander an

642
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,000
awareness just for sa

643
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,360
but we didn't have to go to approval for

644
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,120
this because at that point on the ground

645
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,799
we are the ones that are the experts and

646
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,080
are able to

647
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,360
talk to it more quickly and make a

648
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,640
decision rather than having to go

649
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,840
through the task force commander so that

650
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,720
saves us a lot of time

651
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,880
so as for the actual execution of the

652
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,160
speeds um the highlights of mission

653
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,480
command from our perspective were

654
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,760
being able to better integrate

655
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,520
intelligence through intelligence

656
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,400
into our operations so having the threat

657
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,679
intelligence analysts um

658
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,919
sit directly next to us whenever an

659
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:04,960
operator found something that they

660
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,000
thought might be suspicious

661
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,200
they could pass that to the threat

662
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,120
intelligence analysts who have access to

663
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,960
the greater intelligence community

664
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,640
to conduct requests for information and

665
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,080
better contextualize

666
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,880
what they found the second the second

667
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,600
piece and

668
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,520
in my mind the biggest takeaway from

669
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,200
that is that enterprise the local stock

670
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,640
coordination

671
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,480
being able to validate what we saw at

672
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,760
the enterprise level as suspicious

673
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,320
activity

674
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,799
um again because that local sock knew

675
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,000
that intimate knowledge of their

676
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,200
environment they knew who was supposed

677
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,320
to be there they knew what sort of

678
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,360
software is supposed to be there what

679
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,400
they were supposed to be using

680
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,640
um they they knew if any past events had

681
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,919
happened that

682
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,840
may have contributed to what we saw as

683
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,280
suspicious that day

684
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,960
i would say for us as the enterprise

685
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,640
level again having to work with

686
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,480
hundreds of different organizations that

687
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,000
local stock coordination

688
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,520
significantly lowered our response time

689
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,000
to validate suspicious activity

690
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,480
and again whenever we executed this was

691
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,520
all done

692
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,440
directly with the teams this wasn't

693
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,559
necessarily having to go through the

694
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,080
task force commander which again saved

695
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,480
this time

696
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,640
so the second vignette that i'll talk

697
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,559
about um it wasn't a planned hunt it was

698
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,080
more of an incident response

699
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,720
at the time but we did utilize some of

700
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,640
the lessons learned from mission command

701
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,320
with the first vignette to apply to this

702
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,000
second issue so

703
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,240
um some a few a few months later some of

704
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,840
organic sensors detected suspicious

705
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,960
activity that revealed the

706
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,919
system was compromised

707
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,600
but by using that kind of concept of

708
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,880
mission command reaching out to

709
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,080
different organizations getting on the

710
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,520
same page conducting centralized

711
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,320
planning

712
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,520
to figure out how everyone is going to

713
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,120
be executing in the future determining

714
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,480
mission command as your command and

715
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,760
control framework

716
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,679
we were able to reach out to local socks

717
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,320
to track down the devices and perform

718
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,520
investigative investigative and

719
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,080
remediation actions

720
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,840
using that same model again working at

721
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,240
that speed that was really critical

722
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,919
working with intelligence organizations

723
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,039
to reach back to the intelligence

724
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:51,840
community to find

725
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,159
the greater contextual evidence for what

726
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,200
else to look for

727
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,480
that was very very critical so

728
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,320
i think to that piece for this specific

729
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,679
example understanding the clear

730
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:02,799
commander's intent is probably the

731
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:03,760
biggest thing

732
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,440
because this system was a critical

733
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,640
system that was important for the air

734
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,520
force

735
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
we all were on the same page with that i

736
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,520
would like to note here that one of the

737
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,880
local stocks

738
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,240
kind of when i mentioned maturity levels

739
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,320
this was a nascent cyber security unit

740
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,679
they didn't have a lot of technical

741
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,360
training and we're not up to

742
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,880
par as far as where they were but

743
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,080
nonetheless they're still able to help

744
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,679
out again being that local sock

745
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:24,799
having that intimate knowledge of the

746
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,960
environment really helped us at the

747
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,840
enterprise level solve our problem

748
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,760
so as far as the limits of mission

749
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,080
command go i will say

750
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,840
mission command as a command and control

751
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,600
framework for how you organize your

752
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
your units requires a lot of work up

753
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,039
front in terms of getting everyone on

754
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,720
the same page with the ideas of

755
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,880
centralized intent and exercising and

756
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,640
discipline initiative

757
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,400
these are probably of the the five

758
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,679
tenants to master

759
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,039
these are the most difficult since it

760
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,440
requires affecting the multitude of

761
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,840
organizations that fall under your

762
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,000
enterprise

763
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,360
i know this presentation didn't address

764
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,960
too much of the technology piece of it

765
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,480
you know when we're talking about

766
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,440
shared consciousness shared

767
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,880
understanding technology can definitely

768
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,080
help with that

769
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,320
by being able to spread information more

770
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,360
quickly

771
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,720
but it's still you still have to

772
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,080
regardless of whatever technology you

773
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,480
use

774
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,600
you'll still have to influence the

775
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,440
people on the teams there was a good

776
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,360
talk yesterday by

777
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,799
the people from multiple istax in the

778
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,559
united states that talked about how they

779
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,280
were using

780
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,120
i think miss was the platform to share

781
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,320
um iocs

782
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,240
however even if that platform does exist

783
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,360
a lot of organizations were not

784
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,360
necessarily sharing information

785
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,120
so just because they they didn't

786
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,240
necessarily want to again so you still

787
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,360
have to influence

788
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,240
the people in that regard as far as

789
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,280
where the air force is going with this

790
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:37,760
model

791
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,679
um it's to some degree baked into our

792
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,880
organizational procedures

793
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,240
um there are some current efforts to

794
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,760
consolidate different organizations that

795
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,440
way you have less total organizations

796
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,799
that have to participate

797
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,000
um which would help when you're trying

798
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,919
to work at scale

799
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,159
either way at the truly enterprise level

800
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,840
at our level we're having

801
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,760
thousands of endpoints um and hundreds

802
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,039
of different organizations

803
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,039
standardization across maturity level

804
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,640
technologies terrain

805
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
um as the adversary gets faster will

806
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,400
will not necessarily help

807
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
but i think having a good model for how

808
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,799
you operate that's not constrictive

809
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,840
but isn't too loose either

810
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,039
that can accept this sort of fog and

811
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,360
friction will best maximize the defense

812
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,720
of your network from an organizational

813
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,280
perspective

814
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,919
so with that that's my presentation i'm

815
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,960
opening any questions at this point

816
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,440
okay thank you nicholas uh we have two

817
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,240
questions

818
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,840
the first one is do you have any

819
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,919
thoughts on stock overlap

820
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,400
with other branches in the dod

821
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,559
yeah so i know at least for the air

822
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,640
force um

823
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,120
i would say that that concept of mission

824
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,000
command and working with

825
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,480
other organizations in the dod that's a

826
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,240
bit stove-hyped right now

827
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,520
usually we have to work through higher

828
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
headquarters for the air force um before

829
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,559
it works through

830
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,960
uh with other services at this point um

831
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,080
there there are some

832
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,400
efforts to unify that um but those are

833
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,520
still in the works i would say

834
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,960
okay another question what potential

835
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,240
problems do you see

836
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,640
with utilizing mission command as a

837
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,760
framework

838
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,159
to conduct cyber security operations

839
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,320
that other command and control models

840
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,600
would sufficiently address right so with

841
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,520
mission command um you're

842
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,480
you're under the assumption that

843
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,919
everyone's on the same page so besides

844
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,600
the work you have to put up front

845
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,440
um in terms of getting on the same page

846
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,640
and executing

847
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,400
um there is a lot of information that

848
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,840
will come through in mission command so

849
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,600
the task for the person in charge of

850
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,080
everything the task force commander um

851
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,279
they're gonna have a lot of information

852
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,240
overload

853
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,320
um i think the model of having

854
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,360
centralized intent

855
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,200
and centralized execution where

856
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,039
information really only flows

857
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,520
upward and downward that can be helpful

858
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,960
um with that however

859
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,400
you have the issue of um

860
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,120
of tough speed right so if you can

861
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,960
better consolidate the organizations

862
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,919
that you have

863
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,200
under you to have less a less number of

864
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,559
organizations that can help

865
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,240
so with that model with centralized

866
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,760
intent and centralized execution can

867
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,520
help

868
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,720
okay another question you mentioned

869
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,320
a little bit training while doing

870
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,080
training or exercises do you

871
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,520
try to overload the various stakeholders

872
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:17,840
with

873
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,039
a huge amount of information to see how

874
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,559
it works how the model works

875
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,159
i'm sorry would you mind repeating the

876
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,919
question i didn't understand

877
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,919
i mean you spoke a little bit about

878
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,320
training and exercises

879
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,760
so during these exercises do you uh

880
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,279
uh pouring a lot of information and uh

881
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,480
and i don't know if it's to the to the

882
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,960
teams

883
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,279
to see how it works and are you trying

884
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,159
to push the model to the limits

885
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,200
yeah so with these exercises they're

886
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,240
they're like you said there's a lot of

887
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,840
information going on as far as

888
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,360
pushing the model to its limits i i

889
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,200
definitely think um

890
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,400
we need to take an approach where we're

891
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,919
addressing a lot these organizations as

892
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:00,799
a whole

893
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,200
again getting everyone in the air force

894
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,919
those hundreds of different

895
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,000
organizations on the same page

896
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,360
i think the air force there are some

897
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,200
current efforts to really expand it

898
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,080
outward

899
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,440
to a lot of the cyber security

900
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,720
organizations out there but it's still

901
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,679
pretty nascent i would say

902
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,440
thank you before we no longer have any

903
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,000
questions

904
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,760
so let me thank you

905
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,720
for this presentation this was of great

906
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,679
interest

907
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,440
and thank you to all of you virtual

908

attendees especially for those who ask

909
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,559
questions

910
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,600
we now have a break so uh let's uh

911
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,039
we continue together around uh well in

912
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,120
something like 30 minutes

913
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:53,760
thank you nicholas goodbye thank you all
