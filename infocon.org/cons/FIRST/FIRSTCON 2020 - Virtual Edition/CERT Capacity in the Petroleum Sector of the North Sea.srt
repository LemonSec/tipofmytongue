00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,040
working just a moment

51
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,479

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,160
um yes and also

53
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,760

first conference

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,319
which is one of my favorite conferences

58
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:22,879
i really

59
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,040
think the first community of incident

60
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,599
responders is amazing

61
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,680
this is actually the fifth time i'm

62
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,599
presenting at the first conference so

63
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,200
it's a pleasure to be here

64
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
today i'm going to talk about the search

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,040
capacity in the petroleum sector of

66
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,879
north sea

67
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,560
so this presentation is based on

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,400
a study that i was involved in

69
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,760
doing in my previous role

70
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,920
the study addressed the search capacity

71
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,200
among various actors in the industry

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,840
in the petroleum industry in handling

73
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,040
critical ict

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,120
security incidents in industrial control

75
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,720
and safety systems

76
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,959
with a focus on operational technology

77
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,000
so-called ot

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,680
systems and this report as you see

79
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,040
is uh freely available in norwegian

80
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,400
i'm still also going to show you an

81
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,840
english version for those of you who

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
don't speak

83
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,920
norwegian so it was conducted

84
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,040
by sintef on behalf of the norwegian

85
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,560
petroleum safety authority and

86
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,040
when we started this study we contacted

87
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,680
a lot of

88
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,560
different subject area experts and we

89
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,720
did the in-depth interview

90
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
interviews for them uh introduced

91
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,360
lasting up to two hours i think

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,239
and it was a really it was like a

93
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,239
semi-structured interview guide uh

94
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,640
which means that they introduce subjects

95
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
they

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,239
have been given a guideline but uh some

97
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,360
questions were added

98
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,519
during the interview so we sort of went

99
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,879
in that direction where they

100
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,599
there the interview subject had their

101
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,799
expertise

102
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,599
so when we started study and since i've

103
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,640
been

104
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,519
part of this third community for a while

105
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,599
i also contacted

106
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,080
a lot of my friends and colleagues in

107
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,920
in this area and we also got to

108
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,918
interview eight subject area

109
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,918
experts in the search community which

110
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,079
was uh uh

111
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,680
international so we have uh introduced

112
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,960
with the

113
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,000
people working for response teams search

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,960
managers

115
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,080
and yeah all across the industry but we

116
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,720
did not

117
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,800
perform any interviews with the with the

118
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,320
vendors in this

119
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,960
particular study so here's the norwegian

120
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,759
report

121
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,080
that you may read if you understand

122
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,120
norwegian

123
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,280
but there's also an english report and

124
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,120
this is uh

125
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,720
a synopsis a as a kind of summary of the

126
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,320
the bigger study which which me and

127
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,360
some of my uh colleagues

128
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,400
uh wrote and got published in

129
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,360
ieee so it's more like an academic paper

130
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,520
a short version of the study

131
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,680
and this you can also you can you can

132
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,919
get the author version of this paper for

133
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,400
free

134
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,680
if you follow this link so that's the

135
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,000
basis of this talk and then i added a

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,120
little bonus uh

137
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,759
material at the end where i'll present a

138
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,199
recent case study

139
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,960
which illustrates uh types of incident

140
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,320
uh responsibility and preparedness for

141
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,840
foreign oil rig platform

142
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,960
so the purpose of this study was to

143
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,880
to provide a snapshot of the current

144
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,560
situation

145
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,000
uh we wanted to know more about how are

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,479
incidents managed in this in this

147
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,840
particular

148
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,440
sector how do the actors collaborate

149
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,560
in managing incidents and what's the

150
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,520
current practice

151
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,319
for information sharing and also we we

152
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,600
got to talk about some of the main

153
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,720
challenges so

154
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,160
this is not um this paper is not a case

155
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,319
study or a systematic survey

156
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,560
it's more like a snapshot of the current

157
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,319
state of affairs

158
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,080
related to how different numbers

159
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,600
perceive their current

160
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,319
third capacity in the sector and how the

161
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,160
different actors experience themselves

162
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,280
and each other

163
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,400
and also to some extent some pathways

164
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,080
for improvement

165
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,800
and when we did um a search for

166
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,600
information

167
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,880
uh on this we did not find a lot of

168
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,319
publications publicly available uh

169
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,479
information on the internet so that was

170
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,840
also i mean why

171
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,120
uh the petroleum authority uh

172
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,080
commissioned this the study to to gain

173
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
this knowledge

174
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,680
i'm not going to go into all the details

175
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,440
there but i'll provide you some

176
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,720
highlights

177
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,680
um the first thing i want to highlight

178
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,000
is

179
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,720
uh one thing you you might have heard

180
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,680
about before

181
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,960
but there's like a common uh

182
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,360
thing uh that this is something that

183
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,880
came up in a lot of the different

184
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
interviews that we performed

185
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,680
it was the lack of visibility and lack

186
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,720
of

187
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,520
ways of having a good view into what

188
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,599
actually is going on in the ot

189
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,720
systems not only the itty systems where

190
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,319
you have a lot of traditional

191
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,919
you know processes and

192
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,680
and tools already so first of all

193
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,880
there was identified a need for better

194
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,160
asset management

195
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,880
better visibility to all of the ot

196
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,599
things

197
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,000
also from an iot perspective so we did

198
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,960
interview people

199
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,240
that were both working on the i.t

200
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,599
sector in the in the petroleum uh sector

201
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,240
and also on the ot

202
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,840
part and and in some cases those had

203
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,720
some varying views on on the state of

204
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,360
the art

205
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,240
and and what they needed more

206
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,000
information about

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,680
um but it was a very common uh common

208
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,759
uh complaint and also

209
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,000
for those that were carrying out

210
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,560
monitoring of to look for

211
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,280
cyber security incidents they saw there

212
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,720
was a

213
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,479
challenge with lack of technical

214
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,759
information on ot

215
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,120
systems and because how does

216
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,840
baseline traffic really look like there

217
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,879
are you know

218
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,000
some great standards that you can follow

219
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,399
specifications about how communication

220
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,599
protocols look

221
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,559
should look like but then it's not

222
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,000
always the case

223
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,039
that the vendor implements it exactly as

224
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,640
according to the standard so when you

225
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,560
actually start looking into the traffic

226
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,440
it might not look as you expect it to

227
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,680
and this might you know

228
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,640
be the be the case of misunderstandings

229
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:52,959
and

230
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,040
and some some informants mentioned that

231
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,959
when they put monitoring systems in

232
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,680
place sometimes you know the detected

233
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,640
animal

234
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,600
anomalies that aren't really anomalous

235
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,720
but we're just

236
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,600
the things that were usual on in the

237
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,440
baseline traffic

238
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,640
and in order to you know filter out

239
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,080
the noise and and get the tuning right

240
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,680
you need to have all the details of the

241
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,440
communication protocols

242
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,440
and their implementation is also needed

243
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,560
so this is a challenge that also needs

244
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,920
you know some

245
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,880
some actions from the vendors and more

246
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,519
openness

247
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,560
more more information about how

248
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,600
how the different products

249
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,800
actually are implemented

250
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,920
and it came up as an issue

251
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,480
that the cyber security expertise of the

252
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,320
suppliers

253
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,440
might sometimes not be you know

254
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,120
i mean there's there's not a lot of

255
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,200
people that are

256
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,240
uh you know highly experienced and have

257
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,640
a

258
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,640
deep understanding in cyber security in

259
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,279
industrial control systems and also

260
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,959
incident response

261
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,320
so we're sort of talking to a small

262
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,600
community here

263
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,760
and of course you can't expect that all

264
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,720
the vendors have

265
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,120
you know all the necessary skills

266
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,440
in-house to be able to deal with

267
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,079
complicated uh cyber security uh

268
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,519
requests from

269
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,959
from their customers uh this is a direct

270
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,880
quote and i'll translate it to english

271
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,600
from the report that i want to highlight

272
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,200
so this is one of the

273
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,920
interview subjects saying that we are

274
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,760
starting to create a document to send to

275
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,600
our vendors of ics systems

276
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
this helps us separate the cyber

277
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,040
security from getting muddled with other

278
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,920
parts

279
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,360
and this is to put pressure on

280
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,200
manufacturers to focus more on cyber

281
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,920
security

282
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,720
via procurement we want this to be a

283
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,240
standard and not something that each

284
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,720
individual contractor looks into

285
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,440
so i think this is a great point i mean

286
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,760
via procurement we can

287
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,160
see a lot of change coming in in this

288
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,040
area

289
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,120
so when you uh

290
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,760
when new systems are you know purchased

291
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,480
uh

292
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,760
there's a great opportunity to to

293
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,800
do something about the requirements to

294
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,120
cyber security in the procurement

295
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,240
process

296
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,480
and also this is something where the

297
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,279
different actors can collaborate more

298
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,240
in order to create such a a common

299
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,040
standard for

300
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,560
what's the expected level of

301
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,079
cybersecurity in

302
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,240
oil and gas in the petroleum sector

303
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,360
and then i also want to highlight uh

304
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,200
information sharing because this is you

305
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,120
know something an instant response that

306
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,920
i'm

307
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,800
very passionate about and there there

308
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,160
were some issues

309
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,760
that was uh revealed in the study

310
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,680
so one of the things that came up was

311
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,760
that there were some meeting places but

312
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
sometimes they were based on personal

313
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,839
relationships which might be uh

314
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,760
problematic

315
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,519
the larger players that we introduced

316
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,519
they had good contact with international

317
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,440
communities

318
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,240
however the smaller ones they appeared

319
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,079
to rely on their security service

320
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,279
providers

321
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,200
to get you know the information the

322
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,040
required informations about cyber

323
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,079
security threat

324
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,959
landscape and so on and also indicators

325
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,519
to compromise sharing

326
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,200
and also we discovered that the

327
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,440
dedicated tools that are available for

328
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,079
information sharing they are not widely

329
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,680
used

330
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,519
and there were some sharing of

331
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,320
indicators compromised but this

332
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,240
information sharing was mainly focused

333
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,760
on i.t systems and not on ot systems

334
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,800
so that was one gap that we

335
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,000
that we discovered and also something

336
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,560
that

337
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,360
actually came up uh several times was

338
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,240
the problem with

339
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,440
information overload where the

340
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,600
threat information feeds they are not

341
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,720
really

342
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,279
well tailored to the kinds of systems

343
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,639
that

344
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,120
these interview subjects were dealing

345
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,240
with

346
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,279
so for them

347
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,160
they needed some some some tools and

348
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,760
processes to help them with

349
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,480
singing out the information that was

350
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,440
relevant for them

351
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,480
and their systems and also

352
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
uh when we asked about the information

353
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,519
sharing where they

354
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,519
came to active instance

355
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,560
no one actually brought this up it was

356
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,040
only

357
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,720
the informants that we talked to in the

358
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,880
cert international search community that

359
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,839
talked about this

360
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,279
so it seems like the actors

361
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,399
weren't really thinking about

362
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,639
how they could you know buy sharing

363
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,079
information

364
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,600
uh help everyone to to become better

365
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,360
defenders

366
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,519
and one more thing that i want to

367
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,279
highlight and that was also one of the

368
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,959
things that the

369
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,680
petroleum safety authority wanted us to

370
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,240
look into was the

371
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,199
way that search alerts and warnings were

372
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,720
put into

373
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,000
the the processes internal processors

374
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,360
and operationalized and there was a

375
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
great variety among the actors

376
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,760
to what extent they had operationalized

377
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,680
their cert alerts in their internal

378
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,760
processes and

379
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,839
uh some informants that we talked to

380
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:32,800
they have

381
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,720
had never received a certain

382
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,320
communication they

383
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,360
didn't know what the search

384
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,839
communication typically would look like

385
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,120
and some had also never heard about tlp

386
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,440
so this was something that typically

387
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,279
maybe stopped at their i.t

388
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,199
team and never reached the people

389
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,519
working with the security of

390
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,480
ot systems

391
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,160
when we talked when we asked about tools

392
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,079
mist was actually mentioned several

393
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,240
times as a useful platform

394
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,360
by several actors

395
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,519
but there were few processes a few

396
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,120
companies that had processes for

397
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,519
collecting iocs from their own incidents

398
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,519
and sharing them with other actors as i

399
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,920
mentioned

400
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,639
we also brought up the idea of having an

401
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,199
oil

402
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,560
surge or an oil issac in in

403
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,760
norway and most of the

404
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,480
informants that they welcomed the idea

405
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,160
of having an

406
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,199
isac for information sharing uh

407
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,279
there were some mixed opinions about

408
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,040
whether or not they needed

409
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,079
another response

410
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,720
community uh particularly for their

411
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,759
sector

412
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,560
and there were concerns about you know

413
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,199
uh

414
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,120
getting enough people with the enough

415
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,000
competence to staff such a center

416
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,880
but the need of a meeting place and a

417
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
way of sharing information

418
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,639
in an isac was welcomed

419
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,600
so what was the uh conclusion of the

420
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,519
current search capacity

421
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,560
so this is uh sort of

422
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,399
the the the high high level conclusion

423
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,240
is that the informants are relatively

424
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
satisfied with their own search capacity

425
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,199
today

426
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,959
but it's acknowledged that one can

427
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,680
always improve for example invisibility

428
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,360
and in the real-time monitoring of cyber

429
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,519
security and autism

430
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,680
as mentioned there are some special

431
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,000
challenges that came up

432
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,959
that should be looked further into

433
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,199
one thing was the the awareness

434
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,320
in of cyber security in governance and

435
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,079
management level

436
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,839
which many brought up and i mean

437
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,440
the common theme here here is that as

438
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,680
long as there is not a big incident that

439
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,759
has happened and that we can see can

440
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,440
create a lot of damage

441
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,839
uh we don't really get the management

442
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:58,959
and governance to

443
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,639
to to give us the necessary

444
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,839
budget and funding for this since this

445
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,760
third study has been carried out

446
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,439
however there was one big case in norway

447
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,319
which maybe some of you or many of you

448
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:14,880
remember

449
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,559
it was the nosquidro a ransomware

450
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,919
incident which created you know

451
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,119
a big big cyber security incident a lot

452
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,400
of dom time

453
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,160
big huge costs in in recovery

454
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,039
and this i think is something that has

455
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,919
created more awareness in this sector

456
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,799
and also another special challenge is

457
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,520
the

458
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,200
focus on systematic information sharing

459
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,000
more also international collaboration

460
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,280
was brought up

461
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,520
uh in terms of information sharing in

462
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,480
terms of

463
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,600
uh the um problem when

464
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,640
you know you have a big multi-uh

465
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,760
yeah a big international uh corporation

466
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,960
and uh you have uh you know maybe

467
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,080
one third team in in one country

468
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,000
uh another uh daughter company in a

469
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,280
different country and there's an

470
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,320
incident

471
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,480
and do you share that information with

472
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,520
your local

473
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,080
search national cert or do you share it

474
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,039
with the

475
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,440
the national cert where the main office

476
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,559
is

477
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,240
this is something that came up and also

478
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,200
the need for coordinating harmonizing

479
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,960
cyber security in ite and ot systems

480
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,960
and of course something that also

481
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,160
is you know important areas

482
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,600
we need some practical procedures for

483
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,080
incident response preparedness because

484
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,640
um

485
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,520
many informants they perceive that when

486
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,600
when security breaches are detected it

487
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,960
may not be possible to

488
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,000
even to disconnect or shut down auto

489
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,640
systems

490
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
in the containment phase of the incident

491
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,760
response

492
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,840
for instance to perform emergency

493
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,000
security updates

494
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,640
so i wanted to hold on hold on to that

495
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,600
thought

496
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,799
and now i'll

497
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,559
move on to presenting a case study

498
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,440
use case on what instant preparedness in

499
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,320
this condition

500
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,799
could really mean in practice so there

501
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,880
was a customer

502
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,400
that contacted us and gave us a

503
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,799
challenge they had an offshore rig

504
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,640
that was due to an upgrade of their

505
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,840
existing safety and automation system

506
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,320
and they wanted a mnemonic to help them

507
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,280
looking into what

508
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,960
more security features that could build

509
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,440
into this because most offshore

510
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,120
installations they are purchased from a

511
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,200
vendor and it comes with

512
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,840
five to some more years of warranty

513
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,440
where the vendor is responsible for the

514
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,400
system

515
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,480
during this time period it's very hard

516
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,679
to come dragging with

517
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,840
new components for security and ask to

518
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,039
have this installed into the

519
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,480
configuration

520
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,720
so unless you have done your work during

521
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,760
procurement

522
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,120
you are sort of stuck with having to

523
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,880
deal with system as it is during this

524
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,039
warranty period in many cases

525
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,440
but in this case the customer's warranty

526
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,799
period was over

527
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,799
so the memonic team was able to go in

528
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,799
and build some security and incident

529
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,159
preparedness into this installation

530
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,200
in the form of a big red button

531
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,360
so the case study was building a big red

532
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,240
button

533
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,960
to build a solution enabling offshore

534
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,400
personal to control

535
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,320
remote access into the safety and

536
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,240
automation system

537
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,080
so the norwegian petroleum safety

538
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,480
authority they noted in 2018 that the

539
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,559
the industry was becoming increasingly

540
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,559
dependent on digital systems along the

541
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,000
entire value chain

542
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,600
and has since then launched several

543
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,200
projects that has focused on digital

544
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
technology and cyber security

545
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,039
and their effect on health safety

546
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,720
environment risk

547
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,799
the ongoing digitalization of offshore

548
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,400
installations involves the introduction

549
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,559
of new technologies and tools to

550
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,559
replace streamline and automate

551
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,480
expensive manual and physical tasks

552
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,679
offshore

553
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,679
and integrated operations have been

554
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,480
around since maybe 2005

555
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,120
or earlier it allows for a greater

556
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,559
degree of remote control

557
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,880
automation collaboration between on and

558
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,320
offshore personnel

559
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,240
as well as allowing for remote access to

560
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,440
different subsystems

561
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,000
offshore in an orderly manner so the

562
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,880
trends of

563
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,159
integrated operations and digital

564
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:25,200
assistant offshore

565
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
uh provides great benefits and

566
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,039
challenges for the well established

567
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,880
health safety environment regime and

568
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,440
offshore

569
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,960
installations by allowing onshore

570
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
operators to perform tasks on an

571
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,760
offshore

572
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,000
system operators can save money time

573
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
compared to shipping personnel offshore

574
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,640
for minor tasks on critical systems like

575
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,440
for instance

576
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,280
uh doing a small adjustment of the

577
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,240
firewall to

578
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,440
disconnect remote connections in case

579
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,720
you want to you know

580
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,440
segregate the network in an in part of

581
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,400
an incident

582
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,400
response so um

583
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,600
the hse thinking is very engrained into

584
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,440
offshore personnel

585
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,919
and but this collides somewhat with the

586
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,919
idea of someone accessing safety

587
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,559
critical system from a remote location

588
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,559
so also during an emergency involving

589
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,840
iot systems such as

590
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,240
ransomware spreading there is a need to

591
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,320
safely remove this remote access and to

592
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
separate the critical auto systems from

593
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,559
the remotely accessible network

594
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,320
so this became our challenge built a

595
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,080
solution for controlling the access to

596
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,039
the critical

597
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,360
sus system offshore that can be operated

598
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,039
by offshore personnel

599
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,840
that had little to no in-depth security

600
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,080
knowledge

601
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,080
so this visio drawing was what the

602
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,520
memoir team was met with

603
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,120
and the starting point for the

604
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,559
implementation

605
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,600
so in this figure the uh system vendor

606
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,400
topology is anonymized and the levels

607
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,080
that are indicated here are comparable

608
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,840
to the zones in the

609
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,039
iec 62 443 that

610
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,720
if you're working in ics you know this

611
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,960
this framework and if you are

612
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,400
technically inclined you're probably

613
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,960
diving into this drawing right now

614
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,360
and first thing you might see is a lot

615
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
of dual homing

616
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,679
and without bastion hosts which is

617
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,360
apparently still a thing

618
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,600
so all system air systems are

619
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,440
interconnected with the different levels

620
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,159
onbridge

621
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,840
networks and there's also a

622
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,600
vendor-specific network redundancy

623
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,799
protocol running

624
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,200
on the operating system that allows for

625
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,360
lossless failover between the amb

626
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,880
networks

627
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,039
there was a firewall that was the vendor

628
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,240
delivered

629
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,919
that our team got to take a more

630
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,080
thorough look at and it turned out to be

631
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,840
mainly an address translation device

632
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,480
with some

633
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,720
access list inbound filtering and very

634
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,799
little outbound fifth ring

635
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,720
and the packet filter had a very static

636
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,320
and quite open rule based

637
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,360
and there were no logging or audit files

638
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,080
also all systems are joined to one

639
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,279
domain

640
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,840
so we have a standard active directory

641
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,520
domain that all systems are connected to

642
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
cool so from a cyber security

643
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,919
perspective uh this architecture is

644
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,679
perfect for potential tract actors

645
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,919
lateral movements right

646
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,600
but it turns out this is a very standard

647
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
type of topology for

648
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,480
installations like this offshore so

649
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,880
our ot security experts they started

650
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,400
questioning some of this network

651
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,600
architecture

652
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,520
there are some outbound sessions that

653
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,799
must be allowed but

654
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,799
maybe not all of this dual homing is

655
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,919
necessary

656
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,600
so we started looking into the

657
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,919
it-related parts of this

658
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,159
system first because we really didn't

659
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:36,960
want to break

660
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,880
any of the control system features

661
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,679
so the starting point was to look at the

662
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,600
systems that were dueled home both into

663
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,279
the process control network and the

664
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,360
remote access network

665
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,600
of course the remote access network on

666
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,200
an offshore installation is really

667
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,159
secure

668
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,760
you have to jump through quite a few

669
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,360
hoops in order to get there

670
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,279
but still we thought that this could be

671
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,640
done better

672
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,799
so we started by identifying components

673
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,559
that could be removed from the remote

674
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,400
accessible networks

675
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,159
performing an old school's sounds and

676
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,400
conduit analysis

677
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,000
we figured that for the domain

678
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,679
controllers there was really no need for

679
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,480
them to be

680
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,039
remotely accessible and the same went

681
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,159
for several of the

682
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,880
supporting servers so after discussing

683
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,559
this with the vendor we were allowed to

684
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,400
remove several of these from the remote

685
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,360
access network

686
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,880
and after breaking these connections

687
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,640
most of the critical systems for the

688
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,720
process control network only resides

689
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,760
on the process control network

690
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,679
uh there are still some challenges uh

691
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,600
there were some open connections that

692
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,520
are necessary so there

693
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,840
you cannot really have any air gaps

694
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,279
we have three minutes left um

695
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,880
yeah yeah yeah i'm almost at the closing

696
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,520
here

697
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,039
yep so we we had to address some

698
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,200
security controls that could not affect

699
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,039
any control functions

700
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,600
so yeah so after some time we ended up

701
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,960
with removing all the northbound

702
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,840
connections

703
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,919
from the domain controllers and several

704
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,440
supporting systems

705
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,279
so this is the the segregated

706
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,320
network and

707
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,480
this uh we decided that then to build

708
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,919
some extra protections for

709
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,080
for the system that still needed to have

710
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,919
some remote access

711
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,400
and the protection layer is a firewall

712
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,000
between those systems that need to be

713
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,679
remotely accessible

714
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,679
and the rest of the control systems are

715
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,760
then beyond this firewall

716
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
so this was implemented on layer 2 with

717
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,840
layer filtering clustered configuration

718
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,960
with thread detection

719
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,720
jet prevention capabilities and so on

720
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
and also this gave us the opportunity of

721
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,640
getting actually some logs

722
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,760
uh created and then exported to the sock

723
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,360
for analysis

724
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,799
so there's a great you know improvement

725
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,679
of security by adding this firewall

726
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,600
so this is the result that we ended up

727
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,799
in the in the

728
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,360
with in the end so i know the only

729
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,200
challenge that remained was to empower

730
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,600
the operators to change the access in

731
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,559
in case there was an incident so how did

732
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,039
this

733
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,240
uh this uh this happen

734
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,279
we looked in the api of the firewall

735
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,559
and we made this

736
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,039
these three different uh firewall

737
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:21,840
policies

738
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
so you have three options and it's

739
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,399
really easy to change between them

740
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,760
and you just do this by touching uh

741
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,240
this touch panel so this is the actual

742
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
red button how it looks like it was

743
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,840
implemented on touch screen that was

744
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,520
installed in the cabinet on the

745
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,559
oil platform where operators with no or

746
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,240
little training could easily

747
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,799
you know change the firewall policy

748
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,159
okay so the takeaways is that

749
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,159
you know a personalization of the search

750
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,679
alerts and learning is still a work in

751
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,960
progress

752
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,679
uh it's feasible to implement battery

753
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,360
operational procedures for securing all

754
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,159
the systems

755
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,080
and when an incident occurs you need to

756
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,240
be prepared to press the red

757
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,399
big red button in a safe manner of

758
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,919
course segregating the

759
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,799
networks so that you can perform

760
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,480
incident procedures

761
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,159
so thank you okay thank you very much

762
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,640
thank you for everybody to participate

763
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,520
in

764
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,039
in this interesting talk we have no

765
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,159
more time left uh for questions and

766
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,520
answers we have

767
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,480
one question and it was answered during

768
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,520
your talk

769
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,240
so thank you very much have a good day

770
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,120
