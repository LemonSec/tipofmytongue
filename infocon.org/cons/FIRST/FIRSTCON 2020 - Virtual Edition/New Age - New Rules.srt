talk today

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,200
so sharif and i are here today to talk a

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit about

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,159
governments and how they see incident

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,920
response specifically

45
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,320
at a very international level when you

46
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,000
think about incident response i think

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,520
many of us on the call

48
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,479
or on the presentation come from a world

49
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:38,880
where

50
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,560
a lot of incident response was purely

51
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,960
technical we reacted to an incident

52
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,200
we worked with a variety of stakeholders

53
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,880
to address those issues

54
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,280
um but overall like we took technical

55
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,960
actions and quite often we were not

56
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,240
really very

57
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,960
very much scrutinized by governments and

58
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
some of our government stakeholders

59
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,119
that has changed in the last few years

60
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,360
with big incidents such as notpetya

61
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,000
stuxnet and triton or crisis what we're

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,680
seeing is that governments have taken a

63
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,560
really really big

64
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,280
interest in what is actually happening

65
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
in the incident response realm

66
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,959
and it's very important for us to

67
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,800
understand that those governments and

68
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,920
those stakeholders

69
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,760
that come more from the policy world

70
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,520
have a very different perspective of

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,480
what we do

72
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,000
than we actually have within our

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,239
community quite often when you talk to

74
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,760
these people you actually hear that they

75
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,599
think of us a little bit as the police

76
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,400
department

77
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,920
because when someone does a forensic

78
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,160
investigation that's typically a police

79
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,879
officer

80
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,560
so that's often something that comes to

81
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
mind and in this talk today

82
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,920
we'll share with you a little bit about

83
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,519
how governments have been thinking and

84
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,640
organizing

85
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,959
what first and other organizations are

86
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,480
doing to provide input

87
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,560
and also maybe a little bit why we need

88
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,680
to help those

89
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,480
diplomats and policy makers understand

90
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,080
why perhaps the police

91
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,120
isn't the best analogy for a c-cert and

92
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,720
with that i'll hand it off to sharif who

93
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,159
will introduce us to some

94
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,080
of these intra-intergovernmental

95
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,200
processes

96
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,280
that have been taking place in the last

97
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,840
few years

98
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,959
sharif you may be on mute if you're

99
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
speaking

100
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,280
can you hear me now yes hi

101
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,400
thanks martin uh well the united nation

102
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,440
realized uh

103
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,720
in 2004 that that

104
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,040
i mean the immense use of ict across

105
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,560
different

106
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,120
applications across different sectors uh

107
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,360
requires some coordination and the un

108
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,959
general assembly in 2004 established

109
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,599
one of the really important groups that

110
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,440
are quite relevant to our talk today

111
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,480
which is the un

112
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,879
group of governmental experts to examine

113
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,000
the impact of

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
i mean the development of ict on

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,920
international peace

116
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,319
basically there are these are groups of

117
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,000
governmental experts

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
one expert per country initially the

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,439
group started with like

120
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,120
15 countries only so imagine like 15

121
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,920
experts only dealing with this issue i

122
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,120
had the privilege of being

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,238
a part of this group in 2012 2013 i was

124
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,120
the only one

125
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,079
from africa and the middle east actually

126
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,079
so it's about 60 countries and and

127
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,960
and then i mean we lobbied to expand the

128
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,360
group

129
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
we love it to have more inclusion of

130
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,800
non-governmental i mean organizations

131
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,639
i mean professional entities and as such

132
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,080
that group expanded to include now 25

133
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,800
members there were six group of

134
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,600
governmental experts since 2004

135
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,800
however only six three of the six groups

136
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,520
uh

137
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,320
ended up with a consensus on a report

138
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,680
that was

139
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,840
later on adopted by the general assembly

140
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,440
of the united nations the u.n

141
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,960
general assembly is important because

142
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,880
that's where you have membership

143
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,840
of all countries there at equal footage

144
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,360
we also lobbied for

145
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,479
openness in this discussions and as such

146
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,840
uh the un agreed to a recommendation to

147
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,919
establish an open-ended working group

148
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,840
where we invite

149
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,880
non-governmental uh representatives

150
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,000
first was invited to the launching event

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,039
i had the privilege and martin uh also i

152
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,360
had the privilege to address uh the

153
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,120
group in different capacities

154
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,360
uh uh i think this is very important to

155
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,320
continue

156
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,840
i would like to emphasize here that the

157
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,160
unge

158
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,280
falls under the un uh first committee

159
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,639
which is the main committee of the

160
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,680
general assembly

161
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,360
and as such it's very important to

162
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,800
engage with them

163
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,759
this is really a highway to reach the un

164
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,639
at the

165
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,919
highest possible level um when it comes

166
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,120
to

167
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,039
the two groups i need to emphasize

168
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,639
really the membership and that would

169
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,280
reflect on the type of work that

170
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,600
is being done at this point now we have

171
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,960
a ungge group

172
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,039
a group of governmental experts that

173
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,440
started off in

174
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,319
2019 and the mandate

175
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,479
is to produce a report based again

176
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,800
hopefully on consensus

177
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,319
by 2021 the group focus on norms

178
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,120
rules and principles for building

179
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,919
confidence

180
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,759
and confidence building measures and

181
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,440
capacity building

182
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,880
at large while the open-ended working

183
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,440
group

184
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,240
which is chaired by the swiss diplomat

185
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,880
uh

186
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,600
it has more membership ngos are there

187
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,120
businesses are there academia and of

188
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
course government is there also

189
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,319
and they started off in 2019 the mandate

190
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,960
was to develop a report by 2020 by

191
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,400
but due to the covet uh pandemic

192
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,720
that was extended to 2021

193
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,440
i encourage all members of first to

194
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,520
really engage with the representatives

195
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,000
whether

196
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,560
at the country level like uh what we

197
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,440
lobbied for

198
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,720
uh with the ungge uh situation

199
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,759
uh uh because that's i mean the highway

200
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,240
really

201
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,360
to the un assembly as i mentioned before

202
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,800
and that's how we can have more uh

203
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,000
really hands-on uh experience especially

204
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,960
from this from first being a forum for

205
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,840
instance

206
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,160
response and security teams people who

207
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,960
are uh

208
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,280
first responders people who really know

209
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,639
about

210
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,880
how to handle incidents and how to deal

211
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,479
with escalations

212
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,680
with diplomats i remember in my earlier

213
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,520
experience with the ungge

214
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,039
i was the only non-diplomat among 15

215
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,599
experts and you see the discussions

216
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,360
there i mean many of the diplomats

217
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,560
wanted to use

218
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,720
articles that were used for weapons of

219
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,840
mass destruction in nuclear and chemical

220
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,720
cases and and of course some of these uh

221
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
uh discussions are not relevant when it

222
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,520
comes to

223
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,120
uh cyber security uh or uh dealing with

224
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,080
instance uh cyber incidents uh uh

225
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,840
specifically there are two issues that

226
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,800
i'd like to

227
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,680
raise uh i mean awareness of discussions

228
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,080
about attribution how to relate

229
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,400
uh really a certain incident to uh

230
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,680
certain actors

231
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,120
whether they are state actors or

232
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,520
non-state actors uh i mean in a

233
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,039
traditional

234
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,039
attack with i mean traditional weapons

235
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,640
it is easier to do the investigation

236
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,799
as opposed to in cyber space where you

237
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,159
have you know

238
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,039
proxies and you have really ways of

239
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,000
spoofing addresses

240
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,559
and so on and so forth so having some

241
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,440
liability

242
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,480
articles there without proper other

243
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,640
properly addressing attribution could be

244
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,080
dangerous and again this is

245
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,240
an area where uh i mean instant

246
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,200
responders

247
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,160
can help educate decision makers and

248
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,760
their countries and their

249
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,560
agencies uh and hopefully representative

250
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:00,959
in

251
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,920
both groups of of this situation another

252
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,399
point

253
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,600
that could have reflected negatively on

254
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,000
really

255
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,720
some of the articles is the concept of

256
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,920
or the interpretation of the concept of

257
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,959
proportionality when it comes to uh

258
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,120
really retaliation or really a state

259
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,480
taking measures against an attack in in

260
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,760
a cyber space an attack can

261
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,720
really escalate because of

262
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,200
interdependencies

263
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,959
an attack on infrastructure can affect

264
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,800
hospitals can affect banks can

265
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,560
affect individuals in different

266
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,640
capacities so again

267
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,040
we need to educate decision makers again

268
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,680
when it comes to accepting such norms

269
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
that proportionality and

270
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,000
interdependences in the cyber world are

271
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,720
are

272
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
quite different than in the physical

273
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,760
world

274
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,240
another concept that was also discussed

275
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,440
uh uh

276
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,120
several times and still uh really

277
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,920
pops up every now and then is the the

278
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,399
right

279
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,760
to have pre-emptives strikes uh uh

280
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,920
cyber offensive capabilities you'll see

281
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,200
some

282
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,760
voices lobbying for this to happen uh

283
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,959
this is not something

284
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,399
uh that should be taken easily

285
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,839
and definitely uh it would have

286
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,880
an impact on international peace your

287
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,600
role as

288
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,839
instant responders could be really

289
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,680
instrumental in educating decision

290
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,839
makers about the consequences of actions

291
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,200
and reactions

292
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,480
uh in our discussion of norms you know

293
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,279
there are

294
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,200
rules of the highways and

295
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,959
there are legal implications as well as

296
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,000
agreements that are not legally binding

297
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
but they are i mean shared among

298
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,839
stakeholders like norms at this point

299
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,440
cyber norms are discussed

300
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,839
at a level of consensus between

301
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,160
governments and would be a basis for

302
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,200
how we behave in cyber space whether

303
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,160
as individuals as professionals or at

304
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,720
large

305
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,839
or between states this is one step below

306
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,839
having an international treaty when it

307
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,680
comes to

308
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,800
dealing with the cyber security i'll

309
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,880
share quickly with you some norms uh

310
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,959
for those of you who are interested

311
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,640
there are uh we can have

312
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,800
i mean the presentation is there and

313
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,240
there are links that would

314
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,760
guide you to to see where the

315
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,160
discussions are heading the last

316
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,560
i mean the new ngge that came up with a

317
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,200
consensus report was in 2015

318
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,720
and it states uh certain norms uh that

319
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,839
were accepted

320
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,760
by the way this is has been accepted by

321
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,519
the u.n general assembly so this is the

322
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,440
basis for many of the discussions all

323
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,560
going on

324
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,760
right now i mean

325
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,600
you you can agree that they are logical

326
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,800
and the way they are set

327
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,160
uh there i mean it is quite a good basis

328
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,519
of how states should do and should not

329
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,160
do

330
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,519
this it should not engage in harmful uh

331
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,480
acts that would uh threats international

332
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,920
peace and security

333
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,399
uh that uh states should consider all

334
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,320
relevant information and share it

335
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,519
in an open transparent way and shouldn't

336
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,240
encourage

337
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,399
uh illegal actors to use their

338
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,760
infrastructure

339
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,240
again there is a mention of really the

340
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,760
rights to privacy

341
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,760
uh the uh really some measures uh

342
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,279
against attacking critical

343
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,560
infrastructure

344
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,399
and and uh uh

345
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,040
attacking the integrity of supply chain

346
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,000
uh

347
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,800
one norm really is directed to asserts

348
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,519
you'll see

349
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,519
number 11 here about states should not

350
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,120
attack uh i mean emergency response

351
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,560
teams or certain

352
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,079
capabilities this is something that we

353
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,720
negotiated in 2012 2013 so i'm

354
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,800
really pleased to have this and i mean

355
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,920
inside because

356
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,720
i mean the perception that these certs

357
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,360
are

358
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,959
uh for i mean mostly uh for civilian

359
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,000
uh support and to protect uh really

360
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,519
a general usage of icts is is very

361
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,639
important

362
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,079
confidence building measures are

363
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,079
important are parallel to the norms

364
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:14,399
where

365
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,079
you have the focus on really

366
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,680
agreeing on a basis to build

367
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,720
confidence ahead of having a crisis

368
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,079
it is not really appropriate really to

369
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,160
try to build new relationships during a

370
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,519
crisis time

371
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,360
probably it's too late however

372
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,120
working on confidence building measures

373
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,720
and i believe first

374
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,959
could be the one of the form that would

375
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,480
help build this

376
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,760
confidence uh among key players uh

377
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,680
establishing points of contacts

378
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,360
establishing uh

379
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,920
support for voluntarily sharing

380
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,800
information

381
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,320
on incidents mechanisms for cooperation

382
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,399
should be set ahead of time

383
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,040
all these norms are confidence building

384
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,959
measures uh rather are

385
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,279
important to strengthen international uh

386
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,480
peace and security

387
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,639
uh certs are in the middle of all this

388
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,440
uh so again i would encourage you

389
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,320
by engaging to uh the two modalities uh

390
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,880
within the u.n whether the open-ended

391
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,920
uh working group or at the governmental

392
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,440
level with the ungge

393
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,360
to emphasize the importance of

394
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
confidence-building measures and to

395
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,560
emphasize the importance of government

396
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,000
supporting this role

397
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,800
and really opening up because i mean the

398
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
work of certs and i have my experience

399
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,480
in my home country egypt

400
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,120
where our cert would collaborate with

401
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,880
certs all around the world to

402
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,320
prevent cyber attacks ddos attacks and

403
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,360
others

404
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,839
and and that is instrumental in the

405
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,480
success

406
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,760
of our mission as incident responders uh

407
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,639
back to you martin

408
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,440
thank you very much sharif so a really

409
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,040
interesting question is how do these

410
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,639
norms actually come to be

411
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,560
is it just someone who makes them up and

412
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
then discusses them or is this something

413
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,279
that actually has

414
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,680
a process attached to it and there's a

415
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,360
definition of norms that's widely

416
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,279
accepted to be the one that most people

417
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,279
use today it comes from a researcher

418
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,760
called katzenstein who in 1996 wrote

419
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,720
that a norm

420
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,639
is a collective expectation for the

421
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,760
proper behavior

422
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,560
of actors with a given identity so for

423
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,120
instance

424
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,839
things that we expect states to do it

425
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,839
might not always be described but if we

426
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,199
expect them to do it

427
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,279
that is often a norm or an indication

428
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,880
that we expect that's

429
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,800
the states to adhere to a particular

430
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,600
norm they're often identified by people

431
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,800
that perceive a need

432
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,560
or when they are contested and i'll

433
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,320
actually use an example of that

434
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,279
so for instance when there was an attack

435
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:43,600
or

436
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,399
a cyber incident at sony pictures

437
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,000
entertainment a few years ago

438
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,079
and it was attributed by several

439
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,079
governments to be initiated by

440
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,399
a state at that point in time there was

441
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,320
a lot of discussion that it would not be

442
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,839
appropriate for a state

443
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,480
to attack a private sector company now

444
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,279
that isn't

445
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,959
necessarily one of the norms that is

446
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,279
currently being discussed at those very

447
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,959
high levels but it was clearly something

448
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:07,519
where

449
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,320
a lot of individuals and organizations

450
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,959
stood up

451
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,560
and engaged in what we call noise

452
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,800
entrepreneurship to make it clear that

453
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,920
this was something that they were not

454
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,560
willing to

455
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,360
accept from states so when you have

456
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,639
norms they come to be

457
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,959
and they grow in a very specific process

458
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,480
that requires some time

459
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,279
they first emerge some individuals start

460
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,800
noticing that something is happening

461
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,240
which they do not agree with

462
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,160
and they start contesting that

463
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,759
particular behavior and saying this

464
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,880
should not happen

465
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,000
and that can be true legal complaints it

466
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,279
can be by

467
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,560
um just activism against that idea

468
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,480
it can be by proposing language that

469
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,839
actually makes clear something like this

470
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,199
shouldn't happen

471
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,199
the next thing is that the idea starts

472
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,880
cascading or not

473
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,519
what that means is that the um idea that

474
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,440
is suggested by a number of different

475
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,959
organizations and people that is

476
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,680
emerging ends up moving to the system

477
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,920
and more and more actors start stating

478
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,600
that they agree or disagree

479
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,439
with that particular norm and finally

480
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,760
as it is widely accepted by different

481
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,640
actors

482
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,199
those actors start internalizing it so

483
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,000
for instance

484
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,160
if a whole group of governments agree

485
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,520
something shouldn't happen

486
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,959
they might start putting together

487
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,119
processes implementations

488
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,359
organizations to make sure that that

489
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,160
specific activity will never take place

490
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,919
next slide sharif so

491
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,080
sharif mentioned two very specific

492
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,320
processes the un group of governmental

493
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,480
experts and the open-ended working group

494
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,240
that are happening at an interstate

495
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,120
level today in the case of the oewg

496
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,360
also involves some other organizations

497
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,200
and even gave an opportunity

498
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,360
for instance the first to provide some

499
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,799
input to that group

500
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,799
but there are also other places where

501
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,160
norms development and norms

502
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,080
entrepreneurship takes place

503
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,760
and in the next slide i'll show you

504
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,120
briefly what

505
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,720
type of organizations have really

506
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,240
engaged in this

507
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,799
next slide thank you so these are three

508
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,280
examples of proposed dorms by three

509
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,400
different bodies

510
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,720
there's the ungge who propose the norm

511
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,679
that states should

512
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,880
never knowingly support activity to harm

513
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,440
sea certs of another state there's a

514
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,039
proposal by the global

515
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,720
community commission on the stability of

516
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,160
cyberspace

517
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,320
which stated that states should not

518
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,520
pursue support

519
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
or allow cyber operations intended to

520
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,679
disrupt technical infrastructure related

521
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,880
to elections

522
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,960
and finally there's a very old proposal

523
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,919
from microsoft

524
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,840
that was actually one of the first real

525
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,679
examples of norms entrepreneurship from

526
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,120
a private sector company

527
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,280
that stated that global ict companies

528
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,559
should issue patches

529
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,960
to protect i.t users regardless of the

530
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,799
attacker and their motives

531
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,880
and we've actually seen development of

532
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,720
these types of norms in many many

533
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,919
different communities

534
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,520
and it's a very interesting space

535
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,000
because i think most people look at the

536
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,720
gge

537
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,559
as sort of the top level normative

538
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,880
organization as in they are proposing

539
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,160
norms that are actually seeing

540
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,520
widespread acceptance

541
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,679
by states which has a lot of influence

542
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,280
there's also a lot of work happening in

543
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,559
these other bodies

544
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,960
and sometimes you see ideas from there

545
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,039
bubbling up and getting more credibility

546
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,400
in other bodies as well

547
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,240
for instance the gcse had a very

548
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,400
interesting norm to protect the public

549
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,080
core of the internet which is one that

550
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,200
is widely looked at

551
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
by many different organizations and

552
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,039
proposed to many different bodies as an

553
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,640
actual

554
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,080
cyber norm moving into the next slide

555
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,760
i wanted to start sharing with you a

556
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,600
little bit of what first has done in

557
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,480
this space

558
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,200
so first as an organization we have a

559
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,760
lot of

560
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,600
incident response teams that are members

561
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,160
of first what was very interesting to us

562
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,520
was a few years ago

563
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,960
we had a couple of talks at the

564
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,600
conference where we actually talked

565
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,000
about that sea cert related norm that i

566
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,280
just showed and that was also on

567
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,559
sharif's slides

568
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,160
in the very beginning of the talk and it

569
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,320
was very interesting to realize that

570
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,520
most c-certs

571
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,120
actually had no idea that that norm

572
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,559
existed

573
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,640
so in order to address this we're doing

574
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,600
two things

575
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,520
first of all we're bringing content from

576
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,600
these organizations to all of you

577
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
as part of the conference as part of

578
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,360
emails as part of a special interest

579
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,039
group that we are launching

580
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,280
and at the same time we're also bringing

581
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,480
content from all of you

582
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,559
and ideas from all of you uh that has

583
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,640
collected truly special interest group

584
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,320
back to these bodies like the united

585
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,559
states so we actually engaged we went to

586
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,360
new york

587
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,120
sharif and i did a lot of work to

588
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,200
provide input to these bodies

589
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,559
and in the next slide we'll talk a

590
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,799
little bit about what that looks like

591
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,600
we have 10 minutes left thank you

592
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,960
graciela

593
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,280
so um what we're really doing is we're

594
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,120
having informal conversations with

595
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,520
individual participants in the ungge

596
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,039
because we don't necessarily have direct

597
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,320
access there

598
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,919
we're formally participating in the

599
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,600
open-ended working group as a civil

600
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,159
society

601
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,000
organization that went to their civil

602
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,760
society meeting to provide

603
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,520
input and finally we also contributed

604
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,840
both directly and as part of feedback

605
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,360
that was actually compiled by other

606
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,480
civil society

607
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
and technical community organizations

608
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,039
directly to these bodies

609
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,360
now the next slide will show you what

610
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,400
our key message

611
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,880
really is and it's very simple it is

612
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,559
that sea certs are not the police

613
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,559
they're more like fire departments

614
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,640
when an incident happens we need to have

615
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,559
the independence the ability to work

616
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:18,960
across

617
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
borders to deal with the incident

618
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,480
effectively and

619
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,159
fire departments do that all the time

620
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,240
like they go to different jurisdictions

621
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,720
to help

622
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,280
other fire departments take out really

623
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
really big fires and that's really

624
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,200
what we want these diplomats to see us

625
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,400
as

626
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,000
and on the next two slides we'll show

627
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,520
you a little bit about the key things

628
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,799
that we're focusing on

629
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,559
the first one is that we want these

630
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,480
organizations and in particular

631
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
the states within the united nations to

632
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,520
emphasize

633
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,600
partnership and inclusion and we want

634
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
them to double down on capacity building

635
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,200
so we want them to focus on

636
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,760
collaboration and enabling different

637
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,880
organizations

638
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,280
not just states and national incident

639
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,400
response teams

640
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,320
but all incident response teams to build

641
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,799
a community

642
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,960
and sharif you um you can speak to the

643
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,080
last two

644
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,720
okay well uh and raising awareness is

645
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,799
key to the success of such efforts

646
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,480
raising awareness at all levels the

647
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,640
community level then i mean

648
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,760
uh at all levels basically

649
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,799
we can impact uh

650
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,000
uh i mean policymakers diplomats i've

651
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,880
given talks

652
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,039
uh and workshops where diplomats are

653
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,880
there decision makers

654
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,000
uh ngos professional talks like what

655
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,320
we're

656
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,880
doing now at first everybody needs to

657
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,760
really share

658
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,640
to be open about norms and and share

659
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,280
about

660
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,679
experiences about their impact and what

661
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,720
really certs

662
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,080
are uniquely positioned uh to do this

663
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,440
is really uh could be an efficient way

664
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,520
of making these norms a reality

665
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,640
not just the statement

666
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,360
thank you and then finally we don't just

667
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:57,760
provide

668
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,400
input on the norms process we also

669
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,440
actually provide some

670
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
input directly on policy that we think

671
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,559
is important

672
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,080
the very first statement that we shared

673
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,760
with these organizations is that we

674
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,440
believe it's very important to adopt

675
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,720
practical measures

676
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,400
to make sure that everyone understands

677
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,640
each other's roles and responsibilities

678
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,640
and we actually used ethics first which

679
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,200
was initiated and developed within first

680
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,960
as an example of an initiative that

681
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,320
actually accomplishes this

682
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,200
for incident responders we also ask

683
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,960
governments to think about how policy

684
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,960
can negatively affect sea certs

685
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,600
for instance when technical expertise is

686
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,919
criminalized or you can't use tools

687
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,840
across borders that makes it very

688
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,320
difficult for us to be successful

689
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,240
third we ask them to think about

690
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,080
allowing sharing of defensive cyber

691
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,440
security information

692
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,080
across borders within first we've seen

693
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,840
quite a bit in the last few years how

694
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,720
sanctions

695
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
and export restrictions have made our

696
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
life a lot more difficult

697
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,039
in fact as first we're spending more and

698
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,480
more money on figuring out

699
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,159
how we can actually allow incident

700
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,320
responders from across the world to

701
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,200
participate

702
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,039
and that's not something that will scale

703
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,120
or work for us because we need to work

704
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,640
at incidents at the speed of the

705
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,279
incident

706
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,200
which is almost always immediate and we

707
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,440
can't take days or weeks to try and get

708
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,320
licenses

709
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,000
to work with another incident response

710
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,360
team and

711
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,760
we also encourage these governments to

712
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,840
look beyond the work that they have done

713
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,279
and look at work that has happened

714
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,880
within the technical community and a

715
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,559
good example here is actually the global

716
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,760
commission on the stability of

717
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,799
cyberspace

718
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,640
and they're norm to protect the public

719
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,080
core of the internet

720
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,679
when there's a norm that you should not

721
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,760
be attacking the certificate authority

722
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,279
or web pki system

723
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,360
that is actually helpful to us because

724
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,720
it makes incidents a lot more

725
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,960
predictable and a lot more isolated

726
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,760
and doesn't create as much um outcome

727
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,360
for the rest of the internet that we're

728
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,799
trying to protect

729
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,559
and then sharif actually came up with

730
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,919
this very last one which i think

731
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,080
summarizes really very very well

732
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,919
what it is that we as a community want

733
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,360
to create

734
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,960
cyber security is a shared

735
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,559
responsibility we

736
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,440
would like to promote this really a

737
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,520
common understanding across different

738
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
stakeholders they need to understand the

739
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,720
roles it is not

740
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,960
a technology or a technical problem

741
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,919
handled by

742
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,080
by the third so ict professionals

743
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,000
otherwise it will become our problem

744
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,080
rather than the global problem or the

745
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,919
government problem of the people problem

746
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:18,640
it is

747
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,919
our shared responsibility to secure uh

748
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,880
cyberspace to make sure that uh i mean

749
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,760
illicit

750
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,440
activities are cornered are investigated

751
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
properly and and as such

752
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,679
they are not the norm what uh martin

753
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,600
just mentioned about export control we

754
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,440
have faced this in in

755
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,760
numerous ways we're developing capacity

756
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,080
in our certain egypt where certain

757
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,440
technologies were limited in terms of uh

758
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,000
exports and and as such criminals have

759
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,799
access

760
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,000
of within the underground uh networks to

761
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,720
such uh really technologies it is the

762
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,640
instant responders that suffer the most

763
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,360
from

764
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,679
regulations that hinder their ability to

765
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,679
get access to the technology

766
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,080
uh uh definitely the civil society the

767
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,799
professional

768
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,880
the the ngos need to be part of this

769
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,720
effort it's a shared responsibility that

770
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,080
need to be understood

771
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,120
and addressed by one now

772
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,200
with this i would like to thank you all

773
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,440
for uh following and maybe we have a few

774
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,120
minutes for questions

775
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,840
okay thank you very much sheriff

776
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,439
martin and we have a

777
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,120
participant that she would like to

778
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,400
she raised her hand and

779
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,240
i think that she would like to

780
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,159
participate so

781
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,200
to ask a question

782
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,289
[Music]

783
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,080
sorry i have to look at her

784
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,520
okay and have to allow her the speaker

785
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,840
to speak

786
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,400
it looked like they had raised the head

787
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
but i have just power cleaned somewhere

788
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,559

794
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
click it this must be some mistake i saw

795
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,159
that

796
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,559
i really didn't have any questions and

797
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,080
so i'm sorry

800
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,279
um

801
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,320
no more question in the uh yes young

802
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,240
mcdonald is talking how re

803
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,880
receptive our organizations being to

804
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,440
first

805
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,279
effort so i can take that one if you

806
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,799
want i think they're actually being very

807
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:53,520
receptive

808
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,440
in a sense that one thing that i always

809
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,039
learn from diplomats is that they're

810
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:57,440
actually

811
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,600
always looking for input from the

812
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,200
technical community and from civil

813
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,399
society and

814
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,080
they have often been challenged by the

815
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,760
fact that they didn't really find people

816
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,120
that were willing to sort of take them

817
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,159
through the problems

818
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,720
and explain them in more detail and i

819
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,240
think people like sharif were actually

820
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,919
the trailblazers like they came into

821
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,000
that community and started sharing uh

822
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,760
things as part of the gge

823
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,919
and now it's really up to all of us to

824
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,600
continue to take on the tone

825
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,840
and actually start taking these

826
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,880
diplomats with us

827
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,960
as we work through technical issues so

828
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,640
overall my perspective is that they're

829
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,159
very very open to it

830
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,159
but we do have to take a step back when

831
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,440
we explain something we can't

832
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,360
immediately dive into the details

833
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,200
we have to kind of start with what we're

834
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,120
trying to achieve and where we're trying

835
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,600
to go

836
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,520
so that's my perspective maybe you have

837
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,640
some other thoughts

838
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,960
yeah it's a learning process for old we

839
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,559
have to realize when we address

840
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,159
like different communities that the

841
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,440
language might be different the

842
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,240
background

843
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,000
i mean we need to understand about their

844
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,760
background my experience being part of

845
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,320
the ungge a group of all diplomats

846
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,480
so the room was full like of diplomats

847
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,760
they are debating things

848
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,760
they have common background however they

849
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,760
were extremely supportive extremely

850
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,480
receptive

851
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,200
and when i mentioned for instance the

852
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,760
first

853
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,399
uh we had a lot of support for such

854
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,919
effort but we need to understand the

855
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,679
language where they are coming from

856
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,520
as i mentioned some of the articles that

857
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,919
they they want to use

858
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,159
need to be adjusted the process of the

859
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,600
open-ended working group was

860
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,840
proposed it took several years for this

861
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,880
to materialize

862
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,679
i've been following the ungge since 2012

863
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,240
so for

864
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,360
eight years the language has changed uh

865
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,039
the open-ended working group has been

866
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,200
established we are lobbying now for

867
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,200
the open-ended working group to continue

868
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,360
in a different formula moving forward

869
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,679
with the support of professionals like

870
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,440
the incident responders here attending

871
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,320
this conference

872
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,960
is very important really for the success

873
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,640
of such efforts

874
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,320
we have one quest one more question and

875
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,039
i'm going to read something that raman

876
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:55,919
jitsin

877
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,520
chima wrote on the chat box as an

878
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,919
organization that participates in the

879
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,120
un cyber processes and the first member

880
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,520
i just wanted to share from access now

881
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,640
how much

882
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,200
we appreciate first trying to do more

883
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,679
here

884
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,640
and how important it is to engage we

885
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,840
have stressed

886
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,320
how engaging first another technical

887
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:18,880
expert

888
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,679
on rinsing the response is key and we

889
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,000
hope

890
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,159
we can do more to help and i'm going to

891
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,559
read the following and the last question

892
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,840
because we

893
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,960
don't have uh unfortunately

894
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,880
unfortunately more time in the und ge

895
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,360
do you see people pushing back against

896
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,120
these common norms that are being

897
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,080
developed

898
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,520
if so can you talk to that as to how you

899
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,320
address their

900
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,640
issues

901
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,880
well my experience with the ungg you

902
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,159
find always like

903
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,080
people bringing in articles that are

904
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,519
related to their background so that

905
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,080
happens

906
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,000
however these norms the ones that i

907
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,600
shared is already agreed upon

908
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,200
they have been accepted by the general

909
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,720
assembly nobody is

910
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,880
i mean really working against them the

911
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,880
the challenge is how to make them

912
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,279
uh practical how to apply them to so

913
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,200
it's the operational aspects of how to

914
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,799
make this norm a reality

915
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,519
and how to make sure for us uh belonging

916
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,080
to this

917
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,120
uh a community a community of t-shirts

918
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,200
part of this process a part of the

919
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,399
solution

920
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,000
and and that really should be our

921
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,799
effort across different disciplines

922
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,760
