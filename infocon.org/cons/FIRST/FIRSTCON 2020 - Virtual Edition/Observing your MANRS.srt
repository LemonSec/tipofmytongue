1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
i'll be moderating this session um we

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,880
ask that you submit your questions for a

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,799
q a in the q a section

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,360
at the bottom the questions will be

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,080
queued in the order received

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,280
so um like to welcome kevin manuel

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,400
he works at the internet society and as

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,480
the manager of technical and operational

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,760
engagement supporting

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,920
the deployment of key internet

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,279
technologies including

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,160
routing security he previously worked

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,480
for

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,320
janet which is the uk enron and giant

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,000
and much was known from there um

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,360
so the talk observing your manners

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,200
um it's about bgp which is uh

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,640
or controlling bgp which is entirely

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,160
based on trust with no built-in

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,360
validation of the

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,640
legitimacy of routing updates this

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,239
causes a lot of problems and there's

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,079
been a growing number of major incidents

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:56,719
the last

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,840
three years so manners the mutually

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,039
assured norms for routing security tries

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,559
to address these problems

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,200
and we're exciting to hear about it go

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,600
ahead

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,880
kevin okay thank you margaret um

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,520
so yeah as mentioned this is about uh

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,880
the manners initiative

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,000
uh but also um talking about a tool that

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,360
we have for

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,400
uh measuring and monitoring um the state

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,040
of routing security on the internet

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,680
so um i'm not going to go into too much

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,360
technical detail about how the global

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,799
routing system works um

40
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,200
i think most people here are technical

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
uh but just a very brief background

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,560
um so there are around 70 000 networks

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,240
that are connected to the internet

44
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,439
um which are identified using um

45
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,439
an autonomous system number or a s

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,759
number um

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,560
and at least 70 000 around 10 000 of

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
these are what you'd call multi-home

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,479
so they have at least two other

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,600
connections to

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,520
other networks on the internet um and

52
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,119
that's primarily what we're interested

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,640
in rather than the

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,560
60 000 stub also stub networks

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,439
so routers use bgp to exchange

56
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,080
reachability

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,639
information um in other words uh the

58
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,720
networks they know how to reach

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,959
uh and then these routers build a

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:15,840
routing table

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,360
which they use to pick the best route

62
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,879
when sending a packet

63
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,599
based on different metrics but typically

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,799
based on the shortest path

65
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,319
now the problem with bgp is that

66
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,840
it's really entirely based on verified

67
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,800
trust between networks

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
there isn't inherently any built-in

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,920
validation that

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,280
bgp updates are legitimate um and really

71
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,319
anybody that's

72
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,080
on the internet or running a network

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,680
that's connected to the internet

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,400
can announce that they're anything um

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,200
they can announce

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,319
ip prefixes that they they don't they're

77
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,920
not authorized to originate

78
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,920
they can announce is numbers that don't

79
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,440
belong to them

80
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,519
um and this is not helped by really a

81
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,879
lack of uh

82
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,120
reliable resource data so how do we

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,080
actually go and check

84
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,480
this information this is hampered a bit

85
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,200
because

86
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
even with the whois databases and the

87
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,560
irs

88
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,640
anybody can really put information in

89
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,000
there

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,519
and the upshot is that the routing

91
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,760
system is under attack

92
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,879
and it's under attack every day

93
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,800
now there are three main incidents that

94
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,959
cause the problems

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,400
one is a route hijack so this is where

96
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,720
a network operator or an attacker is

97
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,000
impersonating another network

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,599
operator and this can cause packets to

99
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,200
be forwarded to the wrong place

100
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,959
uh it can cause denial of service

101
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,959
attacks they can be used for traffic

102
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,799
interception

103
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,400
there's been a number of well-publicized

104
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,040
cases around this

105
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,440
for example going back to 2008

106
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,000
one of the big publicized events with

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,760
pakistan telecom

108
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,120
but there's been a number of incidents

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,080
over the years since then

110
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,239
so you have route links as well um so

111
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,400
this is very similar to a route hijack

112
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,040
so this is where the network network

113
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,080
operator

114
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,760
announces to one of its upstream

115
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,120
providers that it has a route to a

116
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,400
destination through another provider

117
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,880
so this could be used this causes

118
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,320
traffic to be diverted to the wrong

119
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,959
place

120
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,120
um often it will reach the eventual

121
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,440
destination but

122
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,960
as well as being inconvenient and

123
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,759
sometimes causing um

124
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,880
outages and delays in traffic it can be

125
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,240
used for traffic inspection and

126
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,120
reconnaissance

127
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,840
um as well there's been a number of

128
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,280
route links actually big route links

129
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,880
this year

130
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,160
one two or three i months ago earlier in

131
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,040
the year

132
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
um so this is something that is

133
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,759
happening quite regularly

134
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,199
and then you have ip address spoofing

135
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,880
which is probably familiar to maybe most

136
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,560
people in the circ community

137
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,320
uh this is where someone creates an ip

138
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,080
packet with a false source ip address

139
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,840
to hide their identity or to impersonate

140
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,840
their own computing system

141
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,120
and this is the root cause of the

142
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,440
reflection ddos attacks um

143
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,800
so again these are probably quite

144
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,280
familiar to to

145
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,160
the sea cert community now you might

146
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
hear about the well-publicized events

147
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,800
um there was one in brazil i say two

148
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,880
months ago just two months ago

149
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,000
uh but just an example from this year um

150
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,960
six months earlier this year uh this

151
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,680
show you the

152
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
the attacks uh that are happening are

153
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,520
not attacked some of these uh

154
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,440
um actually these are attacks actually

155
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,880
this graph so these are the

156
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,680
incidents that are happening um that

157
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,639
happened every day

158
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,880
uh in the first six months of 2020.

159
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,520
okay so that brings us to manners um so

160
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,120
what is manners

161
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,800
well this is really trying to bring

162
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
together all of the

163
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,120
well-established industry practices um

164
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,479
that help address

165
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,440
or improve ration security so a lot of

166
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,720
you know the issues with

167
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,240
the global routing system have been

168
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,160
acknowledged and identified for many

169
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,960
many years

170
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,199
um and a number of solutions have been

171
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,919
proposed and in some cases implemented

172
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,080
uh but these are really very piecemeal

173
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,720
um they're not always fully implemented

174
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,240
uh not all the network operators are

175
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,919
doing this um

176
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,479
so what we try to do is bring together

177
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,319
the all of the best practices

178
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,400
um and sort of package this up and say

179
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,759
okay if you

180
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,160
we produce these actions so in case of

181
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,560
network operators there's four actions

182
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,080
if you implement these actions this

183
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,400
should really um help eliminate most of

184
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,319
the common threats in the global routing

185
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,080
system

186
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,720
but it's also a statement that you know

187
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,479
if you're participating in this scheme

188
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,400
then you're sharing responsibility for

189
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,319
the internet infrastructure

190
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,240
so it's responsible operators saying you

191
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,840
know we need to acknowledge there's a

192
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,360
problem with the routing system we need

193
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,479
to improve that

194
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,360
and we're committed to cleaning that up

195
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,080
so we have

196
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,680
uh three programs um i'm not going to go

197
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,199
into all of them in depth but i'm going

198
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,720
to just focus on the network operators

199
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,080
program which is the one that we have

200
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,319
the most participants in

201
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,560
so there's four actions for this um for

202
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,319
example in section one that's filtering

203
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,440
so this is about

204
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,759
uh preventing propagation of incorrect

205
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,199
routines and uh

206
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,599
about propagation of incorrect routing

207
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,280
information

208
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,000
um so we that that's a mandatory action

209
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,560
that

210
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
if you're participating in the scheme

211
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,560
then um you should be implementing this

212
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,840
making sure you only announce what

213
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,000
you're authorized to announce

214
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,560
uh we have a an optional action which is

215
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,520
anti-spoofing

216
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,400
so this is really ensuring that your own

217
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,680
only traffic

218
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,520
coming out of your network well has the

219
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,840
correct iep addresses

220
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,759
um there's no spoof type addresses

221
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,440
action free is coordination so this is

222
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,039
really making sure that you have

223
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,160
um an up-to-date um

224
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,199
and responsive contact in one of the rar

225
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,440
databases or you can also put it into

226
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,639
peering db as well

227
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,039
so if there is a problem people know

228
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,479
that they can contact you

229
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,360
and you will respond to whatever

230
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,919
incident is observed

231
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,039
and then finally we have global

232
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,120
validation so this is one of two things

233
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,199
and one is publishing your routing data

234
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,759
in a internet browsing registry so this

235
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,360
would be as numbers

236
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,000
ip prefixes so this publishes that

237
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,919
you're authorized to originate this

238
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,879
these number resources um but preferably

239
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,319
we would like you to create

240
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,520
um rowers for this so use rpki

241
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,360
you cryptographic cryptographically

242
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,879
attest that

243
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,919
um you're authorized to originate

244
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,120
um these number of resources

245
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,200
there are two other programs and one for

246
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,000
isps they don't tend to uh

247
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,719
appear on the global in in the bgp

248
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,320
tables so

249
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,800
uh but ifps play an important role in um

250
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,720
encouraging their members to sign up to

251
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,800
manners so we have a separate set of

252
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
actions for them

253
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,720
and we also have a a relatively new

254
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
program for cdn and cloud providers

255
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,120
which

256
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,720
have very similar actions to the network

257
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,160
operators

258
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,680
but i'm not going into too much detail

259
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,600
here because this is really about

260
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,080
the tool that we're using to support

261
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,920
this

262
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,959
okay so routing security and sea serps

263
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,279
okay why why are we interested in

264
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,720
talking to you

265
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,680
um well i think it's no surprise that

266
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,640
certs

267
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,399
are monitoring and responding to network

268
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,959
security incidents

269
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,959
and you're also involved in developing

270
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,640
security awareness and mitigation

271
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,240
measures

272
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,360
now the global routing system is a very

273
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
key element of critical infrastructure

274
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,519
um it's actually as important as

275
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,080
anything else if not more important

276
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,279
um but i think in general csets do not

277
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,279
don't include browsing security within

278
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,200
their service portfolios

279
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,519
um so this is really where we're coming

280
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,720
from that

281
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,320
we feel that this should be something

282
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,240
that seetha should be

283
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,279
considering so yeah we really see the

284
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,959
seat of communities being critical to

285
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,399
the success

286
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,519
of the manners initiative

287
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,399
okay so what what can you do um okay

288
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,160
firstly you can really raise awareness

289
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,959
of

290
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,360
um these routine security issues within

291
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,800
your constituencies

292
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,279
um but you can also raise awareness in

293
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,800
the national critical infrastructure

294
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,399
activities as well

295
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,279
we are talking to some governments and

296
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:21,839
um

297
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,640
national certs but um i think you know

298
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,440
this is a

299
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,279
both a push and a pull um activity and

300
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,880
this is something that everybody needs

301
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,240
to be aware of at least involved in

302
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,160
running the internet

303
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,959
um you can also add routing security

304
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:37,600
incident

305
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,120
monitoring and handling to the service

306
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,519
portfolio

307
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,360
so this becomes part of your normal

308
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,560
range of activities and also help

309
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,279
organize

310
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,920
router security workshops um original

311
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,200
security curriculum

312
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,560
so you can train people to look at this

313
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,760
and to analyze this or to be aware of

314
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
that this is also an area of network

315
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,880
security that should be

316
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,920
considered and then of course uh looking

317
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,519
at the network forensic side as well you

318
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,200
know who is originating these incidents

319
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,560
where are they coming from

320
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,800
who are the culprits uh that can also be

321
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,480
part of this as well

322
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,920
we don't do too much of that the

323
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,760
forensic side i mean

324
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,440
it's a little bit of a side subject for

325
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,519
us we're more interested in actually

326
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,040
preventing the problem rather than

327
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,680
trying to

328
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,160
investigate and cure the problem um but

329
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,600
we can definitely see that you know if

330
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,120
we can identify some of the worst

331
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,880
offenders then that might also be

332
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,160
uh useful and also you can add variation

333
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,200
security to

334
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,959
auditing network security auditing

335
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,240
programs as well you know this should be

336
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,440
part of the whole holistic

337
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,839
look at you know is a network uh your

338
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,079
network secure

339
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,959
so we have this tool we developed this

340
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:45,680
tool

341
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,519
uh which will help with the monitoring

342
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,800
um see

343
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,880
that's like tools and this is another

344
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,800
tool you can add

345
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,639
to the armory so the manus observatory

346
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,279
this is

347
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,320
a web-based system it draws on

348
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,360
a number of different data sources

349
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
so these are all publicly available data

350
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,680
sources uh

351
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,120
which you can all go to you can go and

352
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,959
look at individually

353
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,120
they all have their own websites you can

354
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,800
go and look at that information

355
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,399
but it's very hard to pull that together

356
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,560
into a general overview you know you

357
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,680
have to go to

358
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,320
multiple sites some of the information

359
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,360
is quite hard to

360
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,279
to visualize or to make sense of

361
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,040
so what we really needed was a dashboard

362
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,639
type arrangement where you could just

363
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,760
take a look and say

364
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,839
across the board this network is doing

365
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,959
the right thing or is not doing the

366
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:35,519
right thing

367
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,639
or has problems or doesn't have problems

368
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,120
um and then we also wanted to look at

369
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,760
well what

370
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,000
is the state of reality security getting

371
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,519
better or worse over time

372
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,440
you know is the manners initiative are

373
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,200
the rational security measures

374
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,000
having an impact uh so we can look back

375
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
now over about two years of data and say

376
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,560
okay

377
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,680
there isn't worse or better um and it's

378
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,880
actually more useful even for the

379
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,480
individual networks so you can actually

380
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,600
see whether they've

381
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,880
improved and they can see where their

382
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,639
problems are

383
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,519
so that's really what we're we have this

384
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,560
for

385
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,079
so some of the publicly available data

386
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,320
sources it's pgp stream

387
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
uh where you pull on the cider report

388
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,480
that's produced by ap nick labs

389
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,000
the cada spooper database um you can run

390
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,959
anti-spoofer software um and that will

391
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,000
check whether

392
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,340
packets will emanate from your network

393
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,680
[Music]

394
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,959
we pull on that and then there's also

395
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,920
the rar databases

396
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,519
the internet routing registries and we

397
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,920
have been using rpko validator although

398
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,360
that's going to be going away in a year

399
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,480
or so so we'll need to replace that

400
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
okay so i'm going to give a demo of the

401
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,519
um

402
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,120
of the actual observatory itself um

403
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,639
if i can find the um if i can actually

404
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,000
find the uh

405
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,160
screen and uh

406
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,439
so yeah this is the um

407
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,839
if you come to this um

408
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,560
to the url so it's

409
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,480
observatory.manage.org

410
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,680
you get a dashboard view

411
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,160
initially this will show you the whole

412
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,480
world though this is statistics for the

413
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,040
whole

414
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,920
uh for the whole of the internet um and

415
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,519
this is still november so you can

416
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,519
actually go back and look month by month

417
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,160
in the past um and this will be up to

418
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
date as of yesterday so we

419
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,079
it's a day behind but it rolls over

420
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,279
every day this information all this

421
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,360
information is updated every day

422
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,639
so looking at look are is there supposed

423
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,959
to be a map here

424
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,399
uh can you see the screen

425
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,560
uh we can see the top part of the uh

426
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,920
browser

427
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,360
okay can you see the

428
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,880
uh the the map you can't see the map

429
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,560
no okay uh

430
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,680
that's awkward let me just stop the

431
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,800
share

432
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,180
and

433
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,229
[Music]

434
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,560
okay that worked of course earlier and

435
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,320
now it doesn't work

436
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,079
in the tradition of all live demos can

437
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,079
you see that yes

438
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,079
great brilliant okay i don't know what

439
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,920
went wrong there okay so

440
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,399
um you see the dashboard so you can see

441
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,920
the map the global map

442
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,040
this is the information for the whole um

443
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,199
the whole of the internet so you can see

444
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,399
action by action

445
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,279
um the the how the network the whole of

446
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,720
the internet conforms with each of the

447
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,040
four

448
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,639
actions so you have filtering

449
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,639
anti-spoofing coordination

450
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,399
and then action four which is global

451
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,079
validation um

452
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,639
irr and global validation rpki so that

453
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,160
fourth action is split into two

454
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
aspects so you can see you know

455
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,079
generally

456
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,600
there's not too many route incidents in

457
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,040
the scale of the internet but of course

458
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,480
one percent

459
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,199
still means a lot of incidents um for

460
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,000
anti-spoofing

461
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,360
that's the one thing we can't check

462
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,199
passively we have to the

463
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,480
networks actually have to run the

464
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,880
spoofer software so for most networks we

465
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,399
don't have any information there

466
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,880
but for the ones we do we can provide

467
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,320
that information

468
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,480
uh it looks like for coordination 90 of

469
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,680
the networks have a

470
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,560
active contact uh in the in one of the

471
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,639
rar databases

472
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,240
um generally networks are doing pretty

473
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,480
well with putting this their information

474
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,040
into

475
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,000
um into an irr there are number

476
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,959
resources

477
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,360
um they're still 13 they're not doing

478
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,000
that

479
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,399
and then with rpki only 20 of the

480
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,680
networks have actually

481
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,480
have uh signed are signing their their

482
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,040
routes

483
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,240
so that's something to work on there

484
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,399
so we can actually look at this by uh

485
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,560
region um

486
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,839
different region we can look by

487
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,320
aggregate by un region by sub-region by

488
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,000
rar region

489
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
so we could look for aaron for example

490
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,079
and get an update on the

491
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,600
um the statistics there it's pretty much

492
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,320
the same

493
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,000
for our owners for the world although

494
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,440
slightly worse on

495
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,000
on irr and definitely worse on rpki for

496
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,720
some reason

497
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,959
so something for the north american

498
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,559
market to work on

499
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,039
um but we can also do this by country

500
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:07,839
and as as

501
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,799
we're virtually we're virtually in

502
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,679
canada

503
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,359
this time we should have been in canada

504
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,599
i should pick on canada

505
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,559
uh and we can get similar statistics to

506
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,280
canada

507
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,559
um as well now this

508
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,959
is not very exciting so far it's just

509
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,000
academic interest

510
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,160
so what we really need to know is you

511
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,360
know what's the information for

512
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,200
individual networks

513
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
so um we can actually get a list of all

514
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,919
the networks in canada

515
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,960
um that you can see and you can see the

516
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,840
state of their

517
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,400
routing conformance for each of these

518
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,520
networks

519
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,360
these are actually sorted by a s number

520
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,120
at the moment i'm just going to pick on

521
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,720
one and i'm sorry if

522
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,440
they have one of their representatives

523
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,200
uh in the audience

524
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,640
i'm just picking on you because it's a

525
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,679
big well-known network in canada

526
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,280
this is not about embarrassing anything

527
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,799
to embarrass anybody but it's a good

528
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,760
example

529
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,919
so i'm going to pick on as812

530
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,720
and i can break this down by individual

531
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,039
individual incidents so i can see that

532
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,120
they in november they had route leaks

533
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,320
they had a route leak

534
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,799
um it looks like 83 135 1680

535
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,840
um and you can actually identify the

536
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,840
path where this is coming from as well

537
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,840
um there is a reference to the bgp

538
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,240
stream which flagged this incident

539
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,160
um it's fair to say sometimes you get

540
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,360
false positives but

541
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,840
at least that helps identify where the

542
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,919
problems may be coming from

543
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,799
um they also had some bogons so a bogon

544
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,600
is you know

545
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,080
an ip number resource that shouldn't be

546
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,679
routed on the internet so it could be a

547
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,799
private as

548
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,840
it could be a reserved as or a reserved

549
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,120
range of ip prefixes

550
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,520
so these are not so bad as route

551
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,160
incidents

552
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,559
but they shouldn't really be seen on the

553
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,000
internet

554
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,480
but we flag these as well quite often

555
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
you'll see private as numbers or private

556
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,799
ranges of ip numbers will appear

557
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,200
this one doesn't appear to be that but

558
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,320
again you can see

559
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,720
when this occurred and what the paths

560
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,240
were uh

561
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,840
through the internet so it helps you

562
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
identify the problems

563
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,120
and it's fair to say you know a lot of

564
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,559
networks aren't aware they have these

565
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,120
problems

566
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,640
um they just don't know that they have

567
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,720
these routines happening um they may

568
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,440
have some

569
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,360
filter there's something wrong with the

570
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,400
filters or there isn't a filter

571
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,760
and they're just simply not where this

572
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
is happening um

573
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,600
so be a bug on ais as we can look at as

574
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,200
well um again

575
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,640
um 27470 i'm not sure what that one is

576
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,120
but uh some of these are administrative

577
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,799
pogons as well they're they're not they

578
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,320
are assigned but they've been flagged as

579
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,440
programs for some

580
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,799
um administrative reason we can actually

581
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,640
look by um

582
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,559
if there's been spoof packets observed

583
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,840
from the network um

584
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,120
we can actually look at where they're

585
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,679
coming from um this network

586
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,120
doesn't have we haven't seen any spoof

587
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,360
packets probably they haven't run the

588
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,720
spoofer software but then we can look at

589
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,320
the the unregistered routes

590
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
um so the routes that haven't been put

591
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
into an irr

592
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,840
and you can get a complete list of those

593
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,600
so you'll see a lot of ipv6 addresses

594
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,240
here and that's often what you find that

595
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,919
networks may register their ipv4

596
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,600
addresses and forget about their ipv6

597
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,400
addresses

598
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,520
so there's really a lot of ipv6 here but

599
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,600
it does help identify what needs to be

600
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,240
done um but ultimately uh

601
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,039
you know we we we we're looking towards

602
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,039
moving towards rpki

603
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,880
um this network has has rowers

604
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,679
created rowers for just under half of

605
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,840
their

606
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,520
prefixes but if you want to know which

607
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,559
prefixes haven't been um don't have

608
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,159
rowers signed rowers

609
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,720
you can actually go to we have a link to

610
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,440
the

611
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,039
right stat for this af

612
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,400
we're not recreating the wheel here

613
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,480
there's a perfectly good system already

614
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,280
so this will show which prefixes have

615
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,240
rpki

616
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,600
and actually irr resources

617
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,240
signed okay so that's a very brief

618
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,440
update

619
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,720
you can actually go and look at the

620
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,520
history as well for a network

621
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,039
so this is the history for this 812

622
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:23,919
network

623
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,440
you can see they've got a little bit of

624
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,159
a history of route incidents

625
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,960
looking at uh some other things looks

626
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,000
like they

627
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,760
probably doing anti-spoofing measures

628
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,679
and sometimes

629
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,799
um and with respect to um

630
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,360
the irr and pki gives you a state of

631
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,880
an idea of the state of how well they're

632
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,480
doing now so you can go back and look

633
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,840
month by month and actually look at the

634
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,080
history as well

635
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,000
so that's really a very very brief um

636
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,480
demonstration i'm just going to go back

637
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,559
to the

638
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,200
presentation now hopefully you can see

639
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,360
this

640
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,280
so i did have some reserve slides just

641
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,000
in case the demo failed which

642
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,520
you know at a precaution

643
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,840
but so basically at the moment if the

644
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,919
public the public can go and view

645
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,559
the overall regional and economy

646
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,080
aggregated data

647
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,679
um at the moment only managed

648
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,919
participants have access to detailed

649
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,280
data

650
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,120
and that's really because there's some

651
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,559
false positives

652
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,200
sometimes there's reasons for

653
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,760
non-conformancy

654
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,720
um and there's all other reasons that we

655
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,400
we're really trying to persuade networks

656
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,240
rather than punish networks or to

657
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,559
expose networks so that's why at the

658
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,480
moment only the detailed information is

659
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,280
available to

660
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,919
actually manage participants but we can

661
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,200
create accounts for

662
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,120
aspirants people that want to sign up to

663
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,320
manners and need to work through

664
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,679
problems

665
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,039
and we've also been creating accounts

666
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,039
for search as well so we can create an

667
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,200
account for your whole constituency

668
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,799
and you can look at all of the networks

669
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,240
that uh

670
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,200
that are part of your constituency so

671
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,880
you can look at

672
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,919
we did this for cert nz for example um

673
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,440
they can take a look at all the networks

674
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,000
in there

675
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,240
in new zealand and see check them out

676
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,360
for russian security issues

677
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,679
uh but this is all public data anyway

678
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,440
you could actually find this out

679
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,039
even if you don't go to the observatory

680
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,559
it's just slightly more inaccessible

681
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,960
but in time we will probably move this

682
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,880
to being public data

683
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,240
it's just not at the moment okay

684
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,559
in terms of participation we've been

685
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,760
growing a lot um

686
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,559
this is we're up to nearly 500 isps and

687
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,200
now

688
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,679
participating in this program i think

689
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,720
we're representing

690
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,840
something like 600 or 650 or 700 as

691
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,880
numbers

692
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,520
um so it's been really this year has

693
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,559
been

694
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,000
locked down has been good because people

695
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
have been fixing their routing problems

696
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,279
and the networks

697
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,679
um the the isps have been signing up

698
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,960
we've had a lot of sign ups

699
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,679
on the xp side um and then on the cloud

700
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,159
side

701
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,799
this is relatively quite a new program

702
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,440
so

703
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,080
we have 14 participants so far but

704
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,880
that's been growing as well

705
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,880
um just in terms of the search though we

706
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,640
don't have a lot of cert participation

707
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,240
to be fair and that's what we'd like to

708
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,039
see differently

709
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,320
we'd like to encourage um so tim coomery

710
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,799
they are members um and tw cert the

711
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,760
members

712
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,360
uh although we do have quite a few

713
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
participants that operate certs as well

714
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,679
so

715
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,919
even if the cert isn't directly a member

716
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:32,720
um they

717
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,880
they're probably the search of a a

718
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,000
manners participant

719
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,880
so the participation rate is higher than

720
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,799
it would immediately appear

721
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,200
um and then certain zed we've been

722
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,080
talking to

723
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,520
um again because yeah it's a good

724
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,080
we've been testing our ability to create

725
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,559
um

726
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,320
sort of constituency groups as well so

727
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,760
that was quite a useful

728
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,799
uh interaction okay

729
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,120
and so that should be um just about it

730
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,760
um if you're interested in joining

731
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,320
manners

732
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,760
um please have a look at our website

733
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,720
or drop me an email i will say that you

734
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,080
know certs they're not necessarily

735
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,320
operating their own networks or

736
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,960
may not even have an as number so it may

737
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,640
not be completely

738
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,080
appropriate to join the network

739
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,320
operators program for example but

740
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,880
again we can provide accounts for your

741
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,799
constituencies which may be useful in

742
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:27,919
helping

743
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,200
diagnose routing problems

744
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,400
so yeah we'd encourage encourage

745
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,679
everyone to get involved

746
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,200
and help improve the security of the

747
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,559
browser security on the internet

748
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,159
and that's that's it from me

749
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,000
yes thank you uh we have a question

750
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,520
so um it's about the

751
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,720
the experience of handling bjp poisoning

752
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,679
for an as to filter poisoned

753
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,600
advertisements it can be difficult to

754
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,520
fully understand what is driving the

755
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,320
behavior

756
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,480
without having insider information from

757
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,000
the isps

758
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,159
policies so is manners experiencing the

759
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:14,559
same

760
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,000
obstacles in gaining getting the policy

761
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,120
from the isps

762
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,799
and how is the best way to deal with

763
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,480
that

764
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,760
um yes we are we have this problem um

765
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,600
and no we don't have an answer yet uh so

766
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,080
uh this is something that we we're

767
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,679
actually having doing some research on

768
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,880
at the moment because we do have this

769
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,520
problem

770
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,840
um so it is very hard sometimes to

771
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,880
attribute

772
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,840
um to attribute where these issues are

773
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,799
coming from

774
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,279
um all we can do is observe the problem

775
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,240
um

776
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,640
so probably looking at different data

777
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,600
points

778
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,279
we think may be the way forward

779
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,799
and we so the for example bgp stream

780
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,279
although

781
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,200
i think the commercial version does look

782
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,880
at multiple data points

783
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,120
um the version we're using the non-paid

784
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
version and the public version

785
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,000
um doesn't do that so this is a bit of

786
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,080
an issue in diagnosing problems so at

787
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,600
the moment we can only identify the

788
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,640
problems

789
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,320
um we can't necessarily attribute the

790
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,760
problem but that is something we're

791
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,600
aware of and working on

792
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,840
um i don't think i have the answer yet

793
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,640
um we have a another question are there

794
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,360
any uh possible issues if manners

795
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,600
policies could be actually considered to

796
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,360
be enforced by the regulatory

797
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,600
authorities yes

798
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,679
so okay this is this is a question that

799
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,480
comes up

800
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,960
um so we're not wanting to make this

801
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,159
a regulatory thing this is really about

802
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:50,960
trying to get

803
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,559
operators to do the right thing to see

804
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,559
they have issues and it's in their best

805
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,600
interest to

806
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,320
implement good routing practice and

807
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,279
actually i think we've been very

808
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,320
successful at that

809
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,760
so even some of the worst what you

810
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,440
consider the worst offenders on the net

811
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,320
on the internet

812
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
who are well publicized and well known

813
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,159
we've actually been talking to them

814
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,679
they've been using this tool to work

815
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,799
through their problems and they said

816
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,200
look you know we've got problems

817
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,760
we know we're causing problems we just

818
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,960
don't know where the problems are and

819
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,159
they've actually been actively

820
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,679
using this tool and working through the

821
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,279
problems and

822
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,360
uh actually yesterday we had a we were

823
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,840
discussing with a very big

824
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,600
network which is one of the well-known

825
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,360
offenders and they've

826
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,799
incidents have dropped from a large

827
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,720
amount to almost nothing in the space of

828
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,919
three months

829
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,279
so that's where we want to get to we

830
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,600
want to do encouragement um

831
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,159
so stick sorry carrot rather than stick

832
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,720
rather than say okay this becomes a

833
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,240
regulatory thing

834
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,000
um now that's not to say that

835
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,600
governments may not pick up on this or

836
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,120
somebody may not pick up on this but

837
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,720
that's not what madness is about this is

838
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,520
a

839
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,880
community industry-led initiative to

840
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,840
improve the state

841
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,360
of reaction security and that's

842
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,799
absolutely where we want to come from

843
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,039
so one final question really short do

844
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,159
you plan to provide an api

845
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,080
so there is an api um

846
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,760
it's very limited at the moment but yes

847
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,360
there is it's not widely used

848
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,799
but we do have that opportunity oh that

849
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,679
