identified when you do incident

108
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,680
international

109
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,840

with classified information

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,680
when doing international insight

113
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,040
response

114
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,000
next slide please so for the ransomware

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,360
case

116
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,599
we had or there was one ransomware case

117
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,920
just called in country x

118
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,840
there was a law uh

119
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,680
in the case investigation ongoing for

120
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,120
law enforcement

121
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
which had access to a c2 server of a

122
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,440
ransomware group

123
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,840
and the extracted data for

124
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,199
yeah four victims and but it was

125
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,040
too much data so they asked national

126
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,320
assert for help and the

127
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,520
national search did a one-time effort to

128
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,720
extract all the data

129
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,440
and send it out to all the other

130
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,199
national asserts

131
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,000
and we received the data notified our

132
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
victims

133
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,520
and as this was a one-time effort but

134
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,680
as this was ongoing they kept more and

135
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,800
more victims

136
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,919
appearing on a server each and every day

137
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,759
so the national thought asked for help

138
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,440
because they couldn't do it alone

139
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,680
sent out all the victim notification

140
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,199
next please

141
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,240
so they invited other national asserts

142
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,520
for hackerson

143
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,800
to work on that data because the police

144
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
was insisting that as this was an

145
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,919
ongoing case

146
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,960
all the road data had to stay inside the

147
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
country border so it wasn't allowed to

148
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,720
to leave the country

149
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,000
so we went on site with our forensic

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,440
experts

151
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,080
next slide please and learned a lot on

152
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,440
this case so

153
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,160
the first thing when we arrived was uh

154
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,759
we were asked oh good

155
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,080
the germans are here we are little spars

156
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,360
of incident managers

157
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,840
would you mind coordinating the

158
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,360
hackathon

159
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,680
yeah of course we are germans we love

160
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,800
organizing stuff

161
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,080
but if we had known it at warns

162
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,039
we would have uh brought our own instant

163
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,639
managers

164
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,680
and not only our black kodi uh forensic

165
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,039
analysis

166
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,360
so this was the first thing then we

167
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,160
learned

168
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,000
yeah you could overcome bureaucratic

169
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,360
regulations

170
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,919
it needs a lot of talk with the police

171
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,680
some maybe some ndas

172
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,160
and some trust building but afterwards

173
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,600
the police was

174
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
able or allowing

175
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,080
us to to receive the raw data also

176
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,840
in our country so they were able to

177
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,280
share data outside

178
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,880
and we could then uh do the work from

179
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,840
our home office

180
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,400
and but what we then saw is that when

181
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,960
every team affects them went home

182
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,800
they uh yeah they kept working on their

183
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,600
own

184
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,720
um the sharing declined and also there

185
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,479
was a lot of duplicate work

186
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,720
done so a lot of scripts were wrote by

187
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,520
many teams

188
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,000
on their own and shared afterwards just

189
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
to learn that

190
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,400
yeah this just was the other road to

191
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,880
then it was also clear about the outcome

192
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,280
what was the real goal of this effort

193
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,880
because it was running for months and

194
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,440
for months this case

195
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,080
and it's some time we're to decide when

196
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,400
we have to pull back our resources

197
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,800
to have them for our own cases and just

198
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,080
do the minimal effort

199
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,599
to yeah work on that case from this

200
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,800
other country

201
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,840
next uh yeah next please and

202
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,759
one thing of course we learned is now

203
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,199
we're preparing for the worst case when

204
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,080
going on site also with our merch team

205
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,199
and but this was just as

206
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,240
i call it a small ransomware but with

207
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,639
many

208
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,280
victims but it was a small case now

209
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,240
imagine

210
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,000
you have in this corona type a large

211
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,080
pharmaceutical company a multinational

212
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,199
company

213
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,560
which has its hq in country a and it's

214
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,120
a production country b and they have a

215
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,639
compromise

216
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,479
so it's maybe even a critical

217
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,000
infrastructure in your country

218
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,039
so you start keep the

219
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,680
the incident the work and of course the

220
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
national assert gets involved

221
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,759
the police gets involved if it's an apt

222
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,319
you have your intelligence services

223
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,720
on board and all the other parties like

224
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,759
consultants

225
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,919
and incent responders the service

226
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,280
providers

227
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,360
which are all on that case and this is

228
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,080
just in your country now if you have to

229
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,479
work with the parties or on the other

230
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,039
side of the river in the other country

231
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,560
it gets more and more complicated and

232
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,639
what we learned next please is that

233
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,639
it's not like a linear function when you

234
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,080
get more and more players and more

235
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,199
munitions but

236
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,919
the complexity is more some kind of an

237
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,320
exponential curve

238
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,000
with dealing all different laws

239
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,159
languages expectations

240
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,919
and also different cultures when working

241
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,440
together and

242
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,360
yeah we decided to write a paper to

243
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,519
write the most important things down

244
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,120
you have to think about when working

245
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,480
with international partners on

246
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,000
international case

247
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
and now for the main course literature

248
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,519
leticia will now

249
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,760
tell you about the five phases we

250
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,920
identified

251
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,480
yes thank you michael so before i go

252
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,360
into more depth

253
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,519
i want to emphasize that the itu-hop

254
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,279
concept is not meant to be a

255
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,200
prescriptive standard that needs to be

256
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,560
strictly followed

257
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,959
but it is more meant to be an open

258
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,959
framework that can be worked on and can

259
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,120
be adapted however you need it for your

260
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,399
purposes

261
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,480
what we wanted to do and what our aim

262
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,600
was to

263
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,160
write a paper that you can just easily

264
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,920
pull out in case and cross-border

265
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,760
incident happens so you have all the

266
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,200
checklists in there

267
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,640
you know all the important things to

268
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
think about you can read about

269
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,959
potential hazards potential frictions

270
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,640
intentions that can happen

271
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,320
and maybe even problems that you have

272
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,160
never thought about before

273
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,480
but they have happened and we just tried

274
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,800
to comprehensively write it all into one

275
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,920
nice framework that you can use anytime

276
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,640
so

277
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,760
without further ado going on to the five

278
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,560
phases

279
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,160
it begins all of the planning and

280
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,600
preparation

281
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,360
and let's say it all begins with a

282
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,040
national incident

283
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,360
it can be really a quite small incident

284
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,160
at the beginning

285
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
but as you know happens quite often with

286
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,600
incidents they grow

287
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,079
bigger quite fast supposedly friday

288
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,120
afternoon

289
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,519
and then at some point you have to pull

290
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,360
in more national players

291
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,120
let's think about for example

292
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,519
intelligence agencies the national cert

293
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,920
police law enforcement could be also

294
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,600
many more as we have seen on the slide

295
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,040
before

296
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,560
and then at some point while you're

297
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,800
working together you notice

298
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,000
okay we do need uh to interact

299
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,959
with other partners in other countries

300
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:35,839
because this

301
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,000
incident affects parties in other

302
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,360
countries

303
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,959
so at this point several questions arise

304
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,839
starting with why does this case require

305
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,120
international engagement

306
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,279
is it maybe because you found potential

307
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,720
victims abroad

308
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,200
or is it because the command and control

309
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
server of the attackers is located in a

310
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,800
different country and you need the help

311
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,720
of the law enforcement or

312
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,440
is it just really something minor so at

313
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,600
the beginning before you

314
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,839
dive deep into this whole incident

315
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,399
cross-border incident handling process

316
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,720
you should always consider is just an

317
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,640
email or a phone call enough or do we

318
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,399
need to start this whole process

319
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,240
and engage so many people in this

320
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,040
next question would be sorry next

321
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,480
question would be is

322
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
are we willing to work cooperatively on

323
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,320
the case and does every national player

324
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,680
agree with this step

325
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,760
so sometimes if you think about law

326
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,079
enforcement or intelligence agencies

327
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,839
they're not so keen on working with

328
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,519
their counterparts in certain other

329
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,240
countries

330
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,360
so it is important that if you as a cert

331
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
are the key player in this

332
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,720
scenario to act as a facilitator and

333
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,560
to um you know get everybody on board

334
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,399
keep in mind that not every party is

335
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,480
equally affected anyways

336
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,720
so maybe you don't need the counterpart

337
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,079
for every single party

338
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,000
but just you know the other assert of

339
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,279
another country

340
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,680
but just make clear to communicate this

341
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,480
openly

342
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,560
so everybody knows who will be on board

343
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,320
and that everybody agrees on this

344
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,079
cooperation

345
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,120
and finally at what tlp or secrecy level

346
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,399
can we cooperate

347
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,240
most of you probably already know the

348
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,000
tlp protocol and use it

349
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,560
quite often it is also the preferred

350
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,040
choice

351
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,720
because it you can with this you can

352
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,240
easily determine

353
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,480
which data can be processed by whom and

354
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,079
which information can be shared with

355
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:26,720
whom

356
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,959
but always if you're in doubt consult

357
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,120
with your legal department beforehand

358
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,279
and also consider special arrangements

359
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,880
if the case is under governmental

360
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,440
secrecy restrictions

361
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,000
so once these questions have all been

362
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,279
answered and you're still

363
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,880
sure that yes you need the whole

364
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,880
incident handling process and not just a

365
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,639
quick phone call

366
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,560
this is where transition from a national

367
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,399
to an international cross-border case

368
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:50,959
happens

369
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,200
or as we call it figuratively within

370
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,480
this presentation

371
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,279
the potluck is starting so this means

372
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:57,839
that

373
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,360
several other parties from different

374
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,120
nations will join in

375
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,200
and now you have to ask yourself

376
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,519
are there already established contacts

377
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,720
because

378
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,560
we've all been here right having the

379
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,720
awkward silence moment with people you

380
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,480
have never talked to before

381
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,240
and all of a sudden you're supposed to

382
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,560
work on the teamwork together

383
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,519
so this is more basically a plea to

384
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,760
think about this beforehand to join

385
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,560
certain um international sharing groups

386
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,519
for example egc or iwn where you share

387
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,560
information on a regular basis where you

388
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,639
meet like even if it's virtually in

389
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,000
times of corona or

390
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,399
different by the way you just know the

391
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
faces where you know who to contact you

392
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,480
have

393
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,519
spoken with the people beforehand and so

394
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,199
having this level of trust

395
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,240
makes working together so much easier

396
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,720
next question would be who are the

397
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,240
involved parties

398
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,240
so this should be quite clear to

399
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,600
everybody who's involved

400
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,560
because this can actually lead to

401
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,000
several different problems

402
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,639
on really different levels thinking

403
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,920
about for example

404
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,480
if a crime incident and law enforcement

405
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,160
is involved this could lead

406
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,440
to heavy bureaucratic regulations that

407
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,279
are very time consuming and that you

408
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,079
should consider way ahead

409
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,399
it could also be the case that several

410
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,480
different i.t security service providers

411
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,079
are involved in the case

412
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,760
so this could lead to competitive

413
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
tensions for example

414
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,399
or if you think about it if a ministry

415
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,480
or maybe even a very important person is

416
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,760
involved in the case

417
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,320
it could trigger public attention that

418
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,480
needs special handling as well

419
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,040
so there are so many points to consider

420
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,320
with this that

421
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,240
it should be openly communicated right

422
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,079
in the beginning who you think will be

423
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,880
involved in this case and then always

424
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,680
keep in mind

425
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,199
that the more parties are involved in

426
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,639
the case the more complex and

427
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,760
challenging it gets

428
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,199
as michael presented before

429
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,959
and then finally the last question

430
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,560
within this phase

431
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,880
what are the objectives and expectations

432
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,959
of the involved parties and

433
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,519
this is probably the question of the

434
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,320
phase

435
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,240
because it is also the question that

436
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,920
triggers the most tensions and that

437
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,120
leads to the biggest

438
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,240
stress and problems within the team

439
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,320
so it is very important to openly

440
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,839
communicate this right from the

441
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,440
beginning so that everybody who's

442
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,320
involved

443
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,680
knows what to expect

444
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,639
so the initiating team should at least

445
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,839
vaguely predict

446
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,000
how many human resources it requires

447
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,160
with which skills and for how long

448
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,759
and to stay realistic with this

449
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,440
expectations

450
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,920
and the other involved parties they

451
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,279
should keep in mind that they shouldn't

452
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,839
make any promises that they can't keep

453
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,839
and they should also consider when

454
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,680
joining that there still might arise

455
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,440
national incidents and that they might

456
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,079
have a higher priority

457
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,000
so it is important that the initiating

458
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,240
team clearly states their expectations

459
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,040
at the beginning

460
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,959
because if this is what they expect and

461
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,680
they don't communicate this very clearly

462
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,920
maybe this might be the outcome as we

463
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
have also heard in the ransomware

464
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,759
case at the beginning their their

465
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,440
expectations weren't really clearly

466
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,279
communicated so the wrong people were

467
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:09,839
there

468
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,920
and they couldn't bring the outcome that

469
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,240
was desired

470
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,360
so moving on to phase three the

471
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,079
implementation of the required setup

472
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,320
now that all those first questions have

473
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,240
been answered and dealt with

474
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,560
now it's important to get everybody on

475
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,880
board so everybody's really prepared for

476
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,720
this case

477
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,360
so for this we first have to think about

478
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,920
the case

479
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,399
sodonym so we can communicate in an easy

480
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,040
way

481
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,120
even if we don't have always a secure

482
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,759
line if we have a case platinum that

483
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,560
doesn't um

484
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,399
that is not indicative of the real

485
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,079
incident or company name

486
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,759
it is much more easy to communicate

487
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,560
openly with your team partners

488
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,560
the next question is the language of

489
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,920
choice in this case

490
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,800
it might sound trivial but if you work

491
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,120
then

492
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,440
on reports for example for your national

493
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,560
authorities

494
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,079
and you write them in your mother

495
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,160
language and then you have to translate

496
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,919
them afterwards again to share with your

497
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,720
partners

498
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,799
it's so much more work so it's much

499
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,480
easier to just agree on this in the

500
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,760
beginning and say

501
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,679
okay we will write everything in english

502
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,799
for example

503
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,720
and then you don't have to do this extra

504
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,679
work afterwards again

505
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,919
the next question will be with how many

506
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,280
people are the different parties

507
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,720
involved

508
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,039
so it is quite important to consider the

509
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,559
team sizes

510
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,120
because the number of participants of

511
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,640
each involved party should be in a

512
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,559
realistic proportion to the total team

513
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,840
size of course

514
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,000
so if the entire team is usually only

515
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,840
five people you cannot expect that all

516
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,200
five of them will

517
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,120
be in this international incident as

518
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,360
well so stay realistic with those

519
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,720
expectations

520
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,880
and then in general a too large team

521
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,320
accessory based coordination and

522
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,440
cooperation

523
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,760
but also too small team this means too

524
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,880
much teamwork

525
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880
too much work for every individual in

526
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,080
their team

527
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,000
so keep that in mind when planning how

528
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,080
many people from each team will be

529
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,919
in this teamwork together and finally

530
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,760
how and when can the different parties

531
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,360
or persons be reached

532
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,679
this is actually also sounds quite

533
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,280
trivial but then you

534
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,039
run into those problems for example

535
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,280
talking about bank holidays

536
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,960
so a lot of you who are not german

537
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,720
probably have no idea about the bank

538
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,520
holidays in germany and when they are

539
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,280
vice versa i have no clue about bank

540
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,880
holidays in other countries

541
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,960
and then the situations happen that you

542
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,039
have something really important

543
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,720
that you want to share right now and

544
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,640
then nobody's reachable and you have no

545
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,760
clue why

546
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,400
and then this causes just unnecessary

547
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:40,960
stress

548
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,520
and frustration and it would be so much

549
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,480
easier to just

550
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,320
you know share maybe a team calendar

551
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,840
with your teammates

552
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,880
to just let them know if you have a

553
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,799
planned vacation if you have a planned

554
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,480
absence or if there's a bank holiday in

555
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,520
your country

556
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,080
so you can just take away this potential

557
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,440
problem

558
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,039
but just beforehand and um talking about

559
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,440
planned vacation etc it's also important

560
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,840
that at least the most important roles

561
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,880
always appoint at least one deputy so

562
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,440
if one person also leaves not planned

563
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,720
for example being sick

564
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,640
you at least have one other counterpart

565
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,919
that can still

566
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,440
you know take information that you can

567
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,960
still reach that you can still talk

568
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,760
about

569
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,080
and just to give the other team the the

570
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,240
feeling of yes they are still in here

571
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,080
and not at all it's all about this one

572
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,320
person if that person is gone nobody can

573
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,200
be reached anymore

574
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,960
so then as we have all as we have been

575
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,480
already talking about the people

576
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,960
involved and how we can reach them

577
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,320
it is also the question who is

578
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,400
responsible for what

579
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,600
it has been proven to be quite handy to

580
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,480
define

581
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,799
at least three roles in each incident

582
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,559
which is the incident manager the

583
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,440
technical lead

584
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
and the person in charge of charge of

585
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,600
red intelligence

586
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,559
it might be that actually one person

587
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,320
takes all three roles

588
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,400
but you should still at least define

589
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,360
them

590
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,520
because they have different

591
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,120
responsibilities and having this role

592
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,960
you also have a different view on the

593
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,080
whole topic

594
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,600
or case and finally what kind of

595
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,440
infrastructure and technical setup is

596
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,799
required

597
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,679
so to keep everything up and running and

598
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,039
also to

599
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,440
show the people that you what you're

600
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,559
working on

601
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,720
it's much easier to have a collaborative

602
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,799
case documentation

603
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,559
and to also have a shared cooperative

604
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,880
working space which could be a wiki

605
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,280
or a metamouse chat or audio video

606
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,080
conferencing tools etc etc

607
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,760
but then it is also important that you

608
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,919
have enough local storage

609
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,840
and then a really important point is to

610
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,960
have

611
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,080
uh at least a

612
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,799
moderately fast uh possibility for file

613
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,840
exchange because this can

614
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,320
cause such a delay if a team is waiting

615
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,640
forever to get the data downloaded

616
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,720
if they don't have a reasonable way to

617
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,760
exchange files with each other

618
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,760
so um what we've also thought about

619
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,840
what we might helpful is version

620
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,480
management log management and

621
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,320
then really triple things like think

622
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
about a stable wi-fi network or

623
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,120
encryption

624
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,200
methods if you're um for example on-site

625
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,600
and so we have created an entire

626
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,360
checklist with all the things we thought

627
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,080
about

628
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,760
when it comes to the infrastructure and

629
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,600
technical setup and you can read about

630
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:33,919
that

631
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,120
in the paper so

632
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,720
now that everybody's on board

633
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,039
right

634
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,960
we want to keep the workflow going so

635
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,360
with this the question is who will do

636
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,679
what and how can a continuous workflow

637
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,120
be achieved

638
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,640
as i already mentioned with the team

639
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,320
planner

640
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,240
besides the calendar we want to have a

641
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,000
task planner and tracker

642
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,880
so we kind of know what is still to do

643
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,799
for what are we still waiting

644
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,760
uh what has to be done and to keep

645
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
control over this this would be

646
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,200
some of one of the tasks that the

647
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
incident manager should regularly check

648
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,400
on

649
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,120
and to keep the workflow continuously it

650
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,880
is really important to continuously

651
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,640
share your results this is also where

652
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,400
the shared workplace comes in handy

653
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,640
because then you can easily see this

654
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,280
it's all helpful to give the other teams

655
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,679
you know

656
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,880
and non-secure heads up maybe in a chat

657
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,360
it doesn't have to include any

658
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,240
information

659
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,400
it's enough to ping there's new

660
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,240
information and then the person can

661
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,320
look it up but just to keep this

662
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,919
workflow going just to keep the

663
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,880
communication going even so you might be

664
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,080
in really different places right now

665
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,200
so it is also important to react and to

666
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,760
always

667
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,480
uh you know let the other one know yes

668
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,200
you're still

669
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,640
on on board uh what also helps is to

670
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,039
have regular conference calls

671
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,480
and um to also differentiate between

672
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,200
status and

673
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,159
technical call because then it is very

674
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,840
targeted towards the

675
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,400
the persons that are in charge of this

676
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,720
because maybe a managerial call

677
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,919
is not very interesting for the techies

678
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,679
and vice versa and so you might want to

679
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,679
differentiate this so nobody's actually

680
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,760
bored during those conference calls

681
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,880
and um also quite important

682
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,280
is to really openly and timely

683
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,120
communicate if there is any other

684
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,799
business maybe a national case that

685
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,159
might interfere

686
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,159
because if you just drop out without

687
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,559
telling the others this is really a big

688
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,799
cause of frustration and just to

689
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,840
communicate

690
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,720
communicate this openly makes it so much

691
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,880
easier to plan and then to also plan how

692
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,080
the team can get

693
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,879
back on board

694
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,039
so we do have some more uh questions

695
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,240
is that a five minute five minutes

696
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,120
remaining

697
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,200
okay great we will make that um

698
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,720
so the question is what kind of

699
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,480
documentation reports are we

700
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,360
required um i'll make it a bit faster

701
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,080
right now

702
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,960
so maybe the important point is that you

703
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,640
want to do this right away because it's

704
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,559
made way more cumbersome to do it at the

705
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,760
end and to remember

706
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,240
everything that happened and also if law

707
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,080
enforcement is involved it might be

708
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,080
required for evidence collection to have

709
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,480
a gapless timeline

710
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,559
also consider any potential legal

711
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,080
impediments especially

712
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,440
for example in the light of the gdpr

713
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,279
so always keep the data protection

714
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,960
officer informed and

715
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,840
involved finally what are potential

716
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,279
cultural differences

717
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,600
and maybe personal issues so i already

718
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,520
mentioned a lot of them throughout the

719
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,799
entire presentation and um so the

720
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,120
incident manager is probably the person

721
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
the key person in this case

722
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,600
who um you should always use as a

723
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,720
mediator

724
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,440
to act uh in in cases of personal

725
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,159
frictions or

726
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,360
cultural frictions and to even be better

727
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,080
in this task it might be handy to send

728
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,600
the incident managers to intercultural

729
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,960
competence training

730
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,720
because then they are even better

731
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,679
prepared for cases like this

732
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,000
and finally how is the media involved in

733
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,200
the case

734
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,600
this is basically just a plea that the

735
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,520
involved teams should align their media

736
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,320
strategy

737
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,720
because it's not very good if one team

738
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,760
for example

739
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,000
um spoils everything to the media

740
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,360
whereas the other team in the other

741
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,120
country is completely closed about

742
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,760
giving information out so just align

743
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,120
this in one way so you can

744
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,159
all follow the same media strategy so

745
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,080
this brings us to phase five

746
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,520
the remediation and closure of the case

747
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,919
this is you know the cleanup after the

748
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,240
party it's not the most popular part

749
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,080
everybody already wants to go home

750
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,720
basically but it's also great

751
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,919
adds great value so

752
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,000
um we want to talk about the outcome of

753
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,039
the case this is

754
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,799
something that michael um already

755
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,400
mentioned at the beginning it was

756
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,799
really unclear in this case so just make

757
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,640
sure that you know what you want at the

758
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,120
end

759
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
so maybe for example a shared final

760
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,720
report or any other kind of

761
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,760
outcome think of how you can improve on

762
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,720
the case

763
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,679
don't do any finger pointing or bashing

764
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,440
but try to really learn

765
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,840
and critically reflect on the case and

766
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,760
try to find a structured plan for

767
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,799
implementing the suggestions and maybe

768
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,240
also share what you've learned with

769
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,919
other teams so they can learn from your

770
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,159
best practices

771
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,799
and talking about sharing finally

772
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,360
information sharing with other

773
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,440
not involved third parties for example

774
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,279
in trusted communities

775
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,799
just make sure to find an agreement upon

776
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,720
the scope and level of detail

777
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,039
if you have to anonymize the data and

778
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,880
maybe also the glp level

779
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,240
what you can share and with whom so this

780
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,440
brings us to the

781
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,480
actual final point the extra burst

782
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,799
which is the german term for just a

783
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,320
little bit extra

784
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
and i won't go into really much detail

785
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,640
here um it is an attachment of

786
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,600
our document and it's just a very

787
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
special case if the you know tlp

788
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,080
protocol etc is just not enough and

789
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,760
gives you a lot of hints on what to

790
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,640
consider if you have this special case

791
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,960
so with this this brings me to my final

792
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,120
slide this is the eye to hop paper

793
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,200
it will be publicly available soon as a

794
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
tlp-wide version

795
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,440
it is already available on request and

796
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,799
talking about all the food

797
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,640
please do not confuse our eye to help

798
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,399
paper with the international house of

799
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,000
pancakes or ihop

800
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,240
this is not a commercial thank you

801
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,799
thank you edition and michael two quick

802
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,520
questions

803
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,559
uh in one minute each at most

804
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,200
have you applied the the model to real

805
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,399
case already

806
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,000
and what were the experience and that's

807
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,600
a question from kyoto

808
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,960
yeah we have not really uh applied it in

809
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,520
the whole

810
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,080
to our international cases of course

811
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,279
some of the aspects

812
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,039
of what are in now we try to already

813
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,880
a follow when we are working with other

814
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,159
teams

815
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,200
but we plan when we now have large uh

816
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,559
international cases

817
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,320
to apply this model and maybe at the

818
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,200
next uh

819
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,440
conference or when we met i can talk

820
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,799
about how it's worked out

821
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,159
i think it was also a bit because of

822
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,919
corona that we didn't actually

823
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,080
go other places this year so much where

824
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,360
we could apply it fully

825
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,799
and another question from an anonymous

826
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,840
attendee

827
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,480
who is working in a multi military

828
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,360
vendor

829
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,440
based in the u.s and has been involved

830
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,520
in cross-country incidents

831
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,919
and he struggled on how to engage with

832
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,080
the right international resources

833
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,320
especially when he wasn't the the actual

834
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,200
victim

835
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,039
so how does your international

836
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,120
coordination factor

837
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,799
in multinational concerns when you

838
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,120
these are not countries do you have any

839
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,080
experience on that

840
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,919
or any intern to extend your model

841
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,240
so if it's basically one company that

842
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,159
has subsidiaries in different countries

843
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,000
did i get that right

844
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,760
yeah we actually do consider that in our

845
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,559
paper it

846
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,760
it is basically a bit different towards

847
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,120
what we just presented but um we we

848
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,320
already considered it

849
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,399
um that it's one case where you have

850
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,559
different companies or um

851
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,360
you know governmental institutions but

852
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,840
also the case where we have one

853
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,520
like headquarter and then a subsidiary

854
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
in a different country and we do mention

855
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,640
that in a case study

856
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,840
