imagine we are busy

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,280
both from a research perspective and

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,360
from a cyber perspective

33
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,000

by brandon grimes who is the chief of

44
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,600
the industrial control systems group

45
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,880
under the caesars

46
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,079

my name is brandon grimes and i am uh

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,320
the deputy chief of the ics section i'm

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,799
actually

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,000
currently serving in a role as a uh as

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,759
an engagement lead for incident response

58
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,280
versus a right now

59
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,439

floor over to you but he leads most of

61
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:07,439
our

62
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,440
research and development for ics

63
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,040
yeah correct i help with a couple other

64
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,640
projects overseas various

65
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,680
work we do for research and capabilities

66
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,200
and

67
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,400
malware analysis and stuff like that

68
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,920
yep and so what we're going to be

69
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,440
talking to you guys today about is

70
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,239
is really the physical consequences from

71
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,760
from cyber attacks you know

72
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,280
obviously talking about industrial

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,239
control systems specific cyber attacks

74
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,840
and we're actually going to be using the

75
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,640
miter attack for ics framework to do so

76
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,879
and really focusing on that impact

77
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,200
tactic to uh to demonstrate the physical

78
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,720
consequence

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,519
so who are we um we are the nation's

80
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,959
risk advisors so

81
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,480
in the united states um almost 90

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,080
of critical infrastructure is actually

83
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,599
private owned and operated

84
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,680
and based on the various sectors and

85
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,000
regulatory agencies and authorities

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,319
um it's not always a clean match in

87
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,440
terms of

88
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,800
you know the government the private

89
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,640
sector working together so sis

90
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,920
is very um um i guess

91
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,680
i would say passively involved in the

92
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
sense that we don't do as much

93
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,280
direct support like the hunt and

94
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,560
incident response that our team

95
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,920
specifically does

96
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,159
we're kind of in the minority so we

97
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,920
really try to advise and get involved

98
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,760
with the community and try to uh try to

99
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,040
move the needle forward that way

100
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,920
just gonna skip through these uh these

101
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,760
stock slides that the external affairs

102
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,920
folks make us add so yes um

103
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,000
essentially we we have um we have

104
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
several responsibilities

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,760
but we do work with the public and the

106
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,280
private sector to do uh

107
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,840
various cyber security services

108
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,319
there

109
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,400
all right the worldwide threat

110
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,680
assessment

111
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,239
uh russia remains pretty much our our

112
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,640
biggest adversary

113
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,040
they're kind of the most capable of any

114
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
other countries

115
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,280
the most talent hardest to to follow and

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,879
such

117
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,200
so obviously we're going to keep our

118
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,640
eyes on them for

119
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,680
years to come china they're

120
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,959
about as powerful in previous years

121
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,639
they used to do a lot of there's still a

122
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,000
lot of

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,840
intellectual property but they've

124
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,199
progressed over

125
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,320
on a recent years and become a little

126
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,680
more of a

127
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,000
threat in the sense that they want to

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,040
cause destruction

129
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,840
kind of like russia potentially would

130
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,720
and then

131
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,759
iran they have a lot of

132
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,520
want and their capabilities are growing

133
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,720
they also have highly malicious intent

134
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,759
not just stealing intellectual property

135
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,560
and north korea they mostly steal

136
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,040
intellectual property

137
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,600
and there's lots of different reports in

138
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,479
recent years

139
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,400
that uh that either we have put out or

140
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,759
even

141
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,759
antivirus companies that have tracked

142
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,440
some of their activities so

143
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,360
if you wanna you can pretty much find

144
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,479
reports on about any of these countries

145
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,759
that are out there and publicly

146
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,000
available on the internet

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,280
non-state actors a lot of those tend to

148
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,600
be

149
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,960
more uh crime wear and such and a little

150
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,320
bit later in the slides

151
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,360
we will discuss some of the activities

152
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,639
that go on with the non-state actors

153
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,440
back to you brandon

154
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,400
so before we start talking about um

155
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,320
these industrial control systems attacks

156
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,240
i just want to touch on the purdue

157
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,199
reference model

158
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,120
real quick for those of you who aren't

159
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,039
as familiar with control systems

160
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,840
so you have um basically from layers

161
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,039
five to zero

162
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,880
and it descends um basically how close

163
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,639
going from five to zero how close you

164
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,319
are to the actual physical process or

165
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,680
how close the component

166
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,319
or information system or physical system

167
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,000
is is to the fiscal process

168
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,360
so um the purdue model is kind of

169
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,880
showing its age though

170
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,520
generally we've referred and seen um you

171
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,240
know i.t

172
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,160
and operational technology or ics

173
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
segmentation at around that layer three

174
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
level

175
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,520
but that's not necessarily a given um if

176
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
you have an entirely flat network

177
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,840
or if you're leveraging cloud resources

178
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,520
or industrial iot

179
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,400
this can get very murky so um just

180
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,440
understand that

181
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,639
basically the true ics

182
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,360
uh in air quotes the items or

183
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,960
information systems that are actually

184
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,880
controlling the physical process or

185
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,080
telling things to move

186
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,880
or open or breakers to open or close

187
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,560
that's going to really be from layers

188
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,280
three to

189
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,560
zero and uh the miter attacker ics

190
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,199
framework actually starts on layer two

191
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,599
there are also a number of integrated

192
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,880
systems that might have

193
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
some level of control like a distributed

194
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,800
control system or supervisory control

195
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,840
and data acquisition or scada

196
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,840
these sorts of systems can kind of

197
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,520
transcend that layer two

198
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,280
all the way down to layer one and layer

199
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
zero and often times these are the

200
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,319
typical

201
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,919
windows-based systems that might be

202
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,039
running on windows server 2000 or 2003

203
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,520
or xp so these are the systems that can

204
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,360
can really hold your fate and both help

205
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,280
you and hurt you from a

206
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,759
defensive perspective you know as you're

207
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,360
defending your network or if an

208
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,599
adversary penetrates your network so

209
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,880
most of the activity we're going to be

210
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,280
talking about are really on these

211
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,840
layer 2 and integrated dcs and scada

212
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,639
systems

213
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,800
where adversaries have caused a physical

214
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,919
impact from a cyber attack

215
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,240
the next slide is the minor ics attack

216
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,720
framework or attack or ics framework

217
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,879
um i'm not going to spend too much time

218
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,000
on this you know

219
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,919
it's a big chart i just want to note

220
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,360
that it does

221
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,319
mesh with attack for enterprise i.t it

222
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,000
does not replace it

223
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,879
so essentially the the best thing to do

224
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,560
when you're talking about

225
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,199
the full attack lifestyle in a holistic

226
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:03,919
man or

227
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,160
the full attack life cycle excuse me in

228
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,440
a holistic manner

229
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,680
is really you want to integrate attack

230
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,479
for it

231
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,520
and then ics attack as well um we're not

232
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,039
doing that in the slide deck just for

233
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,879
the sake of time we're going to focus on

234
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,120
post exploitation activity and then

235
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,240
really just

236
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,560
just the ics to walk through the the

237
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,080
attacks themselves so

238
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,560
i just know there's a good blog from

239
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,759
fire and mandy that might have

240
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,560
contributed

241
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,280
to it as well uh that talks about the

242
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,719
integration of the two just now that

243
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,399
there's some overlap and they're

244
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,000
they're complementary of each other but

245
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,039
they're not replacements

246
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,399
so now we're going to talk about a few

247
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,039
case studies

248
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,399
so the first case study we're going to

249
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,880
talk about is actually from this year

250
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,839
april of this year over the israeli

251
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,080
independence holiday in late april

252
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,839
they experienced a number of cyber

253
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,680
attacks in

254
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,000
mostly agricultural areas um very

255
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
geographically disparate systems that

256
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,399
were controlling

257
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,519
mostly just water flow control and

258
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,320
sewage

259
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,320
systems um essentially what happened was

260
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,480
the uh the operators noticed a

261
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,399
disruption something wasn't

262
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,640
acting right and actually looked closer

263
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,160
at some of the systems and they found

264
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
that a number of their internet

265
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,160
connected systems were compromised

266
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,240
um they weren't compromised in any

267
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,760
sophisticated activity

268
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,440
we're talking systems that either had

269
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,600
default credentials and a web interface

270
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,800
to log into

271
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,080
or no authentication at all

272
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,800
what the attackers then did is they

273
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,399
exploited these systems

274
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,360
they did the um

275
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,440
reconnaissance probably through a system

276
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,200
like showdown

277
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
and then they actually changed the

278
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,720
ladder logic on the system

279
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,760
now depending on the vendor um line that

280
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,440
was affected you either need

281
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,120
standard vendor software like uh win cc

282
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,839
for siemens or factory top for rockwell

283
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,680
allen bradley where you actually draw

284
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,440
out your logic and talk about what the

285
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,040
system's going to do

286
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,640
so what the attackers did is they pulled

287
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,240
the project file that holds all this

288
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,440
logic off

289
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,079
and they essentially changed set points

290
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:14,880
so

291
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,760
set points are this pump is going to run

292
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,160
at

293
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,800
this specific speed if the pressure is

294
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,399
you know this psi

295
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,360
or if the flow is you know this specific

296
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,079
seat

297
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,160
or speed or pressure i'm going to open

298
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,320
this valve to this certain degree

299
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,120
um so they didn't cause any damage but

300
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,120
they did cause a disruption

301
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,200
um so no loss of control no loss of

302
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,240
safety no big

303
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,200
boom um but this was very much a sort of

304
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,279
a smash and grab job if you will that

305
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:43,680
these

306
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,959
these systems were targets of

307
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,279
opportunity and then they were impacted

308
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,279
so ransomware um we could probably talk

309
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,279
all day about ransomware truthfully or

310
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,959
all morning or afternoon wherever you

311
00:10:58,959 --> 00:10:59,600
are

312
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
it's very active and we're seeing it

313
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,959
more and more in control systems

314
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,240
networks as well

315
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,560
so going back to the purdue model um

316
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,600
even even

317
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,680
mature organizations that have network

318
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,040
segmentation

319
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,120
they do have slip ups in the sense that

320
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,079
their network's not

321
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,320
completely segmented or they have an

322
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,079
integrated active directory

323
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,640
or they have access control list or dmz

324
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,519
but they're allowing

325
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,720
you know 3389 which is rdp across

326
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,880
and adversaries are moving laterally to

327
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,720
that um

328
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,600
we had a specific case study uh where a

329
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,640
pipeline

330
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,399
compressor station was ransomware but

331
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,920
there also have been a number of

332
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,720
international case studies as well

333
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,760
you know locker goga megacortex

334
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,079
and also the snake ecken snake hose

335
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,519
ransomware that actually has the

336
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,800
capability to

337
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,000
shut down industrial processes um but

338
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,399
not

339
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,320
encrypt the entire system and

340
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,920
essentially brick it like

341
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,880
you know a locker goga did um which was

342
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,240
very disruptive

343
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,720
uh the specific case study that we have

344
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,399
and there's there's a link to it as well

345
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,360
um you can find it with a quick google

346
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,079
um essentially uh the typical sphere

347
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,519
phishing attachment

348
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,720
um external remote services uh

349
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,760
like smb and rdp were available from the

350
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,279
i.t segment of the network to the

351
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,360
operational technology segment of the

352
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,160
network and just about all the window

353
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,959
systems

354
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,560
were ransomware this caused a denial of

355
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,399
view and a loss of availability but i

356
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,079
want to highlight that it didn't deny

357
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,800
control

358
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
and it didn't cause a loss of control

359
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,240
that's because these lower

360
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,560
layer devices like a programmable logic

361
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,519
controller

362
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,800
or an rtu those systems that actually

363
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,959
have the logic uploaded to them

364
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,399
they were not affected because they were

365
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,560
not windows-based systems however

366
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,200
the systems that were monitoring this

367
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,279
for safety and control purposes

368
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,120
they were adversely affected so what

369
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,560
they decided to do even though

370
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,000
everything was still running properly

371
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,839
but they couldn't validate or review it

372
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,839
it shut everything down restore from

373
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,360
backup and they had to revalidate the

374
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,880
entire physical process

375
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,440
took about two and a half days so a lot

376
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,880
of time an effort was wasted there

377
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,200
there okay

378
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,959
black energy we've presented on this

379
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,440
numerous times over the years

380
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,639
it may not be as used

381
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,800
today but it's still very important to

382
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,600
talk about because

383
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,360
when we do assessments and such there's

384
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,839
still locations that

385
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,959
may not be patched and fully up to date

386
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,079
on stuff

387
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,120
and could still be vulnerable to even

388
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,480
reusing black energy again

389
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,720
when everything started up we found

390
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
traces of the malware that

391
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,079
dated back to at least 2011

392
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,279
the campaign that went on

393
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,920
pretty much compromised hundreds of

394
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,079
systems worldwide

395
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,199
and then dozens in the u.s

396
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,920
in most cases they were internet facing

397
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,720
devices

398
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,680
uh so they weren't segmented and deep

399
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,560
down

400
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,360
in networks they were really easy to

401
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,720
access

402
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,440
and so the malware didn't have to

403
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,959
actually find its way through a system

404
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,320
the threat actors didn't have to find

405
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,240
their way through the systems

406
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,279
they simply were able to locate

407
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,320
uh hmis that were facing the internet

408
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,360
and then uh exploit at that time zero

409
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,519
day vulnerabilities

410
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,680
um since then obviously most of those

411
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,800
are patched

412
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,880
and derek i i just want to add to that

413
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,079
too so

414
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,839
what's what's important about black

415
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,440
energy is it actually

416
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,120
exploited ics software on the device so

417
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,480
it targeted a few specific vendor lines

418
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,360
many of which are ubiquitous in the us

419
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,199
and really just the west in general

420
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,600
but it actually was ics specific malware

421
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,120
in the in the sense that it

422
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,519
it leveraged a vulnerability in object

423
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,959
linking and embedding so

424
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,079
very similar to uh some of the the

425
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,279
old office macro vulnerabilities um

426
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,399
in terms of the plumbing so um

427
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,560
in the dark gray here in the slide deck

428
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,240
these are the actual

429
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,360
um case studies where

430
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,920
we saw black energy doing this activity

431
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,000
um but at its heart black energy was a

432
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,600
reconnaissance tool

433
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,199
a remote access trojan that's really

434
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,360
what black energy 3.0 was but it's

435
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,480
highly modular

436
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,000
and then the light gray these are some

437
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,399
of the capabilities that black energy

438
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,880
could have had so black energy very

439
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,800
easily could have disrupted the physical

440
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,360
process

441
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,000
just based on that very small beach head

442
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,360
that we observed

443
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,639
and internet exposed devices yep

444
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,959
correct yeah being modular you could

445
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,560
pretty much build on about anything you

446
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,320
wanted and

447
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,079
so you have black energy make the

448
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,000
initial connection and access to

449
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,560
the system and then you can load up any

450
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,800
other modules and have it take

451
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,440
steps to do anything you can imagine

452
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,480
pretty much after that

453
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,680
whatever you have access to do

454
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,519
i think that covers that slide pretty

455
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,240
well so back to you for ukraine

456
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,720
thanks all right so the ukraine 2015

457
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,639
attack in in my opinion this is

458
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,480
this is one of the most important ones

459
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,639
and often under talked about because it

460
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,720
caused a really long disruption

461
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,839
um the asset owners were first are

462
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,079
forced to revert to manual operations

463
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:26,480
for

464
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,959
for several months so essentially here's

465
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,079
what we do know

466
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,000
um and there's a lot that we don't just

467
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,440
because there was uh

468
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,519
kill this role in destroying a lot of

469
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,480
artifacts

470
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,120
um so we don't have good data on a lot

471
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,680
of the

472
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,440
reconnaissance discovery lateral

473
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
movement and really weaponization of

474
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,399
this attack

475
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,000
but what we do know is in 2015 there was

476
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,160
a large-scale fishing campaign

477
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,759
all throughout ukraine targeting a

478
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,399
number of services it's well documented

479
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,720
and we know that black energy was that

480
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,480
black energy 3.0

481
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,399
which was not ics specific malware but

482
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,519
really just a remote access trojan

483
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,599
black energy iii probably got that

484
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,720
initial foothold

485
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,599
and actually got the valid credentials

486
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,839
from there the adversaries did pivot to

487
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,359
the industrial network which was

488
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,599
segmented but they used

489
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,720
valid vpn and regular enterprise i.t

490
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,559
credentials to then penetrate the ot

491
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,240
portion of the network

492
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,240
from there they use living off the lan

493
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,319
techniques and regular vendor software

494
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,960
so we're talking like really just an

495
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
elevated command prompt and using things

496
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,440
like

497
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,960
net use and ipconfig to just enumerate

498
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,039
the network the various systems

499
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,960
and then drop their various tools on the

500
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,880
devices when they actually

501
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,520
cut or started to open up the breakers

502
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,080
to

503
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,160
shut the proverbial lights off and open

504
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,280
the circuits

505
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,080
to remove the flow of electricity they

506
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,280
um they use remote

507
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,840
desktop access so just an internal

508
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,120
microsoft tool

509
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,440
there's actually uh some videos floating

510
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,240
around where

511
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,880
the operator is fighting with the

512
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,160
russian operator

513
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,919
over the mouse as they're clicking

514
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,919
breakers open and shutting down these

515
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,120
circuits

516
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,840
once they opened up these breakers they

517
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,000
deployed kill discs to then kill these

518
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,480
hmis that had the control and then they

519
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,799
launched a denial of service

520
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,880
from the serial to ip converters that

521
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,640
actually were used

522
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,840
most of these um ics devices

523
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,320
specifically in the electric sector

524
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,400
and electric relays use a lot of serial

525
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,600
technology

526
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,320
so we use serial ip because zero only

527
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:32,720
has

528
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,559
you know say a hundred meter cable run

529
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,960
at most um so they use serial ip

530
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,919
converters

531
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,679
to basically talk to the various

532
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,960
substations

533
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,360
and they use the denial of service to

534
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,120
kind of blow those bridges

535
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,320
um and deny communication so luckily

536
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,600
uh the ukrainians had a willingness to

537
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,919
revert to manual operations send out the

538
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,080
various operators to the substations and

539
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,360
start manually

540
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,039
closing the breakers to restore the flow

541
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,280
of electricity but they were forced in

542
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,520
manual operations for as much to six

543
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,639
months in some places

544
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,080
now ukraine 2016 was was very different

545
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,240
in the sense that they went up one level

546
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,200
so at the distribution level electricity

547
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,880
that's sort of the lowest level of the

548
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,799
pyramid and that's where you see

549
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,720
all of these various substations and the

550
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,320
levels above that that manage

551
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,280
substations to get electricity into

552
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,240
individual buildings and homes and areas

553
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,400
at the larger scale we have electric

554
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,679
transmission so

555
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,760
when electric is generated at a power

556
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,360
plant it then goes to

557
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,240
electric through electric transmission

558
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,559
uh

559
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,160
systems to actually get to the

560
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,760
individual substations

561
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,600
so this is sort of a step above that

562
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,080
right this is these are the power lines

563
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,039
uh that you see that are very large and

564
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:49,600
you can

565
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
essentially they have a highway under

566
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,640
them

567
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,760
cleared trees throughout so larger scale

568
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,520
electricity here

569
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,160
and this specific attack was targeted at

570
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,880
an area

571
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,320
that was very automated this was the

572
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,559
crash override or in destroyer malware

573
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,640
that's that's often been talked about

574
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,960
and it was highly modular the big

575
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,320
takeaways here is

576
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,000
yes this malware is extremely

577
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,520
sophisticated and then

578
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,200
it was also very modular so it targeted

579
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,600
very specific protocols and very

580
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,240
specific

581
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,360
items the other big takeaway here is

582
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,919
most of the adversary's effect was again

583
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,520
used off of living off the land

584
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,000
techniques to get the data to weaponize

585
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,600
the attack

586
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,520
we were very lucky here in the sense

587
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,039
that several of these modules because

588
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,799
they weren't actually the protocols

589
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,720
weren't actually written to spec

590
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,640
they failed so the ciprotec ddos attack

591
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,720
for example um

592
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,480
that failed because the the ip was

593
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,039
encoded

594
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,559
wrongly in the attack code so it

595
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,400
actually came out transposed

596
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
so they didn't actually hit the target

597
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,320
this would have sent the device into a

598
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,520
firmware update

599
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,919
and then that protective relay would not

600
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:04,559
have

601
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,840
been able to balance the flow of

602
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,880
electricity as items were restored

603
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,720
the targeting was much larger but

604
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,400
because several protocols

605
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,559
and attack modules were not implemented

606
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,440
to spec

607
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,480
it actually did fail luckily enough um

608
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,679
kildisc again did have a role here or

609
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,600
not necessarily kill this but the wiper

610
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,039
module of this malware

611
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,200
had a more destructive role and then

612
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,240
also the

613
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,679
um the iec 101 module did deploy

614
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,799
correctly so

615
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,520
we did see some localized outages but it

616
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,360
could have been much worse

617
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,880
if some of these other attack modules

618
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,080
would have done their job correctly so

619
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,440
sort of dodged a bullet here

620
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,360
proverbially but could have been much

621
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,159
worse could have

622
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,840
resulted in a loss of safety or an

623
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,679
actual damaging of equipment

624
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,840
as a larger scale outage uncontrolled

625
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,400
restorations um

626
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,760
and then other other systems that

627
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,039
balance the power and the flow of

628
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,240
electricity on the grid

629
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,480
being a firmware update could have

630
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,840
caused uh

631
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,439
more serious damage but did not

632
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,039
all right triton trices and hat man um

633
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,840
hatman is what we called it triton and

634
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,559
trisis

635
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,799
are the other names that you can find

636
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,360
public reports on as well

637
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,559
all the reports go highly in depth

638
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,080
to all the specifics behind the malware

639
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,799
it was one of probably the most

640
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,520
sophisticated pieces of malware we've

641
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,960
dealt with simply because

642
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,240
you know with black energy it was

643
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,559
compromising hmis

644
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,960
you can use it even just as a trojan and

645
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,280
get access to systems

646
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,000
but even if you compromise those systems

647
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,880
and start

648
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,120
you know manipulating an hmi telling

649
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,799
things to open close

650
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,640
you still have those safety systems that

651
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
could potentially cover you

652
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,320
with triton trices hatman

653
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
it basically compromised the safety

654
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,440
systems

655
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,559
so that they wouldn't respond correctly

656
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,760
um you could potentially tell that

657
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,360
system to

658
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,200
allow any um access any actions through

659
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,000
it

660
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,320
so once you compromise it then you use

661
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,039
an hmi

662
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,360
or whatnot and tell the system to

663
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,039
over spin and potentially

664
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,600
blow up equipment and the safety system

665
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,360
normally would know these different base

666
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,400
lines

667
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,200
and help protect the system but if you

668
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,159
tell it not to

669
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,919
then obviously it's just going to allow

670
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,320
anything through

671
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,960
and for the most part it also would make

672
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,880
it to where even the

673
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,400
operators aren't seeing things happening

674
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,799
you could have it lie back to the

675
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,039
operators

676
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,679
initially when it was discovered it was

677
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,400
because

678
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,640
it had a flaw in the programming

679
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,080
and the triconx tricon system

680
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,240
is highly sensitive on timing

681
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,960
all of the operations happen fairly

682
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,880
slowly through it and there's specific

683
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,760
timing to it

684
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,960
and the malware initially

685
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,080
pushed uh its exploit

686
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,279
too fast and it ended up crashing the

687
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:29,919
system

688
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,200
so the company discovered something was

689
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,840
going on

690
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,520
you know their system safety system went

691
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,880
offline

692
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,200
they started looking through things had

693
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,440
the manufacturer come over

694
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,480
and that's when they found the malware

695
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,200
we are positive that in very short time

696
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,480
the threat actor

697
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,520
fixed the malware and uh could

698
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,559
be using it because once we got

699
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,720
samples of the malware it didn't take us

700
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,000
too long to

701
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,480
fix it and make it work without even

702
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
being able to see it

703
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,279
so again highly sophisticated because

704
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,679
there was no way to even

705
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,200
notice that malware being activated

706
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,480
or even find it on the system so we

707
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,960
worked with the manufacturer

708
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,600
and at one of their facilities and kind

709
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,360
of found out some

710
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,200
ways that they could use their devices

711
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,720
and different uh

712
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,679
testing equipment to potentially see if

713
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,520
that malware's on the system

714
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,559
um but this was extremely

715
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,720
uh important step in the evolution of

716
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,240
the malware for ics

717
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,039
because it is you know when you take the

718
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,120
safety system offline it's just

719
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,279
you can have catastrophic events if you

720
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,400
wanted to

721
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
yeah and i i would just want to add in

722
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,919
there as well um

723
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,159
when you're actually causing a physical

724
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,000
impact these systems are designed to

725
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,840
fail in a safe state

726
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,880
so say a water line is is

727
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,640
ready to go to a certain degree or

728
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,440
pressurized tank for example

729
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,679
the safety systems are that additional

730
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,720
safety net and

731
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,640
and really the implication on this

732
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,559
malware

733
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,120
triton crisis hatman is is essentially

734
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,039
how you make a plant go boom

735
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,600
um if a pipeline compressor station for

736
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,120
example gets ransomware

737
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,440
and some sort of physical event happens

738
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,960
and we lose all control

739
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,640
a safe failure would still be something

740
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,400
called a blow down where a big fireball

741
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,919
shoots up and it's actually

742
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,880
a controlled failure exploiting the

743
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,760
safety system

744
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,159
prevents a control failure from possibly

745
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:32,960
happening

746
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,559
and that's how you cause damage or

747
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,000
potentially loss of life

748
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,320
and the specific victim being a very

749
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,480
large petrochemical facility

750
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,480
uh could have absolutely released

751
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,880
noxious gases or dangerous gases and

752
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,679
then also

753
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,320
you know potentially cause some sort of

754
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,720
uh

755
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,559
bigger explosion yep

756
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,120
that is our presentation i know we ran

757
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,679
through things

758
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,279
quickly just for the sake of time um

759
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,520
i think we do have a couple questions

760
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,440
that we can go ahead and answer that

761
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,640
came in

762
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,840
in the question yes indeed so thank you

763
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,640
for your

764
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,600
presentation uh before we start the q a

765
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,799
let me add something

766
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,799
uh you have uh i would like to comment

767
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,799
that you have a very useful ics portal

768
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,840
on the

769
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,640
uscert.caesar.gov and

770
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,720
i'll put that in the chat and i highly

771
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,480
recommend that on this to have a look at

772
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,039
it

773
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,120
so some question now the first one is

774
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,240
from

775
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,600
stein bonkras is is it still called

776
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,640
segmentation

777
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,000
when you can just vpn into that segment

778
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,880
um in a lot of places it's still called

779
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,679
an air gap

780
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,720
um even even when you can rdp and

781
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,279
um it's very contextual i don't want to

782
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,840
sit here and say that

783
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,000
um don't vpn don't have network

784
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,520
segmentation there are a lot of

785
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,320
legitimate

786
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,720
business cases specifically in

787
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,640
manufacturing for example where they

788
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:56,960
have

789
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,880
just in time ordering or they need to

790
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,480
keep track of

791
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,039
various chemicals or materials to track

792
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:03,679
their cost

793
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,039
and their output so there are many

794
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,000
use cases to do so it's really just

795
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
finding that sweet spot between

796
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
enabling the business and then having

797
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,760
detection and response or compensating

798
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,880
controls to

799
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,320
prevent malicious activity from

800
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
happening or if you can't prevent it

801
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,080
actually detecting it

802
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,720
in a reasonable time to respond

803
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,000
a similar question or related question

804
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,880
from anonymous attendee how does c to

805
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,559
communicate to the attacker

806
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,880
in the ics environment is not connected

807
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,799
to the internet

808
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,720
so there's um in the case of ukraine

809
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,880
2016 for example the crash override

810
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,520
malware

811
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,760
did actually have the capability to use

812
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,600
a localized proxy

813
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,760
and then they had a jump box that went

814
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,720
from the

815
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,440
ics or the jump box actually set in the

816
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,279
it network and then communicated

817
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,960
outbound so there were some hard-coded

818
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,720
credentials there

819
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,760
and other cases uh probably some sort of

820
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,480
proxy

821
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,679
or having some sort of jump box but

822
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,720
there in a lot of cases are unknown

823
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,520
connections

824
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,760
dual home devices it's really just

825
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,520
breaking that boundary if there is a

826
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,159
boundary

827
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,360
and then moving from there okay

828
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,960
another one from jens wiener

829
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
will ics targeted to run somewhere

830
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,000
become a relevant threat

831
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,720
um i i think so it's just what you

832
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
define ics targeted ransomware

833
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,080
if you look at some of the targets

834
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,720
hearing from ransomware actors or gangs

835
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,120
or crews however you refer to them

836
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,399
you'll see that the medical sector is um

837
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,080
sort of getting clobbered right now very

838
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,600
aggressively

839
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,919
we've seen similar activity uh in the

840
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,279
energy sector in the u.s

841
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,000
specifically this pipeline ransomware

842
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,799
activity

843
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,360
so i think traditional destructive

844
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,880
ransomware strains

845
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,720
are getting very close if you talk about

846
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,480
snake and ekkans actually having the

847
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,240
ability to shut down

848
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,640
these processes but you know these

849
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,520
systems are now

850
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,080
looking for ics specific processes to

851
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,559
stop

852
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,480
but not encrypt the entire directory and

853
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,760
brick the device

854
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,240
so i i think we're getting close but i

855
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,799
think

856
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,679
you'll see the medical sector um sort of

857
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,679
that iot

858
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,679
type ransomware i think that's going to

859
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,840
be the bridge before you see

860
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840
larger scale you know manufacturing

861
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,360
attacks or whatever

862
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,200
i think critical infrastructure when you

863
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,559
talk about energy and water

864
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,480
those are a little more provocative to

865
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,760
attack but i

866
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,200
i wouldn't put it past these threat

867
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,799
actors quite brazen so

868
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,760
good and the final question from uh from

869
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,480
kyoto

870
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
how do you see the development of ics

871
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,039
environment cyber security requirements

872
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,799
do you have already appropriate started

873
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,200
in place

874
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,159
it really depends on the sector um i

875
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,279
would say that

876
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,120
probably the isa 99 and 62443 standards

877
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,039
are the most robust that sort of cover

878
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,320
both the traditional enterprise and i t

879
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,519
and then also the actual ics but there

880
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,600
are a number of ways to accomplish this

881
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,760
i think it's more convincing your

882
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,360
stakeholders that these systems are

883
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,799
different because they have a different

884
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,880
life cycle they're doing a different job

885
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,039
and then putting your governance on top

886
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,720
of that because we're still not going to

887
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,559
be able to prevent every single ics

888
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,159
attack and we do have some inherent

889
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,200
vulnerabilities

890
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,039
but you can mitigate this risk in the

891
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,320
right way and it's

892
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,279
it's doing that for your organization

893
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,120
and the way that makes the most sense

894
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,880
um i work in the department of the

895
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,519
defense part-time so we have you know

896
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,200
military installations that have large

897
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,880
scale infrastructures like smart cities

898
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,760
essentially

899
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,840
and we can't just rip out every single

900
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,600
device that talks bacnet because it's

901
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,159
unauthenticated protocol we don't have

902
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,679
you know hundreds of millions of dollars

903
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:56,960
to just replace every single

904
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,679
installation

905
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,760
so you have to find that sweet spot that

906
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,679
makes sense for your organization

907
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,080
and not necessarily you have to find a

908
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,240
standard or a framework that aligns but

909
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,519
you can't necessarily be

910
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,720
married to any one standard of framework

911
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,000
okay and a final one most

912
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
ics equipment cannot be installed with

913
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,279
endpoint security

914
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,080
software such as edr or others so what

915
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,880
would be the

916
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,360
the practical way to monitor security in

917
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,600
the ics world

918
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,159
in my opinion you get the most value

919
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,399
from a robust security baseline

920
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,240
just because most industrial control

921
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,159
systems are trying to maintain

922
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,399
a state so they're trying to do the same

923
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,679
thing over and over they're trying to

924
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,519
keep a building to a certain temperature

925
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,000
they're trying to keep power flowing or

926
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,919
they're trying to keep water flowing or

927
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,080
batch chemical process whatever so that

928
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,919
network traffic is going to be very very

929
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,519
normalized and if you look at

930
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,200
specifically like these ukraine attacks

931
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,120
and also triton trisis hatman

932
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,880
there are a lot of opportunities for the

933
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,640
defender to catch the adversary with

934
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,399
unauthorized connections

935
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,399
um so i think monitoring detection

936
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,919
response here are really key to

937
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,279
preventing these attacks

938
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,640
or at least addressing them because

939
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,360
in order to you know affect an ics style

940
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,159
you know true

941
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,120
impact the adversary has to weaponize an

942
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,840
attack

943
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,240
and they have to do so with large-scale

944
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,679
reconnaissance and then they have to

945
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,840
pre-stage their tools as well so

946
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,519
there's a lot of opportunities to catch

947
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,039
the adversary

948
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,840
i don't think edr on a plc is is going

949
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,440
to get you a whole lot of value

950
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,919
but maybe sysmon on like a scada server

951
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,679
or a historian that's sort of that

952
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,279
bridge point between

953
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,840
an ics network and you know traditional

954
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,320
i.t

955
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,080
network you can get a whole lot of value

956
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,519
there or if you have

957
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,919
you know a true network boundary or dmz

958
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,519
again a ton of value and

959
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,880
net flow and firewall logs and

960
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,279
connection lots as well

961
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,760
okay as we have one more minute final

962
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,480
one

963
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,720
do you see the ics response incident

964
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,559
response readiness improving or

965
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,760
declining

966
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,360
given that multiple high-profile

967
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,200
breaches are becoming public

968
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,799
and lessons learned are being shared

969
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,799
with the ics community

970
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,080
i definitely think it's going to be um

971
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,000
moving in the right direction i i think

972
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,440
that that uh

973
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,679
entities are waking up uh specifically

974
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,359
with ransomware as well

975
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,199
i think we're detecting more attacks

976
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,800
just because ransomware is so

977
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,199
destructive it wasn't that we haven't

978
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,199
seen malware before in control systems

979
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,719
networks but until it

980
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,480
causes some sort of disruption to the

981
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,960
process uh we don't necessarily know or

982
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,800
we don't necessarily address it but now

983
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,520
that we see

984
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,359
advanced adversaries actually trying to

985
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,800
cause physical effects

986
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,960
and we also see ransomware crews causing

987
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,159
adverse impact

988
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,760
i think we can take those lessons

989
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,599
learned and then give them to

990
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,239
our individual leaderships when we're

991
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,359
talking about you know

992
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,599
what we're doing for the organization i

993
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,679
think resiliency and security is

994
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,359
supposed to be a business enabler

995
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,960
we're not supposed to be the department

996
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,839
of no nothing will get you

997
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,359
or losing more credibility on the

998
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,280
operation side of your organization

999
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,760
than impacting the physical process so

1000
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,320
don't load very heavy tools on this plc

1001
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,760
that might be vulnerable

1002
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,200
but if you're going to ingest some data

1003
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,960
maybe through cismod on there that's

1004
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,680
very uh

1005
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,000
much more passive less likely to impact

1006
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,119
something and you can get a whole lot of

1007
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,480
value out of that so

1008
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,000
i think the more we talk about these

1009
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,920
attacks the further that snowball will

1010
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,040
kind of get bigger

1011
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,720
and i think the community will grow but

1012
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,560
there's certainly certainly

1013
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,200
a long way to go before we have a robust

1014
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,839
understanding of the problem

1015
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,480
okay thank you so i'd like to thank you

1016
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,000
brandon and derek for

1017
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,920
for your great presentation and for

1018
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,920
answering the questions

1019
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,839
thanks to all of you virtual entities

1020
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,839
especially to those who ask

1021
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,079
questions i hope you enjoyed this

1022
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:40,960
