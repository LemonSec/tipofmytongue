sunday second annual first conference

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,680
today we will present the ongoing quest

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,960
for manufacturing

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,920
cyber resilient iot devices in this

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,800
session

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,439
we introduce how we as a manufacturer

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,320
try to make our iot devices resilient

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,440
against cyber attacks

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,440
before i start the session please allow

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,920
me to introduce myself briefly

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,559
i am part of the product security center

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,280
which is

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,520
responsible for product security within

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,879
panasonic

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,440
some of my previous jobs include system

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,960
development for stocks

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,680
network integration such as implementing

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,920
idf sensors etc

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,039
i joined panzonic in 2018 and i'm

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:57,760
currently

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,440
involved in iot security

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,600
let's take a look at what is happening

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,960
with iot around the world

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,360
as you probably know the number of cyber

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,000
attacks

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,119
continues to grow in 2018 over 20

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,080
thousand billion

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,920
attack packets were absorbed on the

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,680
internet moreover

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,920
about half of those observed attacks

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,880
targeted iot devices such as web cameras

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,119
routers etc what this means is that

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,759
iot devices are being targeted by

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,400
attackers

42
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,560
in addition to traditional information

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,040
systems

44
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,119
this data shows the number of malware

45
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,159
samples collected by kaspersky

46
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,320
they have been collecting iot malware

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,479
samples since 2016.

48
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,399
the number of collected samples more

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,640
than tripled from 2017

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,840
in just first half of 2018. do you

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,600
remember mirai

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,159
it was notable iot malware discovered in

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,399
september 2016.

54
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,880
since then the number of bioti malware

55
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,719
has suddenly increased

56
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,000
this is a very scary fact

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,239
so besides some of those scary numbers

58
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,160
various articles have been published

59
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,879
in the media related to iot malware and

60
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,200
the type of attacks they are causing

61
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,360
some articles provide more detail than

62
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,959
other about the attack

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,599
or the techniques used by attackers to

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,080
infect

65
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,040
large number of devices and we as

66
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,959
manufacturers want to ensure that

67
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,160
our products don't become infected if

68
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,360
our company name appear in any article

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,599
not only is this a technical risk in

70
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,840
that our products are vulnerable

71
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,319
but it also becomes that reputational

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:40,879
risk

73
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,080
in that general public we know that

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,840
our products are vulnerable thus

75
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,040
it is important for us to understand the

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,319
select landscape

77
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,720
in regards to iot devices and

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,599
proactively

79
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,480
protect our product from such attacks

80
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,200
malware

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,519
infects a large number of devices and

82
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,760
attackers use those devices to attack

83
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,720
another target in a ddos attack

84
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,800
since most of those attacks involve

85
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,239
devices for

86
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,920
which the user has no idea that they are

87
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,720
infected

88
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,120
much less known they are part of larger

89
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,800
attack we need to protect

90
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,159
our user proactively it is important for

91
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:22,560
us

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,040
manufacturers to provide devices that

93
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,680
don't get

94
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,239
infected and thus our users don't

95
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,959
unknowingly become part of such ddos

96
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,680
attacks

97
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,680
as these threats have continued to

98
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,680
increase various governments across the

99
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,840
globe have become active in creating

100
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,239
regulation through security

101
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,480
this side leaves some obligations

102
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,280
related to securing iot devices

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,360
in the united states there are some

104
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,200
federal law as well as

105
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,319
some state law to govern iot security

106
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,360
in europe the eu has put out some

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,400
regulations

108
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,959
which each of its member states are

109
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,400
implementing

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,879
and china has a nationwide cyber

111
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,680
security

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,879
to govern the entire country while japan

113
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,640
has issued some regulations as well

114
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,760
so with all that was just said how

115
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,238
can we as a manufacturer take action to

116
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,959
protect our product and users

117
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,560
this graphic shows the various

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
stakeholders that sound manufacturer

119
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,000
like pansonic

120
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,080
the important thing to note is that

121
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,440
collaboration with

122
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,680
third barrier stakeholder is necessary

123
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,960
to improve product security overall

124
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,520
one other thing that we must always keep

125
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,160
in mind

126
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,600
is that our customers will always expect

127
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
the manufacturer to ensure

128
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,160
security of its products and as

129
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,520
manufacturer

130
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,160
satisfying our customers expectation is

131
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,199
critical to our business

132
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,400
next i will introduce existing activity

133
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,160
for product security at pamphlet

134
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,400
cyber attacks are considered a major

135
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,240
corporate risk at panasonic

136
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,800
and preventing cyber attacks to protect

137
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,720
company asset is critical

138
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,600
to protect pansonic from five attacks

139
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
three main pairs have been established

140
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,800
the first on the left is i.t security

141
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,120
which focuses on securing the corporate

142
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,960
id infrastructure

143
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,199
this is a team commonly established

144
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,440
within most organizations

145
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
the other two are more unique to

146
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,919
manufacturers such as panzonic

147
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,479
skipping over to the right is factory

148
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,759
security

149
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,240
which focuses on securing the factories

150
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
and systems that manufacture

151
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,639
our product lastly in the middle of the

152
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,960
image is product security

153
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,440
which focuses on the security of various

154
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,320
products that

155
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,800
are shipped from our business unit

156
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,639
worldwide

157
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,280
the three teams collaborate on common

158
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,639
issues for example

159
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,280
sharing vulnerability information and

160
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,800
any incident response

161
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,199
that may be necessary

162
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,639
and now focusing on product security

163
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,199
all activities for product security are

164
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,400
to support the

165
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,199
panasonic brand as it is critical to

166
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,120
ensure that the user of confined

167
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,000
products can

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,720
have a peace of mind that the product is

169
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,919
safe and secure to use

170
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,319
to accomplish this there are two main

171
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,600
activities

172
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,880
minimize risk and incident response

173
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,360
the former is group of activities

174
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,240
undertaken

175
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,199
prior to shipment under later after

176
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,960
shipment

177
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,240
the base of those activities is aimed

178
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,840
to provide technical knowledge of

179
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,639
security vulnerabilities

180
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,599
and how to address them as well as

181
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,599
awareness to the development

182
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,000
team about current security trend

183
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,840
all activities for product security are

184
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,560
designed to

185
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,199
ensure security throughout the entire

186
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,800
product lifecycle

187
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,840
the green items here are for

188
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,280
pre-shipment

189
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,759
and the red item here refer to any

190
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,400
post-shipment response

191
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,960
the product security center at panasonic

192
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,440
provides support to internal developers

193
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,840
throughout the product lifecycle

194
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,080
for some of the items such as threat

195
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,880
analysis

196
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,319
and secure design we provide

197
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,520
guidelines and other supporting

198
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,799
documents for assistance

199
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,440
this shows the product security incident

200
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,680
response framework advancement

201
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,759
the pizzas cooperate with external

202
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,039
organizations such as

203
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,680
fast security vendors coordination

204
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,000
centers and academia to coordinate

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,160
any reported vulnerability in our

206
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,360
products

207
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,840
this ad has a publicly accessible

208
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,599
contact where vulnerability can be

209
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,560
reported by external stakeholders

210
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,199
once a piece has received a report

211
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,000
analysis

212
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,400
is performed to ensure that the report

213
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,160
is estimated and

214
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
there is enough information for the

215
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,080
developer to verify the reported

216
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,759
vulnerability

217
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,240
after this is done the visa will

218
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,080
distribute the report

219
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,159
to the affected division

220
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,919
as we just presented panzonic has been

221
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,840
taken various options to make our

222
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,120
products secure

223
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,640
but challenges still remain the response

224
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:34,958
to

225
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,839
those changes is the reason why we

226
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,440
started functioning

227
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,880
threat intelligence project

228
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,120
one of the main challenges is that

229
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,480
typically incident

230
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,519
responses require a trigger such as

231
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,080
internal or external notification of a

232
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,760
potential issue

233
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,920
this means incident response requires

234
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,880
vulnerability information to be reported

235
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,680
we believe that by proactively

236
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,399
collecting

237
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,279
and analyzing the first information by

238
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,480
ourselves

239
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,040
we can utilize this information to make

240
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,120
our products more secure

241
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,680
this was a concept behind the panasonic

242
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,599
iot threat intelligence project

243
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,720
this is the overview of panasonic iot

244
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,640
threat intelligence platform

245
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,959
this platform consists of three main

246
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,000
parts

247
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,720
first one is collection we have deploy a

248
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,640
honeypot to correct attack and

249
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,279
more we are targeting our products

250
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,040
second part is analysis

251
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,519
we analyze that data collected by the

252
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,959
honeypot

253
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,920
third part is protection our goal is to

254
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,560
strengthen overall iot security

255
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,440
in our product by utilizing the analysis

256
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,560
data

257
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,279
next i will provide more detail about

258
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,519
each part

259
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,399
first is collection this slide shows the

260
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,920
current progress of the

261
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,560
entire project we have two type of

262
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,920
honeypots

263
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,480
one is a software honeypot and the other

264
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,839
is actual panasonic

265
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,279
iot devices as you can see the photo on

266
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,399
the right

267
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,040
we have a showroom that displays the

268
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,480
actual products

269
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,720
the correct incoming thread to itself

270
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,360
in addition to this as a manufacturer we

271
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,000
have the

272
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,040
ability to be able to deploy product

273
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,920
in development

274
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,480
this can be big advantage because it

275
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,360
gives us

276
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
our ability to collect fat information

277
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,920
before shipment

278
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,480
we can take measure to address any newly

279
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,519
discovered vulnerability or threat

280
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,000
this is an activity that was recently

281
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,360
started

282
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,560
we currently have two observation points

283
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,920
taiwan and japan in near future

284
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,399
we plan to increase observation point

285
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,440
and include

286
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,959
us eu india airport china

287
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,079
second part is analysis the collection

288
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:04,399
of

289
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,519
malware targeting iot home appliance is

290
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,000
ongoing

291
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,720
presently we have collected many malware

292
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,440
targeting various cpu architectures

293
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,760
more detail on this will be provided

294
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,079
later in the presentation

295
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,720
we perform behavior analysis specialized

296
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
for iot malware

297
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,760
internally we have defined iot

298
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,640
malware as any malware targeting the

299
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,959
following cpu architectures

300
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,640
mips arm ark 64 ppc

301
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,800
and sh4 moreover we have automated the

302
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,079
analysis process

303
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,320
from our collection to statistical

304
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,120
analysis to reduce the amount of

305
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,200
necessary manpower

306
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,399
if we find any interesting behavior in a

307
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,200
particular

308
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,720
piece of biotin aware we will analyze

309
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,399
it more deeply by hand

310
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,000
third part is protection for us this is

311
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,560
the most

312
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,200
important phase in our quest to make our

313
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,000
product more

314
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,440
secure and resilient against attack

315
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,600
we have started to share broad attack

316
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
overview and iot malware analysis

317
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
reports to product developer

318
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,720
in this year

319
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,000
our next change is to analyze risk

320
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,440
against our products

321
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,360
include those that are under development

322
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,079
we plan to categorize and analyze attack

323
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,839
using a framework such as

324
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,120
miter attack then we will analyze

325
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,839
any targeted vulnerability against our

326
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,399
products

327
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,120
to assess countermeasures specific to

328
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,560
our product

329
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,839
finally we hope to provide this analysis

330
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,959
as helpful feedback to our developers

331
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,680
so they can utilize this feedback to

332
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,079
make

333
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,599
our product more secure

334
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,880
this is a quick summary of some data

335
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,079
points from november 2017 to june

336
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,079
2020 we have observed over 600 million

337
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,440
attacks and captured

338
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,639
56 000 malware samples

339
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,279
about 20 percent of those samples have

340
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,639
been categorized as

341
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,920
iot malware within those samples

342
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,120
we observed an interesting example

343
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
that attempts to infect a home

344
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,200
electronic device by tracing

345
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,680
myself file for the observed malware

346
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,480
after analysis it was found that the top

347
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,720
10 destination ip address

348
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,079
that they attempt to connect to were

349
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,639
malicious site and the top three

350
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,760
destination

351
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,240
countries were usa china japan

352
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,839
hi everyone i'm buling that a security

353
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,160
engineer in panasonic's cybersecurity

354
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,959
lab

355
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,440
located in taiwan i joined paris only

356
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,480
from last year

357
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,800
and in charge of part of panasonic iot

358
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,240
street intelligence

359
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,839
platform thanks for hiku jizan's

360
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,360
introduction about

361
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,680
the whole picture of the protection in

362
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,040
our company

363
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,199
next i will talk about some interesting

364
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,199
funding from our system

365
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,920
and how we can use those data to in to

366
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,360
help our developer

367
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,760
first as inches i mentioned before we

368
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,680
built an iot honeypot

369
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,800
to collect while attack during 2019 and

370
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,000
2020

371
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,480
there are many data we collect based on

372
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,880
those data we did some analyze and try

373
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,040
to find some useful information

374
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,160
for our internal use

375
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,399
there are two very interesting findings

376
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,959
we found out from the attack

377
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,839
as we all know the attack always

378
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,920
increased after a new cve come

379
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,440
out one of the peak we observe

380
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,360
is in december 2019 is the attack that

381
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,560
attacking to ms

382
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,440
sequel the attacker trying to use a weak

383
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,959
password to log in

384
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,000
and stole the malware to our system to

385
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,480
our honeypot system

386
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,760
we also observed that the msc

387
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,480
attack decreased continuously since

388
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,320
december 2019

389
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,480
from 6 million to 600 million to 0.25

390
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,440
million

391
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,000
the second peak is related to the coal

392
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,800
stranger

393
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,519
which is the upnp availability we

394
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,079
believe

395
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,040
is that attacker trying attacker or

396
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,720
research we are not sure

397
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,480
uh trying to find out what kind of

398
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,240
or which device are available for

399
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,480
this availability so there are a lot of

400
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,320
poor skin or a lot of

401
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,839
attack in this appearance

402
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,839
in april 2020 the first place is still

403
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,800
msc core however it's dropped down in

404
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,600
may

405
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,079
and in june 2020 the first place is upmp

406
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,720
from china and u.s which very makes

407
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,199
sense

408
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,839
because the call stranger cbe come out

409
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,839
in june 2020

410
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,240
and we also found out that even though

411
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,839
they are a little different

412
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,440
but there is always include

413
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,800
uh telnet ssh and up mp

414
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,000
in top 5 targets

415
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,199
service because we thought we believe

416
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,920
it's because they are very common use

417
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,519
service for the iot

418
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,440
device and we also

419
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,639
found out that most of the attackers are

420
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,519
from

421
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,839
china and u.s

422
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,360
which very makes sense

423
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,399
this chart is the attack trend

424
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,399
against home iot appliance the

425
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,800
attack number of security camera is the

426
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,559
top one we believe

427
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,199
the reason is that the screen camera the

428
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,599
security camera always opens some common

429
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,480
service

430
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,599
for example web and upnp

431
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,480
other appliances don't open load service

432
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,799
at all

433
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,240
so the attack number is much stronger

434
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,199
than security

435
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,240
camera the other reason is that some

436
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,839
appliances use our

437
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,120
their customized service the pro numbers

438
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,520
are different or others are some

439
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,679
something are different from the regular

440
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,400
d4

441
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,679
setting service so that makes

442
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,039
those attack number very low and

443
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,280
the most of the attack are just poor

444
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,480
skin

445
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,360
even not with any paper at all

446
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,480
let's go deep for attack against two

447
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,360
security camera the top two attack

448
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,400
source country are china and the usa

449
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,120
and almost all of the attack are against

450
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,760
to upnp and http

451
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,480
which the web interface we also

452
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,039
acknowledge that

453
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,120
for a upnp it's most of the

454
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,640
most of the attack for upnp are image

455
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,080
search message which is

456
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,200
the pole skin

457
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,120
could be a attack trying to find

458
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
available device

459
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,400
for ssd reflection attack

460
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,600
or launch ssd reflection tag which

461
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,440
related to we mentioned before in

462
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,480
june 2020 the code strangers

463
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,160
attack for upnp

464
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,640
as conclusions i mentioned before we

465
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,360
also use

466
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,080
our product as a physical honeypot like

467
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,880
we open

468
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,400
some zimbab service open sound upnp

469
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,480
service open some web service

470
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,679
which very commonly used in iot device

471
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,799
so as we open the same bus service we

472
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,600
did not

473
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,640
add any protection we don't have

474
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,000
any other authoritation for

475
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,880
the service so which means that everyone

476
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,760
can easily

477
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,440
access the shared folder as a result

478
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,679
as a reason we found out there are many

479
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,480
interesting simple industrial folders

480
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,880
the first one is we found they will have

481
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,480
some male values

482
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,840
some sample ability to attack the

483
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,600
service so there is a

484
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,640
samba cry attack payload

485
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,679
in the honeypot

486
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,880
the second one is we find out there are

487
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,679
some

488
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,720
temp uh port scan file

489
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,600
in the shared folder which means the

490
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,320
attacker

491
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,679
will trying to use a map as a postgame

492
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,720
attack

493
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,159
as a pole skin but it will put a

494
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,880
test file in the short folder in the

495
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,000
beginning

496
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,960
the last one is we found that there is a

497
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,679
there is a tag file which there is a

498
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,679
malware which not specific

499
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,240
for iot device it's for windows however

500
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,640
it's still used same bar exploring

501
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,919
to to to place it in the

502
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,120
show folder even though

503
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,799
which is i mentioned before they may

504
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,799
some are someone still

505
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,600
very questioned about how can we do with

506
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,799
those data

507
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,679
and how can we benefit or how can we

508
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,159
take some advantage for those data

509
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,600
how can we use those data to benefit our

510
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,320
develop

511
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,760
or benefit all the life cycle of

512
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,039
our product and is those data

513
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,480
actually used for and as we are not a

514
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,000
security company

515
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,840
is those data are qualified or useful

516
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,120
for our develop those questions i keep

517
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,159
coming out

518
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,679
and are trying to give some answer

519
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,679
in this session the first one is

520
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,960
how can we do for the develop that's a

521
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,720
very interesting question because

522
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,520
in the beginning without maybe we can

523
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,240
give them

524
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,080
some ioc like the ip the d1

525
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,280
or sound cve number they may be

526
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,440
thing that will be very important for

527
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,559
them but

528
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,760
in the end no no that's not

529
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,919
what they care they care about what's

530
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,280
the high-risk

531
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,799
service they care about how

532
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,080
the malware get into a device

533
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,039
but they don't care who is the attacker

534
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,000
before the

535
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,520
group and what kind of device being

536
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,640
affected by other what's the other

537
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,760
company

538
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,159
device thing of that that's not the

539
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,679
thing they care about

540
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,400
so it's quite different for us because

541
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,960
when i was in the security company

542
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,480
most of the most of the

543
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,000
account company they're trying to get

544
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,360
more c ioc or more cve

545
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,200
information but when you go

546
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,400
to talk to actually talk to develop

547
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,280
you will know what they care about is

548
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,480
they want to know

549
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,960
more about their product they want to

550
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,240
know how can they

551
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,400
actually use those information to import

552
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,200
their products security so that's very

553
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,760
important for land to know the things

554
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,360
which happen in their product so

555
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,559
we use uh their product

556
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,200
as a physical honey part to see what

557
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,840
kind of

558
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,280
attack actually happen in their product

559
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,960
and if that's a season art or

560
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,799
it will affect your service or not

561
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,919
and because those attack are from

562
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,960
wild so they will think that

563
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,000
if the products are actually released

564
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,760
it will happen the same situation in

565
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,520
this kind of environment

566
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,320
so that's very cool thing is that which

567
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,880
we thought the ioc is very important for

568
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,280
him

569
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,720
but no i think for right now we observed

570
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,440
that

571
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,919
uh what the most things they care about

572
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:40,480
is

573
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,480
how the malware get into the device

574
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,640
but we're still trying to find out a

575
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,279
best way for them to provide the most

576
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,480
useful information and this is also the

577
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,360
question we

578
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,640
still trying to do our best because

579
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,919
uh we still have a lot of negotiation or

580
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,760
discussion list that developed

581
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,440
and trying to find and provide the best

582
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,720
rapport or voice information for them

583
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,880
to improve our product security

584
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,720
for management we are really lucky in

585
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,200
penance only because our manager

586
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,600
is very supportive kind of security

587
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,320
project

588
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,679
they give us a lot of space in trying to

589
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,320
see what kind of things we can do right

590
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,120
now we do have regular meeting with the

591
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,960
manager and high level to provide

592
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,240
some interesting funding from our system

593
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,440
and our product

594
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,480
and our project and we will provide them

595
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,159
some attack trend

596
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,600
to see what's happening for iot security

597
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,240
right now and we're trying to do more

598
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,360
than that

599
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,640
so we we can help them to understand the

600
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,360
risk

601
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,000
and also the reason behind the attack

602
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,080
for them to do a better understanding

603
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,559
about

604
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,000
attack and also try to help them go down

605
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,320
the

606
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,880
risk to improve our product security

607
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,200
and we also provide some security

608
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,080
training

609
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,640
for the manager for then have more

610
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,400
understand about what kind of things

611
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,360
they can do and to do those decision

612
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,840
is that anything will affect the

613
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,120
security

614
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,400
and how can they raise down the risk

615
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,400
and those things are we trying to

616
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,520
do for for the manager

617
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,720
and based on our straight playful we

618
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,200
also

619
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,320
provide some regular we try

620
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,039
we also want to provide some regular

621
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,400
report for them

622
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,600
and also for each unique we will we want

623
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:45,919
to

624
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,960
have more specific uh

625
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,000
report and more detail

626
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,559
so the things are we trying to do and

627
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,000
continue to discussion

628
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,520
with the manager and also have more

629
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,120
uh negotiate or more discussion with the

630
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,080
uni right now and we believe those are

631
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,559
very important for the manager and also

632
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,799
very important for our product security

633
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,360
for the community contribute is the goal

634
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,320
we always trying to do and trying to

635
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,440
reach and we found out that over

636
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,200
30 percent of the malware in our data

637
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,159
are not being uploaded to various total

638
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,039
so

639
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,520
there is an idea that we thought that

640
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,640
may be useful

641
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,000
for our company too or other community

642
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,640
too

643
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,279
so right now we do have some discussion

644
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:39,679
with

645
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,279
uh some company to correct we exchange

646
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,360
those uh ioc data or those

647
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,919
intelligent and even though

648
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,520
there is already a lot of data or

649
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,360
a lot of iot honeypot but

650
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,640
for our perspective that

651
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,760
is more focused on manufacturing so our

652
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,799
information and

653
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,080
our data are

654
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,240
more useful to focus on the

655
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,360
manufacturing

656
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,360
they they may be a little different

657
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,360
within the security company

658
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,480
that's with one of the good things for

659
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,200
us

660
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,840
and we're trying to use those

661
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,559
information

662
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,480
to improve our product security and we

663
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,960
also want those information can

664
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,600
help the community and also help your

665
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,720
company

666
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,399
so we are welcome to have more

667
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:47,120
uh opportunity to collab with you guys

668
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,320
so what's our next step

669
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
right now we're trying to climb more

670
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,440
data from a

671
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,760
physical honeypot because right now

672
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,720
we're trying to

673
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,559
build more physical honey part for

674
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,679
to have more data and more focus on

675
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,720
our product and to see what's happening

676
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,840
in those attack and is that success or

677
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,559
not

678
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,600
and it will actually happen uh

679
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,039
to affect our product or not and

680
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,240
after those data be collect

681
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,120
we're trying to do more analyze right

682
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,960
now maybe we can just

683
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,640
give them some regular information

684
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,000
but we're trying to do more about

685
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,960
uh more for them like we're trying to

686
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,840
making those

687
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,200
attack to our product

688
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,840
in development with the standard

689
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,799
