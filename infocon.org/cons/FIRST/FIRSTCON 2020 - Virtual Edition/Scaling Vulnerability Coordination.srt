thanks so much thank you for staying

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,879
so hello everybody this is mitsuko inui

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,399
and i will be moderating this session

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,600
today

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,079
today you are attending the session

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:46,719
scaling

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,760
vulnerability coordination um just one

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,680
item before we get started

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,360
so we ask that you submit your questions

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,320
for q a through the q a section in the

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,039
zoom

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,079
screen you have the questions will be

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,559
queued in the order they are received

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,200
and with that let's go ahead and get

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,280
started so i will start by introducing

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,720
your speaker today

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,320
for this uh session so francis perron

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,840
is at google in incident response

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,840
he is actually from canada but is

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,680
currently now in switzerland

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,200
he has joined google 2017 and started

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,360
out in site-related engineering

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,560
site reliability engineering and has

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,000
since moved on through several different

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,840
roles including responding to

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,759
availability incidents

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,840
across the google production environment

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,960
and to

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
full-time digital forensics and instant

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,000
response role

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,399
uh with which is where he has been since

48
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,079
2017.

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,079
so with that i think i will turn the

50
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,799
tables over to you francis take it away

51
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,479
thank you hi everybody um

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,119
so thank you for joining me and uh yeah

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:57,920
let's see

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,079
let's see how this virtual conferencing

55
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,360
uh pans out

56
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,040
so it's gonna be my first preference

57
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,240
first presentation entirely online so

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,199
let's see how we fare um so today i

59
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,840
wanted to

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,280
present a case study essentially uh

61
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,840
the approach that google took to try and

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,560
scale

63
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,840
uh the classic pcert structure

64
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,599
so this is

65
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,760
again a case study because um this is

66
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,040
going to be we're going to

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,920
look at the proposal that we made and

68
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,599
how it worked out because

69
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,400
earlier in 2020 this is when we started

70
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,800
implementing and looking into this

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,400
so before getting started um a little

72
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
a little um a little bit about

73
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,760
nomenclature here

74
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,280
so the word pcert so product security um

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,959
the way that i'm gonna be referring and

76
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,879
using it and the material that i have is

77
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,519
really

78
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,360
around these vulnerabilities that are

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,680
kind of time sensitive very complicated

80
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,640
very complex

81
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,280
cross product cross pas inside inside

82
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,000
companies

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,560
the impact is spread and there's also a

84
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,239
need for coordinated vulnerability

85
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:06,959
disclosure

86
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,400
so uh the single product impact

87
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,640
vulnerabilities are not really in scope

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,599
for

89
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,840
this case study as well as what we

90
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,040
worked on

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,879
this is already being dealt with for us

92
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,800
internally with we have a fairly large

93
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,040
security team at this point which

94
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,560
satisfied pretty much all of these

95
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,959
little like one product vulnerability

96
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,280
issues when there's a new cvs

97
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,879
like coming out in the public and so on

98
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,319
we have automation that takes care of

99
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,920
that in general but

100
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,319
the bigger problem arises when we have

101
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,280
coordination

102
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,120
needs across either internally or

103
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,000
external aspects of it

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,360
and that coordination actually so

105
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,799
one thing that we have internally at

106
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,599
google is uh this protocol that we've

107
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,280
it's not invented at all it's just that

108
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,319
we've we've reused something called ics

109
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,480
and we've adapted it to our needs

110
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,360
internally

111
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,959
and we call it incident management at

112
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,720
google now this has been discussed and

113
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,439
presented in

114
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,319
other material namely we have a book by

115
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,480
the sre organization that goes into very

116
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:06,799
much

117
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,439
a lot of details and i won't i just want

118
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,120
to brush up on it because it's important

119
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,680
for the proposal

120
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,798
so the core and this structure this

121
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,000
response protocol

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,120
allows us to actually use uh

123
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,160
the scaling methods that we have here

124
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,960
one thing so this the protocol itself

125
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,400
has at the core

126
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,280
the incident coordinator so incidents

127
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,880
and vulnerabilities are very similar to

128
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,919
one another

129
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,560
and we'll get to that but for instance

130
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,280
this

131
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,800
this protocol is shared across

132
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,560
engineering so

133
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,960
the incident coordinator is a role that

134
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,280
basically takes care of the incident

135
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,960
they are responsible to make sure that

136
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,880
the incident is going smoothly

137
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,800
we have enough people we don't have too

138
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,080
many people

139
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,240
and it's also the role of the decision

140
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,800
maker during the incident typically

141
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,120
especially for availability issues you

142
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,160
get time pressure

143
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,240
around decision making the internet

144
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,720
coordinator takes that role

145
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,160
now under that role under that person

146
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,880
we typically have sub-roles or leads as

147
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,000
we refer to them

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,360
and the ol the ops lead so

149
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,440
operations lead tends to be the person

150
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,840
who fixes the issue or is responsible to

151
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,120
do so

152
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,680
and that means that they have to and

153
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,600
they're responsible to build a team

154
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,759
that will fix the issue you see the

155
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,120
little periodic

156
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,360
symbol on top of it here this reference

157
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,280
is uh this is just to illustrate the

158
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,560
fact that you can have multiple

159
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,600
operations lead

160
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,400
in a bigger incident for example if you

161
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,479
need to split the incident and sub

162
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,360
aspects or subtactical responses this is

163
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,840
where this would be multiplied

164
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
another lead role that is fairly

165
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,880
critical to most incidents

166
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,039
is communications so a communications

167
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,960
lead would be responsible for

168
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,560
communications inside and outside of

169
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,720
incidents sometimes split

170
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,160
as well for press or internal comms

171
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,759
and so on and a little

172
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,160
little star here because this structure

173
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
is very simple and very lightweight

174
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,560
we tend to like it allows for scaling up

175
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,360
and down

176
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,880
in the number of leads as well as the

177
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,400
size of the response

178
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,759
if for example an incident requires

179
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,800
a legal person to give advice well then

180
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,280
we would elect a legal lead

181
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,800
so that's what i mean here by like

182
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,400
depending on the incident

183
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,600
you will scale this up as needed this is

184
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,120
for incident

185
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,199
but turns out vulnerability management

186
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,680
is very close to this um

187
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,840
you know it's a very simple very well

188
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,919
it's a big difference but

189
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,720
as far as coordinating it's pretty much

190
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,360
the same

191
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,759
so what we are doing is that we're

192
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,759
reusing entirely the whole protocol

193
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,520
we're just calling it vulnerability

194
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,800
coordinator instead of incident

195
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,240
coordinator

196
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,000
to make everyone happier about it and

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,880
at the level of the operations lead for

198
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
vulnerabilities this tends to be

199
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,520
per product because you need a certain

200
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,000
level of expertise and knowledge that

201
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,400
one person does not typically have or

202
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
can gather for like android and chrome

203
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,199
for example

204
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,840
those are two different beasts and when

205
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,800
an incident or

206
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,720
when a vulnerability touches on both or

207
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
impacts both we would have

208
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
of like an obsolete for chrome and then

209
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,639
upside for android

210
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,000
but the rest of the structure is

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,160
actually the same and

212
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,280
that's kind of the beauty of it because

213
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,240
the whole of the engineering corpus is

214
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,880
trained

215
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,199
in that protocol meaning that when we

216
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,639
have an incident

217
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,080
that impacts them and you know

218
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,000
an incident commander or coordinator

219
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,240
reaches out they know the protocol

220
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,120
they know what to expect and banking on

221
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,879
this

222
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,720
we can actually start scaling things and

223
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,680
by scaling here i mean that how do we

224
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,400
with a small group of people

225
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,360
respond to pretty much all vulnerability

226
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,000
like

227
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,240
all coordinated vulnerabilities as we

228
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,199
see them fly by

229
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,560
now according to the like not official

230
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,000
but the definitions that we see

231
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,319
in the wild namely one of them is

232
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,520
promoted by

233
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,879
the p cert the sir piecert sig at first

234
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,319
there was a document about it a couple

235
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,199
of years ago it basically discusses

236
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,120
centralized versus distributed and

237
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,039
includes an in between called hybrid

238
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,639
p cert uh structures the hybrid is kind

239
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,399
of like in between but the two extremes

240
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,159
are centralized versus distributed in

241
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,679
that case

242
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,799
now for a centralized p

243
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,120
cert this is actually nuts so we looked

244
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,479
into it and

245
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,480
for us at google it does not make much

246
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,880
sense uh the problem that we have is

247
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
that we have too many products and

248
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,839
you know we're not unique i mean a lot

249
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:52,560
of companies

250
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,839
share that problem and it's it becomes

251
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,519
very hard to have a central team that

252
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,040
basically has all of the expert

253
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,240
knowledge

254
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,120
to do security fixes security rollouts

255
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,760
uh

256
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,000
and implement these policies and so on

257
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,880
to so many other pas and products

258
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,480
so looking at this from like

259
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
as an implementation problem uh this

260
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,600
isn't something we

261
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,720
we can look into now on the other end of

262
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,440
the spectrum

263
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,720
the distributed model what we have here

264
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,880
is that we have a smaller team

265
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,760
that is part that is the pcert core team

266
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,320
and

267
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,720
next to that we basically interact and

268
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,839
leverage experts

269
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,959
across the various products now this is

270
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,080
actually getting interesting

271
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,839
but it means that we need security

272
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,839
experts or security savvy folks in most

273
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,720
of these products and pas

274
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,760
that kind of happens at google for us so

275
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,200
we're actually in a good place to look

276
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,000
into this

277
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,080
and the small core team is actually

278
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
really exciting as well because we can

279
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,480
get started we can pilot ideas much

280
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,399
faster and if we need to hire

281
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,959
a full team of staff expert security

282
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,040
engineers for example

283
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,160
so banking on that again

284
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,720
we picked the distributed approach and

285
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,640
kind of pushed it even further a little

286
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,600
bit

287
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,600
and this is where our implementation

288
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,480
comes in so me bert vert

289
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,680
is our proposal and solution so earlier

290
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,040
in 2020

291
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,279
we designed and started implementing

292
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,240
this

293
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,440
so the rotation itself is a so this is a

294
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,600
vulnerability incident response team now

295
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,320
the name is of kind of a mouthful and

296
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,160
you know we put vulnerability and

297
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,800
incident response team in one word

298
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,120
internal nomenclature rules and so on

299
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,240
essentially

300
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,839
it's a rotation that is staffed by

301
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,560
volunteers

302
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,480
and here these volunteers actually come

303
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,600
from everywhere and

304
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,680
volunteering for us internally at google

305
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,640
means

306
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,920
using this 20 project that we get

307
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,640
so as part of our contract we're

308
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,079
basically allowed to use 20

309
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,680
of our time to do personal projects

310
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,600
personal growth projects

311
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,839
uh that could also include working in

312
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,000
other teams just to help out to discover

313
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,880
things

314
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,160
so using that we're actually

315
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,920
using people's 20 projects to contribute

316
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,680
to an incident response team that

317
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,040
focuses on vulnerabilities

318
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,279
with that it allows us to also have a

319
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,800
very small core team

320
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,240
that is associated with the rotation and

321
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,480
this is again using the distributed

322
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,440
model approach

323
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,399
this we've kind of limited this to just

324
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,279
a little

325
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,120
minimum requirement set essentially

326
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,279
cross site cross time zone

327
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,320
and cross teams just to allow

328
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,560
the core team folks to go on vacation to

329
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,920
take time off to be sick

330
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,560
as simple as that sounds and it's even

331
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,839
more relevant nowadays i find

332
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,560
so we have a small team core team of

333
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,240
experts that have been doing

334
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,639
vulnerability coordination for a while

335
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,279
and are able to actually help and mentor

336
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,800
and assist

337
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,480
and a rotation and a couple of

338
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,959
volunteers so

339
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,480
what does it mean to volunteer and why

340
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,079
would people actually volunteer for this

341
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,079
so we found out that

342
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,399
we did a couple of recruitment campaigns

343
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,160
through email internally

344
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,800
and daniel i'm going to get to your

345
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,519
question in a second

346
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,360
and what we found is that the aspect

347
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,279
of career growth was really interesting

348
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,600
for folks because it's a very different

349
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,399
problem set

350
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,399
to most products most software

351
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,160
development problems that they have to

352
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,360
deal with

353
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,200
and at the same time security is

354
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
actually really interesting nowadays

355
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,360
so we see it more and more in the news

356
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,519
and folks actually

357
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,000
there is kind of an uptick in that trend

358
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,639
and

359
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,880
we're using this as well turns out folks

360
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,000
love it

361
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,079
and at the same time the third bullet

362
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,320
point here is really because

363
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,680
since we're dealing with volunteers

364
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,880
uh it's it's kind of hard to guarantee

365
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,480
that they will be around it's

366
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,160
essentially it's not part of their core

367
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,519
job

368
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,920
so the way we work with this is that we

369
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,720
get

370
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
kind of commitments not written down

371
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,160
contracts per se but

372
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,760
really a year-long commitment that you

373
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,680
will be a part of this rotation

374
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,440
and you're expected to give this many

375
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,200
hours and we get agreement

376
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,800
uh through the management chain of that

377
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,120
person as well which helps solidify

378
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,839
all of that and so far we've had really

379
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:26,880
good success here

380
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,519
now daniel's question was how do these

381
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,360
volunteers get trained in the area they

382
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,959
wish to support

383
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,120
i'll get to that in the last section of

384
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,560
the caveats

385
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,279
but essentially training we don't have

386
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,000
specialties

387
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,680
and that means that vulnerabilities are

388
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,079
the products impacted is agnostic to the

389
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,519
situation because of the

390
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,880
protocol that we use the incident

391
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,639
management protocol

392
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,079
it doesn't matter what incident or

393
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,639
vulnerability is being taken care of

394
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,240
and that's that's actually the beauty of

395
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,079
it

396
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,920
so does it work um

397
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,160
i think it does and well many of us

398
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,600
actually do agree here

399
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,279
and it's quite good because we've had uh

400
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,600
we've had so we started the program in

401
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,839
early 2020 recruitment started in

402
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,440
february just about

403
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,320
and we started training folks to like

404
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,519
coordination how to deal with

405
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,440
vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities in

406
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,240
general

407
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,519
what security topics uh mean and

408
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,839
what is it to have an embargo and how to

409
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,760
respect it and so on

410
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,839
so we've built training and we've kind

411
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,760
of gotten that down in the first

412
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,079
quarter and a half of the year i'd say

413
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,839
and at that point in the second quarter

414
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,720
just about

415
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,760
june or just about june

416
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,399
we started looping in rotators and

417
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,120
volunteers

418
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,880
into coordination of these

419
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,399
vulnerabilities

420
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,959
and one of them that actually was a nice

421
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,800
success story is

422
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,079
just about in july there was a

423
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,639
disclosure and this vulnerability called

424
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,279
boot hole

425
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,079
which i don't know if folks remember but

426
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,440
quickly it was uh

427
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,120
there was a problem with secure boot and

428
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,639
grub and the way

429
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,560
that shims could be exploited to

430
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,320
you know work on the white list and get

431
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,279
more binaries trusted which was an issue

432
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,519
so it turns out corporate environments

433
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,680
across various industries were impacted

434
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
hours was as well a little bit

435
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,519
so we needed to coordinate across

436
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,800
acquisitions

437
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,160
across corporate and some products who

438
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,279
may be impacted

439
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,639
for example like our google cloud stuff

440
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,320
do we need to loop in coordination as

441
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,680
well in there

442
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,959
so this vulnerability came in through an

443
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,079
usual pipeline and we decided okay let's

444
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,000
do a coordinated response internally at

445
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,399
least

446
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,120
this what ended up happening is a

447
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,199
classic so we ramped up a response with

448
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,000
a vulnerability

449
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,480
coordinator at the top and then an

450
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,320
operations lead who was basically our

451
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,000
technical person

452
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,920
working to help us make good judgment

453
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,639
call we also had someone taking care of

454
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,720
scoping and managing the impact on the

455
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,399
mergers and acquisitions

456
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,320
we also had someone who was basically

457
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,839
owning the communications

458
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,839
uh preparing the price statements and

459
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,920
all that just reactively and so

460
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,320
and we also had operations lead assigned

461
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,920
to each of the products impacted we knew

462
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,560
about

463
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,320
and externally to that there was also

464
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,000
external communication and sorry

465
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
coordination

466
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,759
so for example working with the

467
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,519
researchers and stuff like that the

468
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,240
classic

469
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,279
cvd issue and aspects

470
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,519
and when we started this response we

471
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,040
looped in two volunteers

472
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,120
from virt right off the bat who would

473
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,279
sit next to the coordinator

474
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,959
and they would basically get as much

475
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,360
context as we as possible

476
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
invited to every sync meetings and

477
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,800
decision making and shared with

478
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,399
documents and all that

479
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,720
and basically at the end of every

480
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
meeting that we had

481
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,959
i was a coordinator for that one and i

482
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,079
would just sit down

483
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,480
five minutes past the meeting and just

484
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,199
okay like

485
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,360
let's debrief a little bit do you have

486
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,319
any questions

487
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,760
and let's address those comments and

488
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,679
what went on and so on just

489
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,520
a quick five minute recap at the end of

490
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,959
every meeting turned out to be really

491
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,119
impactful here

492
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,359
towards the end well towards the end as

493
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,839
in close to the disclosure in july

494
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,160
i needed to sadly go on vacation in a

495
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,039
very uh

496
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,480
you know bad timing i guess you want to

497
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,039
call it but this was also a really good

498
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,880
opportunity for us and

499
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,200
what we did is we asked the volunteers

500
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,320
to take over

501
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,919
because they were trained we trusted

502
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,520
they would make a good judgment

503
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,280
and they did so we basically inserted

504
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,480
two volunteers

505
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,160
straight up took over the coordination

506
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
role and another volunteer

507
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
who was also shadowing during the whole

508
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,799
time took over communications leads

509
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,799
and that worked out real well and then

510
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,240
we kept someone senior

511
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,919
on the cvd aspects of it essentially

512
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,600
to maintain the relationship with the

513
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,919
researchers we did not actually do a

514
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,280
change at that level

515
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,039
but that was also a minimal amount of

516
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,480
communication that needed to happen

517
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,160
any further so for us this was a success

518
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,280
story and

519
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,200
it gave us hope that we would actually

520
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,120
be able to make something out of this

521
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,400
um since then so that was july now this

522
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,960
is a few months later

523
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,440
we've had other instances of these uh

524
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,520
like very similar scenarios uh

525
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,039
sadly a lot of these disclosures are not

526
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,559
possible for me to discuss here but and

527
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,200
but there's still like there's most of

528
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,919
our rotation

529
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,640
has been doing these shadow experiences

530
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,679
at this point

531
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,679
to the point where right now we have

532
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,520
ongoing vulnerabilities

533
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,480
that from time zero have gotten the

534
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,880
rotators to basically coordinate

535
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,120
and this is actually a very positive

536
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,760
outcome for us

537
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,240
now

538
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,480
of course since this is a young program

539
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,640
we're kind of still in the early stages

540
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,760
of it

541
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,400
from a program management perspective so

542
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,600
we're still developing

543
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,240
the whole structure of it and that means

544
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,200
how do we

545
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,039
streamline the training how do we

546
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,679
improve on it and we're doing that right

547
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,280
now we're kind of like working with the

548
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,919
rotation

549
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,080
people to just say like what worked and

550
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,760
what didn't how to how do we

551
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,559
together build a better program here how

552
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,840
do we ensure mentoring

553
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,559
is consistent and high quality and

554
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,480
involves and interests people

555
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,679
working on these two aspects

556
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,919
simultaneously and

557
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,240
um i'm going to get to that question a

558
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,120
second

559
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,360
and maturing this further so basically

560
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,559
what we mean here is

561
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,400
how do we make this self-sustained

562
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,000
sustained of sorts

563
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,320
as in what happens with the recruits

564
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,760
from last year

565
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,799
do we ask them to give their spot to

566
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,120
somebody else or do we take these folks

567
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,679
and make them you know train them into

568
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,760
even more senior contributors

569
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,320
which would actually help out in the

570
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,520
longer term but we

571
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,600
we're working on these on these ideas

572
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,360
and we're going to be exploring this in

573
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,559
the early 2021

574
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,840
uh stage there's a

575
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,679
do these rotators also coordinate with

576
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,600
external teams in case of cross-company

577
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,120
coordination

578
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,159
in some cases yes we've had we've had

579
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,280
successes

580
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,760
where basically when we engage with the

581
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,640
external

582
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,360
companies or researchers we basically go

583
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,640
in pairs

584
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,080
and the main coordinator always stays

585
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,720
basically on the line or as a backup and

586
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,640
drives the communication at first but

587
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,760
always loops in

588
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,720
the rotator who then starts taking more

589
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,039
and more space into that

590
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,960
so yeah we do have rotators basically

591
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,200
managing external or

592
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,159
inter-company coordination in some cases

593
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,720
now there's the other aspect of it which

594
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,600
is um

595
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,840
how do we deal with very urgent

596
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,120
vulnerabilities and

597
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,400
that's actually a legit question

598
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,480
given this is a rotation of volunteers

599
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,000
we don't really

600
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,559
we can't expect folks to do 24 7

601
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,640
contributions to a response

602
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,080
uh google tends to have 24 7

603
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,039
like just we call it follow the sun

604
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,360
response or coverage in general

605
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,880
so if we have an issue oh

606
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,039
if we have an issue and it requires

607
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,200
hourly updates and so on we call these p

608
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,559
zeros so right now the program's not

609
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:26,960
able

610
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,559
and staffed to handle that kind of

611
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,799
pressure or demand so we are still

612
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,240
working with our incident management

613
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,000
team who has been historically dealing

614
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,440
with these things

615
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,679
so we're working with them still the

616
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,000
goal here is really so that the program

617
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,480
gets more mature develops itself into

618
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,320
something more structured and we can

619
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,679
remove some of these

620
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,640
p0 vulnerabilities from the incidents

621
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,400
the incident management team

622
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,880
but that's not going to happen right now

623
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,400
we're looking at how we can design this

624
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,520
and work with this in the future

625
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,320
that's actually all the material i had i

626
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,360
wanted to

627
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,440
thank you all to attend like for

628
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,360
attending this

629
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,799
little note here there's some

630
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,400
information like some contact

631
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,600
information for me so if you have

632
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,000
questions

633
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,480
that you prefer to send over emails or

634
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,840
discuss privately

635
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,520
just feel free to reach out by email i

636
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,120
do have a twitter account but

637
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,039
don't expect me to be too much on this

638
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,440
um i it's created

639
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,960
it works uh the last point here is that

640
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,520
we are planning to actually try and

641
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,000
write up

642
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,320
and publish a white paper on this as

643
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,080
well so hopefully we'll be able to

644
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,679
actually go into further details about

645
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,799
this and

646
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,080
uh we will also have like

647
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,320
more experience and works uh more

648
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,080
history so that we can actually expand

649
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,679
on some of these things that worked and

650
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,360
didn't so hopefully pandemic willing

651
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,840
as written here so that's all i had um

652
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
thank you very much and i'm happy to

653
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,039
answer questions

654
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,400
from here on francis so

655
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,960
uh you addressed both questions i think

656
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,919
that are in

657
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,159
the um uh q and a um

658
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,480
what i was wondering so if somebody

659
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,000
listening wanted to become

660
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,280
involved um and get the

661
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,880
um training and join

662
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,159
uh do they just contact you or is there

663
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,600
something they go through oh you mean

664
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,039
get access to the actual training

665
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,320
material we did yes

666
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,200
at the moment it's very internal because

667
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,720
we do discuss

668
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,159
of vulnerabilities that we've had to

669
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,679
deal with and what kind of impact and

670
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,840
response we've made for them

671
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,240
so this the material as as is is

672
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,960
definitely not

673
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,600
publishable externally but if you're

674
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
curious i'm happy to

675
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,799
basically go over the steps like this is

676
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,760
pretty generic in the sense of cbd

677
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,279
training

678
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,960
so yeah if you've had to deal with

679
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,480
coordination with cross company stuff

680
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,159
or if you haven't actually there's some

681
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,279
good resources already on the pcert sig

682
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,400
at first yeah okay

683
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,799
thank you so another question has popped

684
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,039
up so do you plan to publish security

685
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,200
advisories in machine possible format

686
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,840
like ca

687
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
csaf

688
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,600
so that's kind of a i think that's out

689
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,799
of topic a little bit

690
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,159
uh i do not know what the plans are

691
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,440
for that like as far as we're concerned

692
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,080
like

693
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,279
these this team or this program

694
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,799
really focuses on coordination of

695
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,480
vulnerability disclosures

696
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,640
uh and also like the internal responses

697
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,600
we may need and

698
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,279
stuff like that it doesn't really scope

699
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,960
out the security advisory aspects

700
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,520
of impacted products and how we

701
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,799
communicate because

702
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,600
the like our the google cloud products

703
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,640
actually

704
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,320
communicate outside through security

705
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,159
advisories so sometimes these actually

706
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,679
make it out

707
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,600
i think those actually follow a very

708
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,039
handwritten format

709
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,799
at the moment if you're asking for like

710
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,559
something that has enough structure to

711
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,240
be processed uh

712
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,679
cves and cpes are pretty much

713
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,360
what i can think of at the moment that

714
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,960
we have like that is very public

715
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,279
chrome also has advisories project zero

716
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,000
also but those

717
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,240
those tend to be manually generated

718
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,120
thomas i'm sorry

719
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,400
i hope that answers a little bit of your

720
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,720
question

721
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,279
thank you so if there aren't

722
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,200
any more questions at the moment if you

723
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,440
had anything else that you wanted to say

724
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,760
but

725
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,200
actually cut out of your presentation

726
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,440
because of time restrictions i think

727
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,039
um you have a couple of moves to go

728
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,799
through that or we can

729
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,000
maybe end early oh one more question

730
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,880
what have you learned so far what have

731
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,320
we learned so far is that um

732
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,840
this idea of using volunteers to

733
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,320
handle like critical vulnerabilities was

734
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,400
scaring a lot of people especially

735
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,760
like senior managers and uh so we went

736
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,080
about it very cautiously

737
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,679
at the end of the day though like six

738
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,520
months in we were

739
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
showing really positive results which

740
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,039
even surprised us

741
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,240
so i think what we learned is that it's

742
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,200
surprisingly

743
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,240
feasible to actually train folks in a

744
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,080
very generic

745
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,360
like coordination aspect of things

746
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,840
uh like we're we're really happy with

747
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,039
the results that we've had

748
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,880
and we really want to see how far we can

749
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,320
push this even further

750
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,919
and that's why we're actually having

751
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,679
folks lead full

752
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,919
vulnerability responses up to uh

753
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:36,960
recently

754
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,080
and again super positive i couldn't have

755
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,240
some better results like inside a year

756
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,919
so yeah so that's excellent thanks for

757
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,279
asking lisa

758
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,799
okay so there's actually one more

759
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,840
question so

760
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,679
um uh i joined late and may have missed

761
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,400
it but

762
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,760
what teams are you inviting to

763
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
participate as volunteers how do you

764
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,080
know they can do the work

765
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,000
it's a good question so when we first

766
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
did the first recruitment

767
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,120
of emails essentially i targeted very

768
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,320
generic

769
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,678
roles essentially

770
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,919
the for the first wave we looked at

771
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,679
candidates who were

772
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,480
in engineering and in roles of either

773
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,159
program management technical program

774
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,919
management like all of these together

775
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,480
as well as engineering like software

776
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,360
engineering

777
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,679
site reliability engineering we also

778
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,679
have

779
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,279
folks that are a bit more junior on the

780
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,360
tech ladders and we've actually included

781
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,200
some of those folks as well just to

782
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,960
see and we have a lot of variety at this

783
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,399
point we don't actually have

784
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,760
anybody from security on that rotation

785
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,320
so that has also been like something

786
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,919
folks weren't sure about but

787
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,919
turns out if you have passionate people

788
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,159
it actually works well

789
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,440
yes um actually another question

790
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
so i have read that you published the

791
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,520
bleeding tooth vulnerability i was just

792
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,399
wondering

793
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,600
why it is not in nvidia yet it's only in

794
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,080
reserve

795
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,640
status is that usual when you publish

796
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,120
such critical vulnerabilities

797
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,520
so this question sadly shouldn't be

798
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,240
addressed to me

799
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,799
so intel agreed and owns the cve

800
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,600
publications for these we

801
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,520
i can ping them and see if they're ready

802
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,360
to issue but generally speaking i think

803
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,240
that they have

804
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,720
a regular cadence of issuing so it might

805
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,600
be in the next

806
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,159
revision or the next push that they have

807
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,440
i'm sorry i don't have a good

808
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,559
answer for you on that one okay with

809
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,679
that i think

810
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,200
we are pretty much just at um our time

811
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,840
so

812
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,919
thank you francis and thank you for all

813
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,039
the lively questions

814
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,039
um lots of comments saying that this is

815
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,440
a very good idea interesting

816
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,559
um initiative for google to do and

817
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,520
i find many people are very interested

818
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,960
in what google is doing

819
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,679
so thank you again francis for this very

820
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,039
interesting wonderful presentation and

821
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:57,600
thank you

822
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,360
for the audience for participating in

823
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,640
this session today

824
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,360
um so the next session will begin in

825
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,720
