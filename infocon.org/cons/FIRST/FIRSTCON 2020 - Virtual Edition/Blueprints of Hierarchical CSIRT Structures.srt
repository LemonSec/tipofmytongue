1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,199
hello everyone uh

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,480
i'm here to talk on topic of first

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,200
conference

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,599
on blueprints of hierarchical c-set

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,880
structures

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,880
c-series standing for computer security

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,880
instant response team

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,920
my name is willis benetes i'm working

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,400
daily for energy cyber security from

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,480
lithuania north europe

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,400
part of european union and you can find

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,640
me on linkedin in case

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,679
five on discussion would evolve

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,720
as you're going to see from a

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,359
presentation

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,399
so about myself

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,440
my areas of expert expertise is

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,680
working with seasides and soft

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,680
establishment or modernization so there

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,200
are some revisions over

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,160
countries where i actively been involved

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,039
in

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,280
invest success or it's still ongoing

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,800
projects currently

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,640
kenya barbados and some other countries

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,000
which are not listed here

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,840
and in that work with my colleagues with

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,720
our team we use different methods as

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,240
well we look not only about

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,600
technical engineering of

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,080
team you know what skills you have to

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,600
have how you automate it

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,159
what mandate you run but as well in the

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,840
dominance framework we need to look at

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,799
uh

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,840
how countries uh organize their season

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,200
and in order to better our

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,280
particular team for that reason

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,640
what we have noticed over several years

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
and we start looking into it it's

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,720
regarding the challenge of cesar

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
national ecosystems so if we

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,960
agree that we are around 200

44
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,920
space for 200 national seasides because

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,680
that's approximately the number of the

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
countries existing in the world and

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,399
there's no sea sets

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,200
on the moon on the mars so we would

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,759
expect

50
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,799
around such number finally to reach

51
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,240
of the national seasons and then

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,520
i was thinking where to place a

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,000
threshold but probably if the country

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
reaches more than 2 million population

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,560
then there appears that one single sea

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,160
cert is not sufficient in the country

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,959
similar like

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,720
single hospital probably is not

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,239
sufficient for the country

60
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,920
for health problems and then we

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,319
start to look at uh what we as sectoral

62
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,520
seasons may be

63
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,200
maybe they are collective sea sets a

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,640
very interesting story

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,400
if we look at the netherlands for

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,319
example where

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,239
to my understanding municipalities

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,360
joined together which

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,760
are not very strong or resourceful

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,040
organizations and

71
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,440
when we said okay collective it's not a

72
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,800
negative word what comes from my

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,560
background the soviet union

74
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,000
country for 50 years but rather

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,160
it's about joining our forces in order

76
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,920
to achieve a joint

77
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,280
objective as well naturally

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,040
more mature organizations or those who

79
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,560
want to organize themselves

80
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,319
more properly they start to establish

81
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,080
individual seasides

82
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,800
inside internal css or calling them

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,360
socks or calling them in another way

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,480
or as well in

85
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,879
such economies it's natural that mssp

86
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,879
managed to future service providers

87
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,640
as t-sets or cyber socks or socks

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,239
statup and provide monitoring

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,599
instant response services as a service

90
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,840
model and we hear more and more about

91
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,200
mssp's currently

92
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,280
depending on the country in uk it's more

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,720
developed probably in switzerland

94
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,000
let's develop such ecosystem

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,239
but we have these names and

96
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,760
the question are they all independent

97
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,680
or should they have responsibilities to

98
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,280
each other and if they are

99
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,640
responsibilities what kind of

100
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,000
responsibilities

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,200
so of course if you think about internal

102
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,480
seaside or mssp and when thinking about

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,200
national set so probably there's no

104
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,280
responsibilities from uh

105
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,640
internal season to national site

106
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,319
uh and maybe national site is

107
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,918
mandated to do something to to help

108
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,759
local internal seaside but maybe not so

109
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,880
but as soon as national legislation

110
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,759
starts to be

111
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,639
implemented in the country then which

112
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,639
starts to talk about sectorial sets and

113
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,240
their responsibilities national

114
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,800
certainty responsibilities or maybe

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,160
joining an overlapping maybe

116
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,040
academically set becomes national site

117
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,759
or moved in some place and with

118
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,759
discussions on overlaps and the power

119
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,600
play starts to

120
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,639
uh raise the question so

121
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,600
personally i felt such questions raised

122
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,840
in bigger countries than 2 million

123
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,240
especially their painful i believe in

124
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,360
the countries of

125
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,400
1 billion size or 200 million size or

126
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,840
100 million size

127
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,840
organizations or countries such as

128
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,479
could be south africa where governance

129
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,360
frameworks are

130
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,240
quite developed india

131
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,840
and when i was approached with such

132
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,560
question from india please advise

133
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,400
what would be the relationship between

134
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,240
sectoral versus national versus

135
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,199
individual

136
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,639
it's tricky what you advise to country

137
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,520
1.3

138
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,600
billion citizens

139
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,199
and then whales i would say nigeria

140
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,880
probably similar questions egypt's

141
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,960
similar questions

142
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,520
another place even in my country which

143
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,560
we are three million

144
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,280
people the financial sector said

145
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,000
questions

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,639
you know what is the role of sectoral

147
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,520
side

148
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,280
would be what is not covered by a

149
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,360
national site or individual

150
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,000
teams in the financial sector when we

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,639
are becoming more and more fintech uh

152
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,479
hub for as we provide very easy

153
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,160
license compared to other european

154
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,639
countries for electronic money

155
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,840
transactions and operations

156
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,880
so by looking at that this topic and

157
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,080
then validating and

158
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,199
some of these discussions that i

159
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,120
mentioned happened in the gfc global

160
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,360
forum for cyber security expertise

161
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,800
one year ago then i initiated such

162
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,840
thinking process and discussing so maybe

163
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,880
if we draw some inter-relationship maps

164
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,520
it would be

165
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,240
beneficial for all of us because then

166
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,280
it's not clear

167
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,440
what roles can play or there's no tools

168
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,880
how to justify where

169
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,440
what should sit in a particular country

170
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,080
then

171
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,190
it sometimes slows down

172
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,520
[Music]

173
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,680
the establishment of seasons because

174
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,730
maybe somebody

175
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,919
[Music]

176
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,199
misunderstands where the borders

177
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,599
sit and then start to suppress small

178
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,599
organizations or

179
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,800
or under another questions so this gfc

180
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,199
work was not progressing uh too much i

181
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,319
was expecting them

182
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,880
to present this topic uh in live in

183
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,319
canada and as well

184
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,479
having uh physical discussions with

185
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,000
seaside people

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,039
or other nations people in the same

187
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,880
topic on the gfce group

188
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,199
b talk it didn't happen so

189
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,120
uh we are where we are i believe the

190
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,639
topic is relevant and it's going to be

191
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,599
relevant for

192
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,440
many countries in the future so having

193
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,880
at least something like this

194
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,199
and then initiating further discussion

195
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,400
would be

196
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,520
relevant so

197
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,120
as i mentioned the objective is to

198
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,720
assist the inspire seasons in the

199
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,479
countries to find effective ways

200
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,039
of partnering and developing cooperative

201
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,120
mandates of seasons in the country

202
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,960
saying you know this is my place this is

203
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,199
your place let's work jointly

204
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,199
and understand why something finishes

205
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,240
here

206
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,520
um in government organizations it's uh

207
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,080
at least here in the territories were

208
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,360
way what mostly

209
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,759
government agency usually says what we

210
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,280
do but we do not

211
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,319
tell what we don't do so sometimes you

212
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,840
need to read in between their lines for

213
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,280
example

214
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,240
do they work cover over residence of the

215
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,120
country

216
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,080
you know can some would if old lady

217
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,960
would call

218
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
the national site or sectorial said

219
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,039
would be answer and how we justify

220
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,599
whom we are covering whom we don't cover

221
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,879
and how to ensure if

222
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,720
every organization in the country are

223
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,479
covered by national set

224
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,280
and national organization like bank is

225
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,200
covered by sectorial set

226
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,279
so whom an organization should call

227
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,440
any of those options because the under

228
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,958
the same realm

229
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,919
um or this particular sequence or

230
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,120
particular interactions

231
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,959
so there should be naturally there

232
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,560
should be some internal

233
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,680
national agreements with the

234
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,760
organization how they hand over how they

235
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,640
share

236
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,680
what who picks up the first call how

237
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,600
how they partner in the incidents

238
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,240
so the objective is to provide some

239
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,440
pictures

240
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,800
and create some knowledge

241
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,920
of known unexpected scenarios for either

242
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,600
two-level national organization or

243
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,920
three-level national sector organization

244
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,360
interactions so first of all

245
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,480
uh probably it's important to to focus

246
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,200
on

247
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,279
mandate of future organization as a

248
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,399
seaside so

249
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,600
there we talk about authority

250
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,920
which is handed to that organization so

251
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,120
this particular set is a provided

252
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,959
authority

253
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,440
to supervise incident resolution

254
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,320
coordination

255
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,519
or et cetera et cetera so what we can do

256
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,360
can we block something can we

257
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,399
introduce police policing functions or

258
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,120
coalition

259
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,480
policing actions on particular incidents

260
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,160
or on stations along

261
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,680
they always come responsibility so

262
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,140
if you have power we have to as well

263
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,480
[Music]

264
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,959
be responsible for how we use the power

265
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:09,920
as well

266
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,320
where they apply their power because

267
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,800
often that power is given only to them

268
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,000
so if we do not use that power where

269
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,519
they should

270
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,240
or possibility for example the national

271
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,200
set uh

272
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,600
receives some data from uh team

273
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,640
kimbrough or

274
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,519
shadow server and they're the only ones

275
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,880
who can get that data

276
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,800
and so if you don't take that data and

277
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,880
we don't share to the relevant

278
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,720
stakeholders for better good for fixing

279
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,880
the toxicity digital toxicity of the

280
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,760
country's

281
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,240
additional pollution that's lost

282
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,440
opportunity

283
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,279
and if that's their responsibility and

284
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,959
if you take that as a responsibility

285
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,399
because it's declared and

286
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,040
clean the sector on the nation or for

287
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,640
the individual set

288
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,720
then it's good to measure than the

289
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,880
because that responsibility of authority

290
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
is usually expressed as well or

291
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,920
clarified with objectives and tasks

292
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,360
so in european union countries and this

293
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,240
directive

294
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,079
mentions what kind of sectoral status

295
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,600
has to be established and as well

296
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,880
mentioned there has to be

297
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,920
objectives and tasks and placed for them

298
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,000
as well

299
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,920
so let's imagine that when we build

300
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,839
something like light the house

301
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,800
we expect that it would fulfill the

302
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,440
function and responsibility to to

303
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,560
producing the light beams and in stormy

304
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,680
weathers

305
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,120
uh for the boats with lost radio signals

306
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,320
we still can guide way to go and how to

307
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,320
move according to agreed procedures

308
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,760
uh how we look at the world

309
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,880
uh of seasons and socks for here

310
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
for us they are synonymous because we

311
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,639
implement the same

312
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,600
season services model we know that they

313
00:11:59,600 --> 00:11:59,920
are

314
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,600
technical teams on implementing

315
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,519
the mandate which comes probably from

316
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,000
policy makers or board of directors and

317
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,440
organization

318
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,839
which is given to chief security officer

319
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,839
or information security officer maybe a

320
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:14,800
cio

321
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
saying please take care of cyber

322
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,040
security or information security

323
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,839
and then we need a team which serves

324
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,160
constituency

325
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,519
uh we've been serious detection

326
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,200
coordination resolution information

327
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,800
sharing etc in order to

328
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,320
protect digital assets and then working

329
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,079
uh the and here instantly there's a link

330
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,880
to the right to responsible coordination

331
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,320
response coordination

332
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,000
for coordinating of uh incidents with

333
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,040
national side or seaside

334
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,680
uh where it's a question is it mandated

335
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,240
or not

336
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,399
do i obliged to do that or not and then

337
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,120
of course each of such organization um

338
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,880
establishes own partnerships

339
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,880
of understanding with law enforcement

340
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
agencies intelligence agencies private

341
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,120
uh

342
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,519
mrsp's or private organizations research

343
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,639
organizations

344
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,720
and as well for them in the work they

345
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,360
need the international recognition

346
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,480
and as we see in in the corner first

347
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,000
map which shows that intensity

348
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,800
of such teams we see that in some

349
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,480
territories we are more of them

350
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,200
established and recognized being the

351
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,880
members of first

352
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,680
and of course in some other places maybe

353
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,760
there is a blank there's nothing but

354
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,440
maybe there are such teams just not

355
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,120
members of the first year but still i

356
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,240
believe such

357
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,519
such map is a good indicator

358
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,639
of the intensity

359
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,000
so when we look at them graphically what

360
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,839
can be brought in to the picture so

361
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,760
we talk about national certain we call

362
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,279
it cesar selection

363
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,320
we talk about system as a sectoral set

364
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,240
for example for finance for energy for

365
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,519
research for

366
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,279
other areas chemicals research

367
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,040
this is one that may be military or

368
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,480
defense

369
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,120
and then in finance sector we think

370
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,079
about

371
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,959
organizational seaside in financial

372
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:15,519
probably

373
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,000
banks individually have their own system

374
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,760
energy maybe there's a

375
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,440
organization c certainly or maybe it's

376
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,040
just a security team in a particular

377
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,560
organization

378
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,839
as well as we have uh um

379
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,720
other teams in java sector here in the

380
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,360
drawing

381
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,680
they look very hierarchical so it seems

382
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,959
that we have some

383
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,320
uh defined obligation of course

384
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,360
if uh gdpr and

385
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,839
national service future law mandates

386
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,360
every organization especially the

387
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,519
secretarial organizations financial

388
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,199
organizations

389
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,480
or because they're critical in

390
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,240
organization critical information

391
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,079
infrastructure they're obliged to report

392
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,079
incidents a particular

393
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,399
process particular sequence and with

394
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,760
these obligations uh

395
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,320
it is established who does who needs to

396
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,360
do what

397
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,279
and um and the challenge then becomes if

398
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,160
it's three layers

399
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,040
so then organization receives incident

400
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,320
or

401
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,160
handles incident whom we have to report

402
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,399
to sectoral to national to both

403
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,839
and if the sectorial should sectoral

404
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,560
instantly

405
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,440
notify national or why that should be

406
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
the case

407
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,160
so the mandate who is responsible for

408
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,120
whom my

409
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,160
the same picture can be shown in another

410
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,639
way which allows

411
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,600
instead of authority to present more of

412
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,320
a responsibility

413
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,800
shows this picture so the national

414
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,000
season

415
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,560
as i mentioned it covers residents

416
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,639
sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't

417
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,959
even in scandinavia and rich countries

418
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,079
it might be that residents are outside

419
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,000
the the mandate of the national

420
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,560
threat being that tomorrow understanding

421
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,880
in finland denmark even netherlands

422
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,040
they are outside uh it doesn't mean that

423
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,440
uh national season will not help but at

424
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,160
least the

425
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,079
resources they are true to themselves

426
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,920
that they don't have sufficient uh

427
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,279
resources to

428
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,000
cover or the needs of the people on the

429
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,800
other hand

430
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,199
the national system of israel promotes

431
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,240
for quite some time award for two years

432
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,320
but everybody can call them

433
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,399
in and they'll be supporting any

434
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,160
business any

435
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,560
any people needs in cyber security any

436
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,440
challenges

437
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,480
and then we have again this ecosystem

438
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,360
that's saying that

439
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,880
if he is a bank so it feels uh

440
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,279
on the sectorial uh first first

441
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,680
so again this is how fast uh how we

442
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,560
because we represent energy set as well

443
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,759
um

444
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,759
how we look at the world uh

445
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,359
and the numbers right now is 540

446
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,119
teams in first and everywhere where is

447
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,880
at least one team probably we have these

448
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,799
discussions so what tribe is typical

449
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,199
interactions or expectations

450
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,240
so for what we

451
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
know at first as well developed updated

452
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,359
there and updated the version until 2.1

453
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,000
i believe a cset

454
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,760
model as this one

455
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,600
and there are typical services what

456
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,360
seaside or sock is providing but

457
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,799
expectation matrix um what is important

458
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,840
probably

459
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,360
uh this is this blueprint i would say

460
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,880
um so before jumping into the text i

461
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,000
would like to

462
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,240
for you to look in the picture on the

463
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,200
side

464
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,919
two beers what are they doing are they

465
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:52,480
kissing

466
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,039
are they fighting you know it's gonna be

467
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:55,679
both

468
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,799
so it's good if we would think and

469
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,000
declare the expectation

470
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,960
what goes through the head is it uh you

471
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,440
know what

472
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,600
what i want from another person do i

473
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,039
want to dominate it

474
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,640
and what is my expectation from another

475
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,360
party so here in the schema i have

476
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,520
presented

477
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,360
what is expectation from cset an

478
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,120
organization what they want to do

479
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
themselves most probably and then what

480
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,720
we expect from other parts between

481
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,360
seaside national sectoria

482
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,280
and here when i was thinking should i

483
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,360
separate seaside national on sector and

484
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,160
separate

485
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,400
but probably the expectations are quite

486
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,919
similar it's just not

487
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,120
need to report up uh up in

488
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,640
hierarchy anymore so national seasides

489
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,520
we expect uh managing cooperation

490
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,320
reporting handling services framework

491
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,720
uh maybe securing security monitoring

492
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,080
with all sectors

493
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,000
and then the expectation from another

494
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,760
side from the threats

495
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,160
in organizations reporting level of

496
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,480
incident statistics resolving incidents

497
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,039
so i believe such schema can be taken as

498
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:01,679
initial

499
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,640
discussion in each of the country and

500
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,559
seeing does it apply

501
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,480
you know instead of wasting one hour

502
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,000
trying to to to build this

503
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,360
take this as uh example and

504
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
even if uh you want to validate the

505
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,640
mandates or if there is

506
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,400
some services law updates are being

507
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,240
discussed and discussed

508
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
then this one can be filled in as a

509
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,679
table

510
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,080
otherwise it's to sum up it's um

511
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,000
then we think about this national level

512
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,480
sectoral level organization level

513
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,080
basically it's uh the same question

514
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,559
in between all levels should there be

515
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,120
any mandatory tasks

516
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,600
and why in between

517
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,000
these teams from organization up to

518
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,280
sectorial from central

519
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,200
up to national underwater from national

520
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,039
of dissectorial to organization or

521
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,039
directly to organization

522
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,080
and by trying to work it out

523
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,280
i believe there's a good way to reach

524
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,200
proper setup proper collaboration

525
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,600
proper partnership agreements inside the

526
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,240
country

527
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,280
and moving and growing that trust

528
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,039
in ecosystem and building the ecosystem

529
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,039
so um here i would like to

530
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,240
finish that my this my

531
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,200
work is still in progress uh the reason

532
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,200
being that i wanted to move it in live

533
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,159
discussions

534
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,240
on different events which didn't happen

535
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,600
unfortunately

536
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,600
however i really expect that for those

537
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,919
who are listening and who feel that that

538
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,919
something was relevant to you

539
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,559
maybe we can reach out to each other

540
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,799
remotely via linkedin or the email and

541
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,679
then have a

542
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,600
you know zoom call or teams call and

543
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
then discuss

544
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,720
what other pictures we can draw and

545
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,000
bring out to community

546
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,919
in order to reduce the amount of

547
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,880
fights power fights and showing that

548
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,159
there's plenty of mandate and it's

549
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,760
possible to agree and maybe

550
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,440
as the tools to for agreement

551
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,799

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,720
