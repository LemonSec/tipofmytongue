appreciations to the first team for

40
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,000
making this work uh despite all odds so

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,200
i really appreciate being able to do

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,080
this virtually

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,759
um hope to see you all next year though

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,479
for sure uh so as sean mentioned

45
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,000
we're gonna be talking about personas

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,680
and how it relates to peacert and if you

47
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,200
don't know what personas are yet

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,040
you're in the right right talk for sure

49
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,479
and uh i'll definitely

50
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,400
shine a light on what that is and how we

51
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,159
use them in my uh my previous role

52
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,560
running a piecer

53
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,320
so uh contextually and this will make

54
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,920
more sense beyond the uh

55
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,200
kind of the obvious um so currently i'm

56
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,640
uh information security architect at

57
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,159
cisco i'm also a phd

58
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,240
student at dakota state university in

59
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,759
cyber security and i've had all these

60
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,119
other roles in my career so

61
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,880
previously in a lot of what this this

62
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,479
talk is predicated on

63
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,399
is running product security response and

64
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,479
appsec over at duo security which is

65
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,119
a part of cisco but i've also done

66
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,318
managed service providing

67
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,400
a provider consulting security research

68
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,239
unix admin stuff

69
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,280
so in each of those roles the needs of

70
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
my kind of professional career the needs

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,239
of my teams are very different right and

72
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,080
when we think about how we interact with

73
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,440
people just kind of

74
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,319
generally we really should contextualize

75
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,920
what their needs are what their wants

76
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,720
are

77
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,080
what their problems are and how we can

78
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,560
maybe lessen those problems

79
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
and so in this kind of framing if we

80
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,720
look at the idea of personas

81
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,480
and you'll hear this as personas or user

82
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,920
personas uh

83
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,000
very often regarding you know product

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,400
research design research kind of uh

85
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,959
fields uh and this this idea which i

86
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,720
won't read the whole blurb for you but

87
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,200
basically the idea of there are there

88
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
are facets of

89
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,840
uh kind of this broader archetype view

90
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,800
of people

91
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,360
that we can create this human

92
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,480
representation

93
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,959
of part of our audience and we'll talk

94
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,480
about a lot of those different

95
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,480
what those parts might be coming up um

96
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,920
but basically trying to boil

97
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,440
this very broad ocean where you don't

98
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,120
want to over generalize people you don't

99
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,599
want to

100
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,840
you know treat them stereotypically but

101
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,360
at the same time if you're trying to

102
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,760
address major audiences you can't cherry

103
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
pick one by one every time

104
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,599
so contextually for what i just

105
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,040
introduced

106
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,560
mark the college student as you might

107
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,720
imagine is not

108
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,480
really the same person practically when

109
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,760
we're talking about

110
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,120
interaction or needs or wants or desires

111
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,920
as mark the security researcher so as a

112
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,400
human

113
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,239
i've done both of those and many more

114
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,599
things but

115
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,879
if i were to reach out to your

116
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,640
organization and talk you know talk to

117
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,840
your

118
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,040
as a security researcher and or i'm

119
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,640
reaching out as a college student who

120
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,360
maybe is an

121
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,840
end user of one of your products the

122
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,120
college end user

123
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,280
is a very different type of persona than

124
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
the security researcher reaching out and

125
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,720
certainly when i say security researcher

126
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,560
and pcert you know i i know

127
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,319
there's a lot of uh maybe maybe concerns

128
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,519
there but we're gonna talk about how

129
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,720
personas can help

130
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,920
uh in addressing these different

131
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,439
audiences and really making for better

132
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,000
outcomes

133
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,239
uh as kind of promised by the title of

134
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,159
the talk hopefully

135
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,840
so a few things to think about as it

136
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,680
relates to personas i called it out once

137
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,199
i'll call it out again because it's very

138
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,000
important

139
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,320
personas are not stereotypes we are not

140
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,160
taking these very ticky tacky

141
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,040
representations of demographics and and

142
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,720
you know very often hurtful things that

143
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,240
we generalize people into

144
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,280
groups what we do want to do however is

145
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,800
a really a research-based approach to

146
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,120
there's an audience type how do we

147
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,680
qualify that audience type with certain

148
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,440
edges and it's not perfect it's not

149
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,800
meant to be perfect

150
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
but there are many ways to do this and

151
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
if and if you're going to

152
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,199
attempt to build personas or work with a

153
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,639
team that's going to build personas with

154
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,759
you

155
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,919
on the on the left side here i highly

156
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:56,880
recommend many

157
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,479
of these sources and many of these

158
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,720
approaches are used in building that

159
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,800
representation of this archetype

160
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,600
of a really a persona a couple of the

161
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,280
easiest ones direct interviews

162
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,360
so design research teams that i've

163
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,720
worked with before

164
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,000
and if they want to talk to someone

165
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,080
who's an i.t admin or a security person

166
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,479
or

167
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,639
you know what have you they'll just grab

168
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,320
someone from part of the team they work

169
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,720
with

170
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,240
and start asking questions and they'll

171
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,639
have a very you know specific list but

172
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,440
they'll

173
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,280
just get your honest feedback and then

174
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,880
they'll try to take you know the edges

175
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,320
of that feedback and actually

176
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,520
come up with like what is the

177
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,440
representation that we can use here for

178
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,080
a persona certainly academic

179
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,360
publications or

180
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,520
uh broader surveys and questionnaires

181
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,560
you know as long as it's a

182
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,000
representative sample

183
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,199
and well done um watching people work as

184
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,880
creepy as that sounds certainly uh

185
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,639
versus the direct interviews perhaps

186
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,120
if you are trying to build personas of a

187
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,919
certain

188
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,199
uh form or or function really

189
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,680
if you just see how people interact in

190
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,240
their job

191
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,360
see the kinds of questions they're

192
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,960
asking see the kinds of concerns they

193
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,039
have to get their job done

194
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,759
these are the things where uh as kind of

195
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,800
the pull quote in here

196
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
calls out it really is about getting

197
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,360
away from you you know you have biases

198
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,080
you have preconceptions you have maybe

199
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,639
um

200
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,800
past history that's shaping or warping

201
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,880
your view on certain audiences

202
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,319
and this is how you bring kind of the

203
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,960
empirical as reasonable as possible

204
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,120
back into this persona creation process

205
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,319
so that's honest

206
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,160
representative and uh you know

207
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,479
thoughtful

208
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,160
so here's an example persona this comes

209
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,240
from a design blog that i found an

210
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,800
example of

211
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,960
we have some more to look at but just as

212
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,120
like one quick introduction right

213
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
amy doesn't exist this is not a real

214
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,240
person um

215
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,120
that photo is probably a stock photo her

216
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,880
being 16 years old from phoenix and

217
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,840
single

218
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,080
these are all things that were maybe

219
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,520
influenced by someone real

220
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,080
possibly but they should not be a

221
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,319
one-to-one mapping to a real person for

222
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,360
instance right

223
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,479
so this is more of a uh awareness for

224
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,080
this blog post

225
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,479
in and you can kind of see a little um

226
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,919
sample pair a couple paragraphs down

227
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:04,319
there

228
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,680
there's like actually a narrative about

229
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,240
this person like they don't exist but

230
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,160
you're treating them as if they do exist

231
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,080
and you're treating them that they exist

232
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,400
that way based on all that research

233
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
based on all the analysis you've done of

234
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,560
that audience type

235
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,759
and calling out you know goals and

236
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,599
motivations just being aware of who they

237
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:21,840
are

238
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,680
what they need what they want is a

239
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,120
really strong way to start working

240
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,759
towards

241
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,000
addressing your audience versus just

242
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,440
projecting against your audience

243
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,639
and if you're starting to think and

244
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,160
we'll certainly get a lot more into this

245
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,440
um you know

246
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,960
p sir well i don't i still understand

247
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
how this is related to a piece remark

248
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,240
uh so the great part is if you like i

249
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,000
consider that product security instant

250
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,280
response

251
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,000
is a customer service function which i

252
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,280
really deeply do

253
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,720
then you're on the right path already

254
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,000
right because if you're in customer

255
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,879
service

256
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,560
what you're really looking for is not

257
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,400
closing bugs as quick as possible and

258
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,000
patching things as quick as possible

259
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,759
because those are very transactional

260
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,440
things what you're really doing is

261
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,960
building relationships and when you

262
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,400
build relationships you focus on

263
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
customer experience

264
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,919
so when you reach out and communicate to

265
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,720
this persona type to an actual person on

266
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,120
the other side of an email let's say

267
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,720
you're tailoring that response for that

268
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,000
audience type you're thinking about

269
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,840
their needs and wants and concerns and

270
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,720
fears

271
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,240
and you're trying to come up with the

272
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,800
most approachable way to handle that

273
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,639
engagement and create a dialogue

274
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,160
that builds that relationship based on

275
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,639
customer experience focus

276
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,360
we also as i can say personally myself

277
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,479
and i'm sure other people that have ran

278
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,039
a piece

279
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,399
or even a c cert before you don't want

280
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,240
conflict whenever possible because

281
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,000
people shut down they stop responding

282
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,320
they stop engaging they stop helping

283
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,959
and often when that happens it's really

284
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,399
kind of just an accident

285
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,839
it's not something that someone's trying

286
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,080
to do it's not

287
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,320
trying to drive them away it's these

288
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,440
accidental things that we're not

289
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,360
thinking about personas for instance

290
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,399
as how we're engaging focusing on what

291
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,600
they need and what they want

292
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,320
which helps the former uh and then the

293
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,640
other

294
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,160
part of this is it's for your team as

295
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,440
well and this is something i did with my

296
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
team and to help them

297
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,480
the people on the front line they've got

298
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,680
all the pressure they've got all the

299
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,120
stress they've got all the frustration

300
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,519
whether

301
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,880
good experience bad experience with a

302
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,560
certain reporter

303
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,000
these are things that we have to be

304
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
really considerate of to help prevent

305
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,040
our people to burn

306
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,920
from burning out and if we help them

307
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,320
from

308
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,000
uh if we want to help them prevent

309
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,480
burning out giving them the tools

310
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,399
like personas to use will actually

311
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,600
smooth their

312
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,160
smooth conversations hopefully avoid

313
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,600
those missteps and actually create

314
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,399
better outcomes

315
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,240
and it really is not that complex to

316
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
start and this is kind of the seating of

317
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,480
the data that we'll walk into a bit more

318
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,800
but you have in my case i've broken

319
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,560
these up two ways non-customer types and

320
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,600
customer types

321
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,680
so your bounty hunters your security

322
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,880
researchers

323
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,120
they could be customers but often not

324
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,399
often they aren't they're just

325
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,440
you know people looking for

326
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,360
vulnerabilities doing security research

327
00:09:59,360 --> 00:09:59,920
uh for

328
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,800
for fun or for for work or otherwise and

329
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,320
they have a bunch of customer types

330
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,000
so that could be the engineer who's

331
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,839
going to decide if your product's secure

332
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:08,880
enough to deploy

333
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,519
it could be your end user types or an it

334
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,920
admit that has to actually deploy it

335
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,279
that could be a cso i mean really

336
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,959
there's no limit to which ones you want

337
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,640
to create personas from

338
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,120
it just should be kind of an important

339
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,000
group or

340
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,600
audience to your business or your

341
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,279
business type

342
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,120
on the right side we see kind of just

343
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,360
the same words from the left with a name

344
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,640
added to the right and you're like wow

345
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,240
that's not it's not very exciting mark

346
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,880
like why

347
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,440
is that how you create a persona um but

348
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,040
this is an example where

349
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,519
if you look at actually the the right

350
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,160
side

351
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,560
um lee the end user andy the end user

352
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,920
gary the it admin

353
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,440
those are actually real personas that

354
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,120
duo security had created with the design

355
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,240
research team

356
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,320
now the ones above and below uh that you

357
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,240
don't uh that i didn't mention those are

358
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
ones i just kind of created offhand

359
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,360
and the one we're really going to talk

360
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,640
about today because we only have 30

361
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,360
minutes and

362
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,720
i want to make some question time

363
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,480
available uh is going to be bin the

364
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,760
bounty hunter so we're going to talk

365
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,600
about bin and how i created a persona

366
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,000
for this bounty hunter

367
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,079
um and so just one more thing to look at

368
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,760
real quick these are just again

369
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,320
these are real uh personas that were

370
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,399
created by duo of fake people

371
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,720
um so leave the end user and max the

372
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,160
vendor manager there's a bunch of them

373
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,880
at duo

374
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,240
but i just want to show you another exam

375
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,880
set of examples of uh kind of concerns

376
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
and pay points subjectives

377
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,640
uh the characteristics of these people

378
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,000
their backgrounds

379
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,680
and also kind of these quotes as if

380
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,440
there's real people speaking

381
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,360
again you're really trying to normalize

382
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,880
this in the culture of the business and

383
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,079
the organization

384
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,440
and i can attest to directly um when duo

385
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,240
uses these

386
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,079
the entire company uses them the

387
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,160
security team the design research team

388
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,240
the product team the sales team

389
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,200
every single person at duo uses personas

390
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,839
and

391
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,200
when everyone does it it works out

392
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,120
really well so this may be one of those

393
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,200
things that as you're looking to

394
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,279
bring on personas perhaps you can go

395
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,560
talk if you have you know

396
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,639
obviously proxy if you have a product

397
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,480
your team perhaps have a product

398
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,200
so if you have a product uh go talk to

399
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,000
your design team

400
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,920
go talk to your user experience team

401
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,000
your customer experience team

402
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
they might already be using personas and

403
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,519
perhaps you can just piggyback on that

404
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,240
effort

405
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,320
expand the use case and really drive

406
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,839
that further within the organization

407
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,519
when we're thinking about how to build

408
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,600
in one of the things i just brought up

409
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,680
was hey data data first right

410
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,760
well if you need to have data mark where

411
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
do you get data from

412
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,680
so here's a great example and this is

413
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,040
from uh hacker one

414
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,720
the the kind of bug bounding company

415
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,240
they have an annual report

416
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,680
and there's gonna be many pieces from

417
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
this uh which i'll call out but

418
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,760
here's one really interesting example

419
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
talking about when you have security

420
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,440
researchers

421
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,839
where where is the money coming from

422
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,040
where is it going

423
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,240
how much of their livelihood is

424
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,040
predicated on this and a couple quick

425
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,160
call outs number one 100 of income

426
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,760
comes from basically hacking security

427
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,040
research whatever you want to call it

428
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,519
but

429
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,680
bug value finding uh 22 of the entire

430
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,720
sample size audience 100 of their income

431
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,000
comes from this

432
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,279
so the next time you talk to a bug

433
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,800
bounty hunter and you're you know

434
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,240
thinking hey they just want

435
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,680
you know 50 bucks for this cross-site

436
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,839
scripting or 35 bucks for this c

437
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,720
surf um it could be because their entire

438
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,079
income is based on this

439
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,720
and so uh just again it's a it doesn't

440
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,639
change your maybe your response

441
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,160
but it might change the way you engage

442
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,680
them you might consider this as their

443
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,800
livelihood

444
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,160
instead of just like a fun thing to do

445
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,680
on the weekends and that's a very

446
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,480
important

447
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,360
kind of conceptual and empathetic shift

448
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,279
when you have an audience like that

449
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,800
and we can also see that a lot of money

450
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,399
starts in the united states

451
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,360
uh 30 million dollars of it but only six

452
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,399
million dollars comes

453
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,880
back to the united states which tells us

454
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,560
there's a wild disproportion

455
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,880
change between who funds bug bounty

456
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,800
programs and where bug binding programs

457
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,959
money goes so you also should be

458
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,880
cognizant that hey a lot of these

459
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,279
countries represented their cost of

460
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,079
living

461
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,920
might be dramatically lower than the

462
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,760
united states and there's and

463
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,600
my experience there's not really a cost

464
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,199
of living modifier

465
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,320
for bug boundaries so we'll talk about

466
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,199
this more for bin

467
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,959
but these are really important things to

468
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,720
be cognizant of and

469
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,800
you know one report a couple screenshots

470
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,079
and some of you on this call might be

471
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,120
going wow i just

472
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,480
you know i just thought it was hey i

473
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,920
want a free t-shirt hey i want fifty

474
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,720
dollars

475
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,639
um a lot of this might just come down to

476
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,320
like social economic status

477
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,720
and livelihoods it's a really basic

478
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,440
concept

479
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,040
that you find when you look for the data

480
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
defined

481
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,399
so here's ben and so ben um he's early

482
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,199
20s

483
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,000
living in china finishing up a computer

484
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,839
science degree not shocking for a bounty

485
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,279
hunter necessarily

486
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,279
has a part-time job as an infosec

487
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,480
analyst

488
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,920
nights and weekends is really the time

489
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,120
that he's spending mostly on bug

490
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,760
bounties

491
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,920
um and so in his case really motivation

492
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,000
wise extra income to travel

493
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,279
you know he's been in university he

494
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,560
wants to take some time off and enjoy

495
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,000
the world a little bit more post

496
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,440
pandemic clearly

497
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,920
uh building a reputation right a lot of

498
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,760
bug bounty hunters build reputations

499
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,959
with the bounties they find the

500
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,839
companies they find

501
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,320
issues with uh which is good for career

502
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,160
trajectory and resume building

503
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,360
and then also just impressing his

504
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,639
friends a lot of people in computer

505
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,839
science program

506
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,440
look at his skills are really impressed

507
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
they talk him up they introduce him to

508
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,680
people he builds his network

509
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,440
bin doesn't exist this photo is a stock

510
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,120
photo all these are from

511
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,839
all this information i made up but i

512
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,600
didn't totally make it up

513
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,440
um and so where did i get some of this

514
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,040
bounty hunter again the hacker one

515
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,360
report is just an invaluable source of

516
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,399
data

517
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,920
so we see that you know 41 of people

518
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,040
are have studied or are studying as an

519
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,440
under

520
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,600
undergraduate of this sample size that's

521
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,480
a very

522
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,079
pretty represented amount certainly the

523
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,079
largest percentage of the entire uh

524
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,440
group

525
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,639
um what describes you best and this 59

526
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,600
hack as uh hobby or my free time just

527
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,120
the same as ben bin does this on nights

528
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,440
and weekends when he has extra time

529
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,639
the age ranges we see that 42 is between

530
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,079
18 and 24.

531
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,800
again the largest percentage of bug

532
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,680
bounty hunters

533
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,720
are in this college age range

534
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,320
and then also keep in mind going back to

535
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,399
the socioeconomic part

536
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,079
in china a entry-level infosec analyst

537
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,000
full-time and remember ben's only a

538
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,120
part-time worker

539
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,720
earns about twenty thousand dollars in

540
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,240
china so probably about ten thousand

541
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,880
dollars

542
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,600
for bin but it's sixty thousand dollars

543
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,320
in the us

544
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,959
so that's a three x multiplier so if

545
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,320
you're thinking about a bug bounty

546
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,120
that's let's say

547
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,360
a ten thousand dollar bounty i mean

548
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,720
that's a that's a good value but they

549
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
certainly happen quite often now

550
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,040
that could be an entire part-time

551
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,240
infosec analyst salary in china

552
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,839
and again when you think of it that way

553
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,440
you're like wow that's i mean that's a

554
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,480
game changer and

555
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,279
in india um if you you have or you are

556
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,399
in india

557
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,720
you know proportionately i mean uh

558
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,000
twenty thousand

559
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,519
twelve thousand twenty thousand dollar

560
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,079
job in india for security engineering

561
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,320
you know uh kind of senior intro senior

562
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,079
pen tester depending

563
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,240
that could be a good job and in the us i

564
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,280
mean 120 000

565
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,799
would be very obvious you know for a lot

566
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,640
of people in a lot of markets

567
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,240
that's maybe five or six x so we really

568
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,079
have to be thoughtful to where people

569
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,640
are

570
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,240
what their lives look like education

571
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,839
income disparities uh cost of living

572
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,760
uh opportunity these are all really

573
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,520
important things and those are things i

574
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,720
thought of when i created bin

575
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,400
i want to really understand that persona

576
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,520
i'm not going to read through this eye

577
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,200
chart you'll have the slides after this

578
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,880
talk of course

579
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,360
but this is important context to do when

580
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,520
you're doing this process so

581
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,480
when the p cert engages our persona what

582
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,000
we what we want to start doing is

583
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,640
leveraging the persona and we do this by

584
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,000
saying things like

585
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,320
um how likely is it that this person

586
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,080
might speak at an industry event

587
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,679
because if we want to obviously be

588
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,000
represented well at defcon next year or

589
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,440
black hat next year

590
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,600
and this is a person or a persona type

591
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,320
that often speaks at those conferences

592
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,400
there might be a little bit of extra eye

593
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,160
dotting and t-crossing you want in your

594
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,679
communications back and forth

595
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,360
right the same thing for

596
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,520
media and press outlets again this isn't

597
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,200
about restricting a security researcher

598
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,520
as

599
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,720
a security researcher please don't

600
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,799
restrict us but um it's more about

601
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,840
remembering

602
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,080
different personas will have different

603
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,520
levels of

604
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,600
um potential impact on your business

605
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,880
revenue

606
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,280
they'll have more opportunity more

607
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,039
likelihood to post to blog posts and

608
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,760
twitter

609
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,320
and make maybe a bigger splash so again

610
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,600
it's not about

611
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,880
looking at these as negatives or

612
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,799
positives it's about likelihoods just

613
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,679
like you do a

614
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,360
threat matrix and it's an impact and a

615
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,520
likelihood we're kind of doing a threat

616
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,840
matrix relative to a persona type

617
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
and then we're contextualizing why it's

618
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,520
high why it's low

619
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,120
and this is the kind of sheet that

620
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,440
you can give your frontline people

621
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,720
so that they have a little bit more

622
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
understanding that you know yeah it's

623
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,280
not great if the bug bounty hunter um

624
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,880
you know it walks away and they're not

625
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,720
quite happy in the general sense as long

626
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,480
as you did a good job you treated them

627
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:06,880
well

628
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,960
you were thoughtful and and took them

629
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,000
seriously

630
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,360
they're probably not going to damage

631
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,960
your business revenue because the bounty

632
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,320
hunter wasn't happy with

633
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,799
not getting a bounty um but if you

634
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,000
treated them unfairly

635
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,559
if you uh ignored their their

636
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,000
vulnerability you didn't triage

637
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,280
appropriately

638
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,640
there's a high potential they're going

639
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,160
to go to twitter and tell the entire

640
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
information security community that

641
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,440
so you really have to trade these things

642
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,960
off and be aware of these at all times

643
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,400
like where are you investing

644
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,760
where are the potential downfalls

645
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,919
where's your return and if you

646
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,640
normalize this process with personas you

647
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,919
can create one of these

648
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,000
for every single persona and i'll kind

649
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,200
of show you a

650
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,960
quicker splash review of this in a

651
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,559
second

652
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,559
uh so in these in these kinds of

653
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,240
contexts with a bounty hunter like with

654
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,440
bin for instance

655
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,039
we just want to say hey you know read

656
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,960
our security response page

657
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,120
figure out if they do go on twitter or

658
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,799
do post on blogs

659
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,000
uh make sure that they know or don't or

660
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,840
make sure they know whether or not we

661
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,600
have a bounty program up front if they

662
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,960
are a bounty hunter

663
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,320
because we don't want any confusion we

664
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
don't want any miss you know again avoid

665
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,679
those missteps just make sure that

666
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,919
everyone's on the same page

667
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,679
um we can also see if they've submitted

668
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,200
a lot of things to us in the past

669
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,840
and are those things accurate are they

670
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,480
representative

671
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,720
but try not to with your piece or team

672
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,919
tell them that you're going to fix an

673
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:24,480
issue

674
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,919
if it's not going to get fixed because

675
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,280
they'll follow up and follow up and

676
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,240
follow up

677
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,440
and if you don't fix it and you never

678
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,120
intended to fix it that's a misstep that

679
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,640
you could have avoided

680
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,039
we should also not overstate the value

681
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,320
because remember a bounty hunter is

682
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,120
looking at things

683
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,919
in value lens generally and if you say

684
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,679
hey this is great bug like really really

685
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:42,480
important

686
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,760
but it's not and you're just trying to

687
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,120
be polite you're trying to just close

688
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,360
the loop and get done with conversation

689
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,559
you've done the opposite with your

690
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,880
persona for a bounty hunter ben wants

691
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,640
to hear that it's valuable and they want

692
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,039
to hear that it's important

693
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,200
you saying that to be polite is actually

694
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,120
creating a new problem for your pizza

695
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,400
not removing the problem

696
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,159
so one thing i always told my team is

697
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,840
frame this in consequences

698
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,799
so again just an overview what would

699
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:09,360
happen

700
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,720
like a worst case scenario what would

701
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,720
happen if bounty hunter founded a high

702
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,520
security

703
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,720
uh severity defect you've got to kind of

704
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,799
go through this process individually but

705
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,400
and you can read this slide later but

706
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,159
basically just saying we want to

707
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,440
represent our company well

708
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,360
we want our pcr to be representative of

709
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,799
the security program we run

710
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,559
we want people to trust our security

711
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,880
program and if you

712
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,960
ignore a bounty hunter and you're rude

713
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,280
to them and you ignore their bugs

714
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,880
that could turn around to hurt you in

715
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
the community of security professionals

716
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,720
and that could turn around and have

717
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,480
number a number of cisos that are

718
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,080
involved in the security community

719
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,520
look at your brand differently look at

720
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,200
your security program differently

721
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,559
so it's not always just hey it's a bug

722
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,400
bounty hunter they just want you know a

723
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,360
bounty

724
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,120
there are consequences and you really

725
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,400
need to be thoughtful about what those

726
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,320
might be

727
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,760
uh so just quickly comparing two

728
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,320
personas so ben on the left uh gary rit

729
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,000
i'm in the right

730
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,360
they're very different people they have

731
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,880
different lives different stories

732
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,840
different needs

733
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
um you know ben in this case wants a

734
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,600
little bit of extra money for travel and

735
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,200
he's in his college years

736
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,520
gary has kids and he's married in his

737
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,720
40s

738
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,640
he wants to keep his job that's gary's

739
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,559
motivation most days of the week

740
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,679
right and these are things that you know

741
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,679
being remembering that like gary's

742
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,440
accidentally finding security bugs

743
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,640
usually bin is looking for security bugs

744
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,919
gary can go like hey step one step two

745
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,000
bin can provide you maybe an exploit

746
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,520
right very different personas

747
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,280
different capabilities needs wants

748
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,760
desires and if gary's upset

749
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,280
you might not get that contract next

750
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,360
year if bin's upset

751
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,559
maybe a blog post gets written um

752
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,320
another eye chart again great thing to

753
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,080
look at after the presentation

754
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,280
um your company your your pcr may have a

755
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,000
different perspective

756
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,679
than this and certainly how you qualify

757
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,039
low medium high

758
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,039
but what i'd like to have you do if you

759
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,120
build personas build a chart like this

760
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,280
and then add context to it for your pcr

761
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,400
team so

762
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,840
when you're looking at what are the

763
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,159
risks if you don't treat lee well the

764
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,559
the corporate end user or the college

765
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,840
student or

766
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,440
these are all variable and a lot of this

767
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,360
is predicated on businesses i've worked

768
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,000
for so

769
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,520
take it you know take it your own way

770
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,600
for sure but build one of these and you

771
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,520
can start heat mapping out how personas

772
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,159
relate

773
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,919
to the risk that your business can avoid

774
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,559
if you avoid those missteps

775
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,159
um quick anecdote we're going to be

776
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,559
running into a q a here in just about a

777
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,000
minute or two

778
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,159
but calling out hey security engineer at

779
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,520
this company

780
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,840
that design uh that they saw they're not

781
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,039
happy with

782
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,640
pcert kind of gives them a generic

783
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,159
response

784
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,000
the issue reporter goes back to the

785
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,440
pcert and says hey

786
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,720
i'm going to publish these details in my

787
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,120
corporate blog it's a big blog people

788
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,640
are going to see it

789
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,159
and the solution this is a real life

790
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,000
anecdote that i worked my team through

791
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,760
we had to go and use a third party

792
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,039
friend of a friend

793
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,400
reset the whole conversation start over

794
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,679
um and as soon as we did all that

795
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,000
we they didn't publish a scathing blog

796
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,679
post about us which is great

797
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,360
we more importantly we found out what

798
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,799
they were actually trying to communicate

799
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,000
to us we were just on two different

800
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,919
wavelengths and just not talking

801
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,080
kind of the right framing they helped us

802
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,799
get a poc done of the actual code fix

803
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,640
i mean this is above and beyond what

804
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,799
most pseuds can deal with

805
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,720
and if we had used the personas and my

806
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,240
team had used personas which we didn't

807
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,279
have yet

808
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,640
they would have known hey high

809
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,559
engagement risk to the business

810
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,000
risk to um revenue risk to public blog

811
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,080
posts because they had a blog they had

812
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,400
you know twitter uh with a lot of

813
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,600
followers

814
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,200
these are things that the persona kind

815
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,720
of cheat sheets that i just showed you

816
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,840
that would have helped my team out

817
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,080
immensely and this is one of the stories

818
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,559
why i actually created the personas that

819
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,080
we we do had uh

820
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,320
they do have today at duke security um

821
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,120
it's not about

822
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,480
tricking anyone it's not about fooling

823
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,400
anyone it's about empathizing and be

824
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,720
being relatable hey sean

825
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,520
oh i can't hear you

826
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,080
there we go hey so uh we're getting down

827
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
to the last couple of minutes uh

828
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,760
we do have a question or two queued up

829
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,600
are you ready to answer a few questions

830
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,000
and

831
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,840
for anyone who's got a question please

832
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,919
be sure to add it to the q a box at the

833
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,360
bottom

834
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
yep uh uh give me one more minute i'll

835
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,799
wrap up these and we'll be on our way

836
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,480
um and so just when you look at those

837
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,400
areas like those dimensions of risk

838
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
in this case almost all of them were

839
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,559
true with this person and we completely

840
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,000
you know kevin mcallister did it was a

841
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,400
bad situation right um and so this is

842
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:34,799
another

843
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,240
kind of longer form slide i want you to

844
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,679
like read through top to bottom we're

845
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,200
not going to go over here

846
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,120
but really think about every reporter

847
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,880
that comes in the door to pcert

848
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,360
really do this kind of who up where when

849
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,400
really evaluate them

850
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,799
look them up and analyze the situation

851
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,840
build you know

852
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,520
map the persona that's relevant to that

853
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,400
person and this ties directly into your

854
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,840
piece of workflow if you use the iso

855
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,679
27000 workflow

856
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,200
um there's a lot of things that can

857
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,960
simplify those conversations when you

858
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,320
have a response page

859
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
when you have screw.txt when you have a

860
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
good front door when you have an sla

861
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:06,960
published

862
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,840
people know what to expect what not to

863
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,559
expect um

864
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,159
and thinking about assume positive

865
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,640
intent always always always assume

866
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,760
people are doing their best

867
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,279
are trying to treat you with respect and

868
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,039
you should reciprocate

869
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,799
don't be complacent no matter who you

870
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,240
think it is treat them

871
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,760
as if they're going to impact your

872
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,000
revenue as if they're going to hurt your

873
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,880
brand

874
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,799
um and manage implicit bias this goes

875
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,520
back to avoid stereotypes

876
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,080
build personas do data-driven analysis

877
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,600
for those

878
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,840
and lastly but not leastly at all

879
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,120
empathy 100

880
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,480
of everything that goes into customer

881
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,480
experience customer service

882
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,240
and just being a good human comes back

883
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,480
to empathy we build personas

884
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,520
to exercise empathy and if we do that

885
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,039
we're going to have a better time your

886
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,120
frontline people your business

887
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,880
uh and most importantly your reporters

888
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,559
that are reaching out to your piecer

889
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,120
so um that's it for me again i hope you

890
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,720
get a chance to look at the slides

891
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
a little bit more in depth and uh please

892
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,320
reach out and shaun yeah i'd love to

893
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,480
hear that question if i can go go ahead

894
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,120
absolutely so someone wrote in said my

895
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,159
responsibility

896
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,279
is one sub-device of a product which

897
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,600
consists of hundreds of devices

898
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,159
would your idea work out for such a

899
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,880
non-end user product too

900
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,559
so it sounds like maybe doing internal

901
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,880
yeah great great question so there's

902
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,480
really no um constraint to what a

903
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,159
persona can represent

904
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,200
so you can have an end user persona you

905
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,799
can also have as i kind of showed like

906
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,960
an internal i.t admin persona

907
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,360
you could have a help desk persona

908
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,159
really personas not are not limited by a

909
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,360
technical domain because design research

910
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,640
is everything from cars to security

911
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,200
gadgets

912
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,559
right design research

913
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,520
is is more of a domain and personas are

914
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,360
a facet of design research

915
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,679
so in my case i'm using it for pcert but

916
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,279
really it's a very open-ended

917
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,039
kind of vehicle that as long as you can

918
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,720
do your research on your audience

919
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,640
and create that persona there's really

920
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,240
no limit to what you can make a persona

921
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,120
for

922
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,720
that actually leads to our next question

923
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,279
from peter who said who within a piece

924
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,880
would actually do all this stuff whose

925
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,640
role would it be to map all the possible

926
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,760
personas and answer all the questions

927
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,679
um in in my case the person that runs

928
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,080
pcert i was i was the head of our piecer

929
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,840
uh for the company and i took it upon

930
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
myself because again i had my appsec

931
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,000
team which owned our pcert function

932
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,320
they were my front line um and so i

933
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,559
built the personas and all the kind of

934
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,840
eye charts and a lot of other things

935
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,360
that are internal of course that i can't

936
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,000
show

937
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,880
um that was that was 100 me because

938
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,880
again i want to reduce my team's burnout

939
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,840
i want to make sure we have good

940
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,080
interactions because who who gets the

941
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,679
escalation if it doesn't go well at the

942
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:48,399
front line

943
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,399
mark mark does right so everyone's

944
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,320
incentivized to have this go well and

945
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,840
for me it's just like a top-down

946
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,919
leadership thing but this could be a

947
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,559
really fun thing especially in a virtual

948
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,440
kind of pandemic world do this as a team

949
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:01,760
build

950
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,200
you know kind of team building exercise

951
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,120
have people break up in small groups

952
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,440
build a persona do the research together

953
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,880
present it to the team

954
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,240
and then aggregate them so you can

955
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,679
actually divide and conquer this quite

956
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:12,159
well

957
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,600
just kind of set the guard rails down so

958
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,720
everyone kind of comes back with a

959
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,120
consistent um persona type

960
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,720
and out of curiosity mark how long did

961
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,039
it take you to put this together

962
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,279
um so the larger cheat sheet i have so

963
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,960
kind of that uh the heat mapping and

964
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,000
some of the contextual

965
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,080
stuff for all those different roles uh

966
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,279
it was a couple days of work

967
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,440
and it really is less work than it seems

968
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,320
like because if you know your audience

969
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,679
if you've dealt with bounty hunters

970
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,039
you've dealt with it admins you've dealt

971
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,960
with security engineers and researchers

972
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,200
you're more playing back a lot of the

973
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,720
hey this went poorly

974
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,640
why why was that and then you go do an

975
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,159
interview of that kind of person and say

976
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:46,640
hey

977
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,159
when you reach out to a piecer what do

978
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,760
you expect from us right

979
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,600
so you kind of look at your historical

980
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,279
like where do things go wrong

981
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,480
because often that will teach you the

982
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,960
lessons you need to be learned but

983
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,120
you know that they're they went wrong

984
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,960
the question is why did they go wrong

985
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,559
and that's where your research comes in

986
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,480
that's where you reach out to people and

987
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,600
in my case i have a

988
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,520
you know big network of lots and lots of

989
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,200
different persona types researchers and

990
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,480
bounty hunters and

991
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
i.t admins and so i just asked my

992
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,399
community the hacker one report was

993
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,240
another great source again to really

994
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,600
contextualize

995
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
um that that specific part of the you

996
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,799
know the field

997
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,399
but it's uh you know it's a labor of

998
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,080
love for sure and uh

999
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,360
it's one of those things if you kind of

1000
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,919
just sit down create your personas first

1001
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,240
uh or define your persona types first

1002
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,600
and then say where could i get

1003
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,440
useful information about this type this

1004
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,200
type this type

1005
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,760
get your data sources look at the data

1006
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,640
and then aggregate

1007
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,159
so it's just kind of a workflow and if

1008
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,000
you do it once you can do it five more

1009
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,760
times just as easily
