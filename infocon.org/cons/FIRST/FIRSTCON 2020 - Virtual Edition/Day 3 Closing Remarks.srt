and um i'd like to welcome you to the

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,600
closing session of this first

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,960
annual conference 2020. by now we kind

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,400
of used to have a lot of

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,800
online meetings and conferences to me it

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,480
kind of feels we can do

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,920
724 conferences and talks however these

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,600
past three days for me

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,719
stand out as a virtual conference uh it

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,160
was really

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,160
amazing we had amazing talks we had

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,600
really good questions so we have

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,280
participation which is something that i

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,600
often miss in online events

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,280
and that made this whole thing a really

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,719
unique

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,800
experience like we're all engineers so

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,719
let's actually look at the numbers we

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,120
actually

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,039
are people that believe in the numbers

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,480
so we had more than

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,680
two and a half thousand registrations uh

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,680
500 actually came in the past

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,280
in the past three days and we had uh

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,640
over 800 unique visitors per day so that

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,040
made this actually one of the largest

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,640
uh conference ever running such an event

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,680
is much more than just

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,720
switching on on uh zoom so for for the

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,000
participants and for us

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,680
moderators it's just it's kind of like

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,360
you get a zoom link you click on it

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,840
and in you go it actually takes a lot

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,759
more there's the pc that had to

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,079
the program committee under lucy thanks

44
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,200
a lot lucy

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,000
had to revamp the entire program to

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,720
create

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,280
convert it from a in-person conference

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,920
to a virtual event that's no small feat

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,360
then the conference team that's tracy

50
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,399
charles grace and kristen really had

51
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,880
to work very very hard to actually make

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,600
all of these

53
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,079
these things work every speaker every

54
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,320
moderator had a unique special links you

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,840
have to juggle these links you have to

56
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,560
juggle them

57
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,560
while being in parallel sessions and

58
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,239
and they had to prepare all of this by

59
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,919
not really having a

60
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,239
whole lot of experience in running such

61
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,239
big virtual events so they were building

62
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,280
up their know-how

63
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,680
so quite amazing i'm really totally

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,640
amazed uh

65
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,959
how well that turned out so great thanks

66
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,200
to the pc to lucy and to tracy

67
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,920
and the respective teams but last but

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,720
not least

69
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,400
we also had the speakers that were kind

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,160
of confronted with hey

71
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,680
we actually changed the program

72
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,319
completely you have much less time

73
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,239
would you be happy to do this in front

74
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,000
of a uh

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,519
a camera rather than in person and

76
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,080
i don't think the content suffered so

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,840
this was really really great

78
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,040
so really a big round round of applause

79
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,480
for uh

80
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,959
for all the involved people um so i

81
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,000
think this is a

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,360
a great conference um but there's

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,040
there's one thing that really makes me

84
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,200
sad about not having an in-person

85
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,360
conference and that's that i can say

86
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,200
goodbye to derek schultz derek was

87
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,879

88
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,000
conference

89

90
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,080

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,680

97
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,720

104
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,959
a great event

105
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,200

107

last three days

112
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,840
and it was an interesting experience

113
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,480
after so many wonderful in-person events

114
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,519
we had

115
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,360
but we are planning for the orient for

116
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
the next one and the next one

117
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,959
will be hopefully in fukuoka in japan

118
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,840
and the dates are the 6th of june to the

119
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,519
11th of june

120
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,040
2021 and i think we all really want to

121
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,918
meet and we hope

122
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,040
we first want to really accomplish that

123
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
where do we stand with the process so as

124
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,120
you can imagine we need to prepare for

125
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,000
that one

126
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,919
and that was a lot of work but still in

127
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,320
the parallel the great king of caps and

128
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,639
us

129
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,360
were on the uh very going forward and we

130
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,680
have now really strong broken committee

131
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,120
uh and we have a very strong program

132
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,680

whole back then she didn't really know

137
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,080
what the situation will be

138
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,000

again to everybody that helped us and

221
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
there's actually one group and one very

222
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,080
important group i forgot this

223
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,280
is my fault maya kulpa

224
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,599
let's do a big round of virtual applause

225
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,240
for all of our sponsors

226
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,800
running such big events is not for free

227
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,599
and

228
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,919
this is actually quite a costly thing

229
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,680
and be really grateful to all the

230
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,520
sponsors that have

231
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,000
stayed true to us that have supported us

232
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
even during these virtual uncertain

233
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,800
times i mean

234
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,400
none of the sponsors really knows what

235
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,199
it means sponsoring a virtual event

236
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,759
that support is greatly appreciated and

237
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,879
um

238
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,520
