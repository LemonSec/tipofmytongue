1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,939
as a result of this

2
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:05,089
experimental work a module was developed in

3
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:07,160
sleeps that sleeps is a tool is

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,950
unidese open source elaborates this work

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,580
if they are joint with the

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,830
stratum fia laboratory next to the

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,829
technical university of the czech republic in prague

8
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:21,349
so good we use this tool and

9
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:23,779
well a little to finish the

10
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:26,599
related lines of work well when

11
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:29,720
we work in cybersecurity we know that

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,439
the detection of malware and attacks

13
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,910
by analyzing network traffic

14
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,260
continues to be a challenge today even

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,790
though there are many tools and many

16
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,940
techniques it is still difficult to count on

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,520
efficient detection systems and to

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,780
separate what is malicious behavior

19
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,440
from normal what is the reason for this

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,510
good because normal traffic is

21
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,960
extremely complex diverse

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,230
changing new applications emerge

23
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,750
traffic varies if

24
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,209
malicious actions also change they migrate they

25
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:06,050
hide

26
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,340
there is a large quantity  of data to be analyzed

27
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,160
in order to carry out  detection, and

28
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,440
for it to be useful, it must occur

29
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,790
almost in real time,

30
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,940
so although there are

31
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,830
interesting proposals to apply

32
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,530
ensemble techniques to what

33
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,680
security is, there are two aspects that have not yet been

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,510
studied, which is the use of

35
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,570
fred intelligence data  in

36
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,210
sembler ning algorithms for example the information

37
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,090
that gives us total virus and there are also no

38
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,010
ensemble algorithms that work

39
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,229
based on time in detection if

40
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,550
there are today many works

41
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,380
regarding detecting attacks or detecting something in

42
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,900
particular using machine

43
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,509
learning techniques  that is, creating

44
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:59,520
a model from the data and then using that

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,440
model to predict whether ensemble

46
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,390
learning is a bit like combining

47
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,640
different machine

48
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,699
learning techniques for this, yes, and well,

49
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,649
in this particular case, applying it to the

50
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,840
detection of infected jose, then

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,850
by  On the one hand, the methodology was designed

52
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,550
to detect infected eyes in the network

53
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,310
using ensemble hernia, on the other hand,

54
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,890
establishes a procedure to test

55
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,970
the methodology

56
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,630
yes using real data 7 and the results

57
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,770
of these experiments and

58
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,050
the implementation was designed, as I said,

59
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,730
of the integrated internal fire module

60
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,790
sleeps yes in the framework of a

61
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,890
joint collaboration work with

62
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,300
strata loses

63
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,460
good as  we did it with how we did

64
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,770
this technique of this methodology of

65
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,240
detection of infected jose well

66
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,850
we work with network flows we apply

67
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,280
in semler ning in different stages and

68
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,460
now I am going to tell you and we include information

69
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,350
in one of those stages in the last one in

70
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,900
particular we include information from  be

71
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,690
smart in the detection process

72
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,910
well and below

73
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,380
some graphs appear that have to do with

74
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,710
this network flow they are assembled by dyn

75
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,630
which is the combination of different

76
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,640
models to take the best of each

77
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,400
model and arrive at a more

78
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,620
efficient decision  When classification is done,

79
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,810
these are techniques that are

80
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,400
generally used for different problems of

81
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,410
classification what we want to

82
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,230
do here is to finally arrive at the

83
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,930
result of whether children are infected or

84
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,740
not yes and well and it seems that we are going to make

85
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,840
consumers of intelligence stress information

86
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,190


87
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,280
as I was telling you for those who do not

88
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,890
know it how to introduce the slips

89
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,480
is  a

90
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,830
modular intrusion prevention system that is

91
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,210
developed in python they have

92
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,520
classifiers they classify the flows of

93
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,470
100 no flow is malicious a

94
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,050
network flow is malicious it does not work in

95
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,060
time windows yes the tool is configurable

96
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,480
and well it also implements and

97
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,980
is under development

98
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,780
new modules are under development that provide information

99
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,020
on intelligence stress

100
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,480
here is the reference in case you want to

101
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,760
take it well what the work consisted of

102
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,390
as I told you this methodology was

103
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,880
developed in phases as you can

104
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,640
see on the right in phase 1

105
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,370
we have flows of  network and for

106
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,400
each flow the sleeps tool

107
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,190
offers us different results without ma flows

108
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,780


109
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,910
based on different classifiers that it

110
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,070
applies then the idea is to apply

111
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,560
join there that is to say combine the

112
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
results of these different

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,130
classifiers the slits to obtain

114
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,220
a single decision per flow then in

115
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,000
phase 2

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,310
the idea is to group the flows according

117
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,950
to what type of  traffic is dealt with here well,

118
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,450
it should be noted that we are talking about

119
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,250
established established and depp

120
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,870
established not established although

121
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,760
we know that vp has no states but

122
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,430
well we call it established here traffic

123
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,090
and pp for which there are answers the

124
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,890
messages will have more luck than they have

125
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,660
answers and  not established

126
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,200
otherwise then in phase 2 what we are

127
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,870
going to have is a decision

128
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,390
to the entire set of flows that goes from

129
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,580
a source to a destination if in a

130
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,440
particular time window taking

131
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,110
as data analyzing what happens with the

132
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,480
traffic of  sepe established not

133
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,100
established what is preset and not

134
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,280
established and finally in phase 3

135
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,740
we are going to do ensemble for classif  icar

136
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,320
the hosts almost the origin jose if the

137
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,050
origin ip addresses that we have among

138
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,480
our data saying they are getting

139
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,640
infected a little by combining the

140
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,040
information that comes as a result

141
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,470
of phase 2 with the information of being

142
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,280
intelligence

143
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,830
well then we are going to improve the

144
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,870
detection of the infected  based on

145
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,820
the different predictions for each

146
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,550
network flow of the set of

147
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,080
malicious behavior alerts that are

148
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,240
associated with the ip and the data

149
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,890
provided with the different it sources

150
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,490
regarding the destinations with

151
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,940
which jose's ojos communicates, the idea is to

152
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,800
apply  ensemble or to decide

153
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,600
as I told you in each stage in the

154
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,340
first if the flow is malicious normal

155
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,680
in the second if the set of flows

156
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,150
that goes from a source to a destination is

157
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,250
part of an infection and in the third

158
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,560
if the sica address  source ip is

159
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,009
infected or not

160
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:41,999
good then in the first stage the

161
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,400
level is when you apply the

162
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,550
classification for an element you get

163
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,409
a le  ibel not in this case the level

164
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,449
represents the decision regarding the flow

165
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:54,360
indicating if it is malicious normal and at

166
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,089
this stage what we did was ensemble and

167
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:59,969
to obtain a single decision and what we

168
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:01,919
tried were different

169
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,249
machine learning algorithms to see good

170
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:07,649
from these  different resulting labels

171
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:11,580
combine them and obtain a final decision

172
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,550
then the training when one

173
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,279
applies these techniques the training

174
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,639
is done to learn the model in this

175
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,039
case what we learned from the training

176
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,839
was which was the best algorithm the same

177
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,849
learning between known algorithms that

178
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:28,469
exist between known techniques  that

179
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:31,650
exist to classify the flow

180
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,930
in the second phase as I told you the

181
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,669
decisions for the set of flows

182
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:37,860
that goes from some source to a destination and for the

183
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,830
entire set and in particular here we

184
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,270
established the decision levels

185
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,820
first we labeled each group of flows

186
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,560
between the groups  those who

187
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,810
told them what the set of

188
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,389
flows are  of s&p established the tcp not

189
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:54,090
established the set of vp flows

190
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,669
established and not established yes and a

191
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:58,919
second level of decision where we

192
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,110
label the total set based on

193
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,020
the

194
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,750
number of malicious flows of a

195
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,330
certain type and the percentage of

196
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,849
malicious flows of a certain type  and

197
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:14,419
well and in the third phase we add what

198
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:16,909
we know in the second for each

199
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:18,830
destination we are going to have from the

200
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,319
second phase a decision that has to

201
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,729
do with the entire set of flows that

202
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:25,400
goes from the origin to that destination and we are going to

203
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,319
add the  information of being

204
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:30,620
intelligence for said destinations yes

205
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,890
and based on these to these two to these two

206
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,339
data we are going to make a decision for the

207
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:40,610
worst i hens indicating classifying it

208
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,470
as infected or not

209
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,670
good in particular in phase 3 we

210
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,410
consider using different sources in the methodology

211
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,570
of tea and the methodology

212
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,600
is defined in a general way

213
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,440
in order to be able to include different sources in

214
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,020
our work.

215
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,270
As a source of pti,

216
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,050
we tested it with virus total

217
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,580
and well, taking into account the

218
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,410
information that total blues provides and

219
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,779
that many of you surely know from

220
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:14,959
working on this if virustotal

221
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,459
gives me the

222
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:22,070
urls that they resolved on the lawn and related to an IP.  for it

223
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,950
is for that let's say for that category it

224
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,660
tells me the detections and non-detections it

225
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,360
is the same for the state samples nor

226
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,640
for the oil discharge samples it

227
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,280
also gives me detections and non-detection it

228
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,130
is the same for the category the

229
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,950
files that contain the IP  given yes

230
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,230
and the same for programs that

231
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,270
contact the given ip and for

232
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,950
all programs that contact and hit

233
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,170
stops and detections then

234
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,290
for each category what the

235
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,600
sleeps tool has a

236
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,020
virustotal module that consumes information from

237
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,100
virustotal and calculates a  proportion for

238
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,110
each one of these categories and in the

239
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,460
way that is indicated in the

240
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,220
presentation the positive detections

241
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,590
on the number  total tests that are

242
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,810
done for wear for the url category

243
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,420
for the category of 'la loba' for the

244
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,850
category of referrals and communications and

245
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,279
what are these that are at the top,

246
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,699
well based on that there is a lot of

247
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:27,920
calculation and well some questions

248
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,529
also of statistics  in the work

249
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,800
try not to include so much of that so

250
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,999
that it is understood but well for

251
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,279
completeness some things if what

252
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,680
matters here is to say well each one of

253
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,850
these tests each one these

254
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,069
proportions in our methodology each

255
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:45,709
one of these data let's say that we are going

256
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,769
to  get finally we give it a weight yes

257
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:50,120
to include the

258
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,059
virustotal information and what we gave was a weight

259
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:58,819
for each ip to the url category for

260
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:00,680
all destinations and with which

261
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,110
it communicates and despite remember that now

262
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,579
we want to classify the

263
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:08,420
source ip yes  and the same as a weight for the

264
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,240
sum of that information for all the

265
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,790
destination IPs if it stops to include that

266
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,209
information and so on for the four

267
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,130
categories that you mention

268
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,380
for  to include the information of phase 2

269
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,570
what is going to be taken into account as I

270
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,780
said before is the number of sets

271
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,130
of flows that were classified as

272
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,370
malicious and for that source IP if

273
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,339
then it

274
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:39,730
seems like the destination IP if then with the

275
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,069
number of malicious destinations we go  to

276
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,829
have we are going to include the

277
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,270
phase 2 information yes

278
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,270
with a certain we call it pass two

279
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,190
borders with a certain value yes

280
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,250
based on what is the

281
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,690
classified quantity of the set quantity of

282
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,790
flows classified as malicious in

283
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,490
the previous phase yes and then good it is

284
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,860
all these data will be combined to

285
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,590
obtain the final decision in phase 3

286
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,190
yes according to a certain threshold no if

287
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,950
that value exceeds a certain threshold it will

288
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,320
be the origin it will be malicious the IP

289
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,840
that we are deciding if it is malicious

290
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,580
it will not be  malicious and

291
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,980
otherwise it will be classified as

292
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,740
normal, so this is the methodology,

293
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,080
that is, the decision criteria that

294
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,000
we take in each phase to classify and  The

295
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,770
flow to classify the set of

296
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,670
flows that goes from 6 p to a destination and

297
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,100
finally to classify the source IP

298
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,410
yes that is what we want

299
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,449
we did well we did experiments

300
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:43,370
so that to test these criteria

301
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,829
that we defined from these phases of the model

302
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:49,850
yes and to adjust them  yes we did it with

303
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,069
data to be real but I am going to tell you

304
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:53,629
what it is about

305
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:56,899
well we analyze the advantages of applying

306
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:59,660
in sem link with the objective of

307
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,579
precisely what we want to do to

308
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:04,560
detect the infected

309
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,740
also proofs of concept to later

310
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,050
implement this module really how

311
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,080
it was implemented in python for the

312
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,940
sleeps tool

313
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,630
good regarding the data is

314
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,940
the idea is good we have what we said

315
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,280
we are going to learn from the data to

316
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,870
generate a model after classifying

317
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,090
good what data do we learn good there are

318
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,330
data sets for different issues in

319
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,840
particular for cybersecurity us

320
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,260
for these experiments we use 3 data

321
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,060
sets that also have in the laboratory

322
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,290
stratum fia lab  in a project

323
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,570
called malware capture facility' project

324
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,820
there data sets are created from

325
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,180
infected and non-infected machines,

326
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,630
let's say in an isolated environment

327
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,550
and nothing is put in we are going to work on these

328
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,800
machines, some of them infected and other times

329
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,650
normal graphical malicious traffic is captured

330
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,740
and mixed here, well, I am going to point

331
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,660
out that some

332
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,259
learning or mazinger ning techniques

333
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:13,169
do not use unlabeled data and others

334
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:15,629
use labeled data, we use

335
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:17,459
labeled data, there is no label, it

336
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,649
is in the flows for us, from there

337
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:21,600
we start

338
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,149
to do these experiments and well

339
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:25,970
the data and then there is some

340
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,600
intermediate data that is generated during

341
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,209
this process so it is good that we

342
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:36,470
develop and implement it

343
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,400
well here you are sorry it is the reference

344
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,120
to the data it is good what that consists of

345
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,850
in each phase I have to train to

346
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,800
establish the best model  because I am the

347
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,980
criterion but then there are thresholds and there are

348
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,710
percentages there are amounts and based on

349
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,180
that  decides then I have to

350
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,670
establish the values of those variables and t

351
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,670
define which is the best model that 

352
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,220
s done in training as testi

353
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,700
g and measuring how each 

354
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,550
odel works and I keep the best yes with 

355
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,350
he one that gives me the best metrics for that 

356
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,040
or  to see which one is better is to use

357
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,800
metrics that are calculated from the

358
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,100
confusion matrix yes well here you can

359
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,130
see a confusion matrix that is used

360
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,830
for binary classification yes where

361
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,610
we have we can calculate based on the

362
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,440
leiv the real one that as I told you we

363
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,810
have  the label here for each

364
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,460
flow we know which machines

365
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,050
are infected or not so we have

366
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,390
the known truth and we have the

367
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,970
prediction and based on that we can know

368
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:44,930
if I

369
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,200
detect malware and it is more the uars and that

370
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,390
is a true positive oh yes it detected

371
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,060
sorry yes  decree malware was detected and

372
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,880
in reality normal if we have a false

373
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:02,089
positive and so it was not detected normal and in

374
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:04,970
reality it is malicious it is a false

375
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,290
negative and if it was not detected  malware is like this

376
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,660
the prediction is normal and as far as

377
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,190
we know the truth known normal

378
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,170
well it is a true negative and

379
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,149
then based on this

380
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:20,390
confusion matrix that I can put together with the

381
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,700
results I can obtain different

382
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,089
metrics such as precision and other

383
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:28,520
metrics that tell me about  how

384
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,290
the models work

385
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,420
well that is also a bit technical

386
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,190
but well the important thing is that we use

387
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,990
metrics that are based on this

388
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,589
information and we also had that it is

389
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:42,829
important when one uses learning techniques to

390
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:44,990
define the percentage of

391
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,000
data that you use to train and the

392
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,350
percentage  of data that you use to

393
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,980
test if so that you don't get models

394
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,690
that fit very well with the data that

395
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,600
you used to train because suddenly they are

396
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,660
going to be very biased, that is,

397
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,680
be very oriented to that data

398
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,069
and well and then I need it to be that

399
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:08,500
the model is generalized and that it is

400
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,859
efficient to detect but that it is a

401
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,709
model that generalizes and that it serves for

402
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:20,020
different cases and good on the basis  to the

403
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,470
tests that we did in the experiments

404
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,459
what were the results that

405
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:27,910
we obtained well I am going to

406
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,960
comment on it by phases not in phase 1

407
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,520
we used in sebring to classify the

408
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,120
flows and here we implemented a decision

409
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,670
that combined the findings

410
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,380
what resulted  the different

411
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,440
classifiers are implemented in

412
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,429
sleeps in particular we try different

413
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:49,600
different techniques or

414
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,390
machine learning algorithms if anyone

415
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,360
who is going to learn about this who knows a

416
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,450
little about this is going to know that there are techniques

417
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,190
how bus team works well and different

418
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,520
techniques for  learn and then there are

419
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,140
techniques from the same link which is what I

420
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,760
know are used to combine in

421
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,860
particular there is a technique from the cem link

422
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,360
which is one of the simplest which is

423
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,640
the voting technique when we did the

424
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,530
tests we tried the different

425
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,029
gym boosting techniques

426
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:20,780
and others that exist and

427
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,410
we are left with the heavy voting technique

428
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,020
and which gives more weight to the

429
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,600
algorithm is going to be random fo  rest and to

430
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,300
classify the flow of notes

431
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,970
the results are a little bit and the conclusion

432
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,340
is that the weighted voting technique that is selected

433
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,160
ends up choosing in

434
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,350
this case decide using the

435
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,600
base algorithm that best classifies if you have

436
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
random forest

437
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,230
later in phase 2 good  Based on the

438
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,570
different tests, the criteria were tested.

439
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,340
We said that they had to do with

440
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,190
the quantity and percentage for each

441
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,830
group of flows and that there was a

442
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,140
percentage of malicious flows in

443
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,600
each of the groups with the values that obtai

444
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,450
ed the best results in the class

445
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,700
oom.  we are five minutes away but well if

446
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,840
we are already finishing it

447
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,710
was these and in particular these

448
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,049
two of these two combinations we are

449
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:21,620
left with the percentage of when the

450
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,570
amount of the threshold when the number

451
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:28,610
of malicious flows is greater than 0 and the

452
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,000
percentage is greater  that 25 so

453
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,529
that when a percentage of

454
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:36,250
malicious flows is less than this,

455
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,559
detections that could mean

456
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,320
false are not generated  positives well I am going to go a

457
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,580
little fast with the conclusions

458
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,830
because I was looking at the time but it is

459
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,179
seen that I was not fast enough

460
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,850
when applying assembly grouping the

461
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,539
flows by destination in each group by

462
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,039
protocol and by state it is possible to

463
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,080
detect malicious connections

464
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,909
based on the characteristics  of these

465
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:02,460
connections between origin and destination and, in

466
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,799
turn, the conclusion is that the decision is

467
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,769
by destination, which then leads to adding in

468
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:09,450
phase 3 the trade

469
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,009
intelligence information for each of the

470
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,549
destinations,

471
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:17,258
well in phase 3

472
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,480
in phase 3 we said that  We were going to

473
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,370
decide if a game was infected

474
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,500
or not, well, there are several variables that

475
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,380
intervene here, as I explained before, to

476
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,750
give weight to the information from

477
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,519
intelligence beings and also to give weight to

478
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:33,909
the information that comes from phase 2, yes,

479
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:36,009
in particular, what we are dealing with  to do

480
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:37,750
here

481
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,309
as several variables intervened to

482
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:42,100
decide the best model was to

483
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,269
minimize false positives and false

484
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:49,149
negatives and  In particular, to

485
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:51,100
minimize false negatives, we liked those

486
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,279
tups that were false negatives in

487
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:57,129
phase 2 if we analyzed what was happening that

488
00:20:57,129 --> 00:20:58,720
provided the information from 'the and for

489
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,700
these pairs and we realized that in

490
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,279
reality there was no contribution, note that the

491
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:05,700
values are all  zeros if in this case it

492
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,419
could be because the machine is

493
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:12,639
infected and it is scanning destinations

494
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,139
so the destinations are not actually

495
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,389
malicious they are victims of the scanning of

496
00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:18,340
the infected machine for example if

497
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,840


498
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,770
then well then we saw that we did not want to add

499
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,240
false negatives but we could not download

500
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,120
them either and  then, to minimize

501
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,830
false positives, what we tried to

502
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,270
do is find out what the limit was,

503
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:35,860
let's say in this case the

504
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,059
cipe that we knew were not infected see

505
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:41,260
when they connected to different

506
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,320
destinations that virustotal classifies in

507
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,240
some way as malicious good to see

508
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,669
the information  which gives me total virus

509
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:50,759
for those destinations,

510
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:55,469
that is, take a value as a threshold that

511
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:58,969
is higher  or yes to this one because if not I would add

512
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:01,360
'false positives'

513
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,080
well since I have little time left we are going to

514
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,630
round up the idea then

515
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:13,810
classroom ernesto pérez to say that day

516
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:17,980
is 22 ask if you can show the url

517
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,120
of the eclipse that went by very quickly  or if

518
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,150
not shared by the chat and now he

519
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,190
asks if you have carried out a

520
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,410
practical implementation of work and

521
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:33,650
how has it worked well

522
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,410
the results

523
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,870
of this let's say are the ones that are shown

524
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,150
in the experiment the ones that I am showing a little

525
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,250
that they have to do precisely

526
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,830
with  establishing the model and the

527
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,420
implementation that was made is

528
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,000
available in giza or I am not going to

529
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,670
show it in a module for sleeps that

530
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,200
is not in the slits version in

531
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,990
production but well that already depends on

532
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,450
those who maintain the tool but it

533
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,520
was done  and the module is available to

534
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,160
test and precisely what I was going to

535
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,370
tell you is that well, a bit of the work

536
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,650
that follows now is to test this in

537
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,200
our environment, that is, now I

538
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,570
tell you with what id  eas for now and to

539
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,240
round with the space the url of

540
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,740
sleeps by the by the chat

541
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,840
the idea was precisely to make an

542
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,550
ensemble module that takes the results

543
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,440
of the classifiers for each one of

544
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,230
the flows

545
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,690
and takes the information from the module

546
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,669
virustotal of sleeps and  of others and

547
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:33,830
could also be extended to other

548
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,150


549
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,890
intelligent stress information modules the tool that is being

550
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,220
implemented well decides if a host

551
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,710
is infected or not if to implement

552
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,510
this what were used were the models

553
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,490
that I obtained from the experiments that is to say

554
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,590
the values of  the variables of the

555
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,990
thresholds of the percentages and what is the

556
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,330
ensemble algorithm to use in the first

557
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,700
phase with these results the

558
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,160
experiments the sleeps module was implemented

559
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,309
yes the idea could be to

560
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:03,440
also implement the training in leeds yes

561
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,030
to go for this to be  keep adapting

562
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,780
to new threats I don't know if I'm clear with

563
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,320
this

564
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,750
and then also thinking about the

565
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,750
application well we are you in

566
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,539
lp  We use different external feeds and

567
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,240
to determine if there is a host

568
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,009
of the university network, it is part of a

569
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:25,559
botnet.

570
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:30,539


571
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,330


572
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,460


573
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,009
be looked at described currencies but

574
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,350
not because we relate the information

575
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,080
provided by the different films and

576
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,059
we have them integrated into our

577
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,230
incident management system and once we

578
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,769
trust each source of information

579
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:51,509
we take let's say that information we do not

580
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:53,950
combine it

581
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,789
if we combine it we could improve the

582
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,559
data that we have to determine if a

583
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:03,130
jose is infected or not if then in

584
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,600
some way the developed ensemble module

585
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,909
could be integrated on the one

586
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:09,190
hand as a fi of internals to ours

587
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,649
is to gradually incorporate it as a

588
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:14,620
precisely integral mechanism to detect the

589
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,110
infected in the network and  also in the future

590
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,799
and add it physio and we use it

591
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,669
independently as a source of

592
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:23,409
input  a for phase 3 of our

593
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:25,450
ensemble process if in this way

594
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:29,380
this is what the work that I want to

595
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,409
start you now applying this proposal

596
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:37,389
in ours is to say the idea the idea to

597
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:39,760
continue working and well

598
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,070
many lines of research and

599
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,620
development are also opened  as well as the one I

600
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,210
was just saying about including other

601
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,309
intelligent network sources in phase 3 of the

602
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:50,679
leeds integral methodology and our

603
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,410
December module

604
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,040
from Ciro to another and analyzing the

605
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,080
effectiveness of the methodology

606
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,030
in the day-to-day of the  implemented methodology,

607
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,640
although they are data sets with

608
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,830
real data and well, tests were carried out

609
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,580
and

610
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,779
they turned out to be what

611
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:15,010
we commented on and this is already there but this

612
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,960
is not the last good and also analyze

613
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,779
how this can be applied to

614
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:23,980
batch traffic yes and something else  which is good

615
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,279
for those who are dedicated to research and

616
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,440
want to try things is also the issue

617
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,909
of generating data sets for

618
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:34,630
cybersecurity because well, there is not

619
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,519
a lot of this the truth is that when

620
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:39,039
I started studying this I did not find much

621
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,260
good condition I had what provided me

622
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,139
stratum fia to the side but there is not much of

623
00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:46,600
much in the available let's say the

624
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,019
internet or that someone works with this

625
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:52,840
so it's another other  another

626
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,330
interesting line to work on, well, the

627
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,639
complete exposition, sorry if I went on for a

628
00:26:57,639 --> 00:26:59,980
few minutes, that I should have

629
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,169
cut down more, it offends the

630
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:06,279
complete exposition is in this url of the work

631
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:08,070
where there are some more technical details,

632
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,990
there is my contact and now I'll pass you

633
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,790
through the chat while

634
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,880
the  event fields that could go through the

635
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,390
chat in the links that you were asked for and

636
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,780
also this exhibition on youtube and if

637
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,680
you have your work it is posted

638
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,850
somewhere too

639
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,940
and well thank you very much paula and tenor go

640
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,330
ahead for the opportunity grace no

641
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,990
thanks to you and well  now we are going to

642
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,720
continue

643
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,340
how are you all we are going to continue with the

644
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,980
next talk that will be given

645
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,470
by guillermo pereyra what that analyst is to

646
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,539
say  from the security analyst clinic,

647
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:55,230
that is to say from lacnic and guillermo,

648
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,419
he is going to be talking to us about the dns open

649
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:00,900
resolver with ip version 4 this

650
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,549
detected here in the region of

651
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:08,020
latin america and the caribbean

652
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,510
please see the chat in fordo don't

653
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:16,900

if it looks good and you can hear it

658
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,140
great great well I'm going to present the

659
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,210
project we carried out last year

660
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,580
with the people of  that being of that

661
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,990
day with ernesto and punt

662
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,590
is a project to detect the 'open

663
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,640
resolvers in the region not only from

664
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,540
identifying them or with resolver but

665
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,730
alerting those affected

666
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,520
and in addition to evaluating the effectiveness of

667
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,760
the communication channels what was the

668
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,779
young álvaro warn  to those affected,

669
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:12,570
well, I am going to increase them, know that it is a

670
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,719
new solver, not to solve, it is a

671
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:19,559
dns server that accepts queries that

672
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,570
are standards, the board in

673
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,389
recursive queries if it is open to the internet

674
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:26,039
, therefore  anyone on the internet can

675
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:29,989
carry out recursive queries

676
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:32,980
I am going to tell you why it is a problem it

677
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,500
has several several problems

678
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,230
one of the problems develops they are

679
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:43,260
susceptible to amplification attacks

680
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,299


681
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,129
for those who do not know an

682
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:50,489
amplification attack an attacker this went to the

683
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:53,190
ip  of origin

684
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,130
then he makes a query to this

685
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,340
loudmouth solve this with resolve that

686
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,110
having the law p of origin is trusted

687
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:05,490
goes from the answer goes to the victim

688
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:08,330
as there are thousands of govern resolvers

689
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,570
on the internet they can be used

690
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,710
massively also if the attacker

691
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:18,320
has thousands  of bots or botnets how do

692
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,929
you look

693
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:22,950
at their command

694
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,800
make thousands of recursive queries

695
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,100
using a thousand miles of ocon solve

696
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,530
here I leave you

697
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:35,520
a document by cristian rosso

698
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,340
that achieved in

699
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,320
laboratory environments an amplification of between

700
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,020
28 and 64 times

701
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,370
of the answer I in the  practice

702
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:51,000
find amplification is 17 18

703
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,780
times the original query so it's

704
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,100
quite problematic

705
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,730
another  type of attack

706
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,890
this type of attack is known as

707
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,160
phantom note

708
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,370
the attacker needed the pointer

709
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,700
the attacker makes a query with

710
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,870
resolver but makes the query

711
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:21,370
to an authoritative server under his

712
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:24,309
command then they threaten to

713
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:27,000
query this server

714
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:31,200
this authoritative server  they send n

715
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,110
subdomains as a response then

716
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,310
special of course

717
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,440
or with r and they only receive all this

718
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,410
subdomain if they make the request to the

719
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,730
victim

720
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,830
and this is multiplied

721
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,220
and even more says

722
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,299
the amplification factor I leave you the

723
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:00,780
link of this type of attack that there are

724
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,840
several  Variants that can make

725
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,350
the multiplication factor of the attack very large can be

726
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,709


727
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:15,160
found online, they explain how to

728
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,810
eliminate this problem, apart from removing it,

729
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,720
as with solving, others must be adjusted, such

730
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,990
as the limit king, not accepting it, so many

731
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,510
answers

732
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,400
in that link, it explains better

733
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,150
other possible problems, of course

734
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,270
that we have one but resolve are

735
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,160
susceptible to having unwanted traffic

736
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,170
in your being  vidor

737
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,730
anyone can make queries to your

738
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:47,350
server it is not very desired

739
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,880
street poisoning these the

740
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,600
most modern servers known

741
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,110
as bain

742
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:59,250
come it is almost difficult to do it

743
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,380
but there are servers that can still

744
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,929
poison the cache like old versions

745
00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:06,890
and from bain for example

746
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,410
what  means way the gas

747
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:13,040
the attacker performs a query for

748
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,400
example he makes a query not with

749
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,280
resolve tells him that you have google flu

750
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,950
has google

751
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,409
and tries before the planes

752
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:26,039
from google's authoritative or answers the

753
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,659
poison and say neither I nor p is that of

754
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:31,230
google  For example

755
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,890
, malicious tunnels can be made,

756
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,550
for example, botnets,

757
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,740
many times in companies,

758
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,150
all traffic is blocked, but they leave

759
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,070
the ns traffic open so that they can

760
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,170
browse the Internet,

761
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,910
then the benefits of these open

762
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,430
resolvers to communicate ecologically with

763
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,190
the bots

764
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,940
within the  machines and thus be able to exit the

765
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,160
tunnels in s

766
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,290
and connect with the command in control

767
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,010
of the bot

768
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,860
net through existing domains because they

769
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,860
can do good on the network to

770
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,600
carry out attacks on domains that do not

771
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,280
exist these consume the processing

772
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,750
of the random dns server they

773
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,790
are similar attacks since the

774
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,529
queries to the existing sub domains are

775
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:26,259
malicious queries as I had

776
00:34:26,259 --> 00:34:29,559
previously explained separately  Of the variant

777
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:34,480
that I mentioned to you, there are variants such as

778
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:41,310
slow responses or good savings,

779
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:47,380
it does not allow the price to drop, it also

780
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,760
leaves it with processing the servers and

781
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,219
removes it is tragically malicious

782
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:56,460
between it and a little

783
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,000
and how

784
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,080
the IP is used for attacks from  in solving the

785
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,760
server it may remain or the range may

786
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,450
remain within blacklists

787
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,390
I worked before using al acne

788
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:15,410
an icp worked and in solving

789
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,780
within the daily attacks that there are

790
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,510
denial of services it is used

791
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,870
according to note solve

792
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:28,850
some external statistics

793
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,609
the shadows server  you can see that they

794
00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:34,920
remain globally at 2 million

795
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,130
people

796
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,700
on the entire internet

797
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,650
there  some statistics

798
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:48,270
from south america we receive some

799
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:51,270
hits from soul server if you have a

800
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:54,000
y sp you could solo will give it to willow

801
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,890
roquel it is more of the list you must solve

802
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:00,740
what affected you have on the

803
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,819
network

804
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:04,609
here I show you what he published shows

805
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:06,970
but recently he

806
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,930
top in the top of

807
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:14,200
denial of service attacks for attacks in the

808
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,880
first place we have without a click of

809
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,950
course they follow follow the lead they

810
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:22,940
send the packet and pay with the signa

811
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,380
deactivated the flag zinc

812
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,490
the victim responds with the

813
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,590
cinar responds ballack but of course  the

814
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,230
attacker does not respond to him and that

815
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:39,050
keeps him shopping processing the response

816
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,540
waiting for the response the same with 9

817
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,840
with rest

818
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,360
in fourth place we have years to solve

819
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,090
that they are used to know the

820
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,109
attacks

821
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,420
so we have

822
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,160
them there I wanted to mention that we have two

823
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,549
projects of  with resolve it is carried

824
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,760
out with the r & d area

825
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,020
this was active

826
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:09,090
detection of open resolver with ipv6 this

827
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,750
is used he

828
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:15,410
the  Verse that has the click

829
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,260
hypersixes are extracted that diction consults the

830
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,020
reverse server it is verified that it is one

831
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:25,900
with resolve and the executed one is notified

832
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,570
a lot of servers were downloaded

833
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:33,350
in the project this is active it continues

834
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:36,870
sending alerts and last year at the

835
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,570
moment  With Mr. de Sella,

836
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,980
the identification of the

837
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,040
open resolution in the region was carried out and those affected were challenged.

838
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,530
Now I am going to show you

839
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,029
some of the results of this,

840
00:37:49,029 --> 00:37:51,429
the affected environment of course with a miracle or

841
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:53,640
by mail

842
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,400
in the project stage is first  the

843
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,650
identification of the other prisoners and

844
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,500
then alert those affected I

845
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,470
leave the link

846
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,190


847
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,680
so that you can see more details of the

848
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,220
projects

849
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,140
well I will tell you how the

850
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,660
mechanism is to identify one with laughter

851
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,990
pain

852
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:22,009
yes yes having an IP is easy to do  an

853
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:26,269
appointment with I say and the IP you want to see

854
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:28,609
if the aircraft is a promise or in that one

855
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:31,609
that luca can also be used with

856
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,979
images more has some hits to

857
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:36,349
carry out this consultation  ta automatically

858
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:38,329
more scanners the same as on the map

859
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:41,239
but it can be done massively and

860
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:44,150
we have help in health server absences it

861
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,829
also

862
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:48,660
identifies our types

863
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,930
of problems d I told them already observe it can

864
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,630
give you if that is an index for a

865
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,220
scene you have a decent  can

866
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,240
provide the ips that are a compressor in

867
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,940
your network in some results of

868
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,859
last year they were identified based on

869
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:11,099
this set of 36 thousand p

870
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:15,150
thousand 65 always going down in these and small

871
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,010
that were identified at the beginning they were

872
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:20,250
extracted from the d

873
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,890
they were distracted from the delight  from the

874
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,200
lacnic standard

875
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,490
they brought them the ips they

876
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,280
were made with more scanners now they looked for

877
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,440
the ips that had the

878
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,260
p53 port open

879
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,140
and of these ips they made the con I say the

880
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,780
query if it is to see if they were or were

881
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,460
answered recursively they want to

882
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,670
collect for a  resolve or not

883
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:50,579
depending on drug is 36,000 and beer sheva we

884
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:52,470
based ourselves on the entire project with these 36

885
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,650
thousand

886
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,440
removing there were many we removed mexico and

887
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,130
brazil

888
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,710
we wanted work  jar in that part with a

889
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,930
unique level of reining mexico so it

890
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:06,770
is only what mexico and brazil are not

891
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:09,530
in the region they are not mexico and

892
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,620
brazil

893
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:16,359
some results of it we see as in

894
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:19,240
red they were lowering the amount of or with

895
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,509
let's solve

896
00:40:21,509 --> 00:40:24,030
the truth that  it worked

897
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,910
the warnings that we gave to

898
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,920
the associates

899
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,620
those in yellow we have those who have

900
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:35,550
the port open but they do not respond

901
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,040
that the portal has already declared and in red they

902
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,320
knew how to solve it what they do respond to

903
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,490
are the means we use to

904
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,280
send them to  Those affected sent it by

905
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,690


906
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,910
mail, we uploaded it to the platform in milan and

907
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,400
so that they could see it in the

908
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,829
word stands and a direct contact, we tried to

909
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:57,980
contact us to find a very

910
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,180
specific contact so that they could download

911
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,359
the open resolvers

912
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:07,369
and here we see that

913
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:09,499
direct contact and  by mail there were

914
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:10,980
two

915
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,540
direct contact normal body

916
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:17,550
was also the best result good

917
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,310
these are the comparison of at the end at the

918
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,470
beginning of the end of the project how many

919
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:25,380
s  with in solving of the total how much will it

920
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,570
solve well at the beginning that they

921
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,280
were doing percent and how much there was at the

922
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,600
end under a lot

923
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,210
the considerations of those alerted

924
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,950
responded to us about 3 percent of these

925
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,440
of those alerted by mail that we are in

926
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,740
the box they have in  judgment in

927
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,080
inheriting the box from god

928
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,080
or technique

929
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,440
we had many rebounds so we have to

930
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,270


931
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,840
correct those boxes that bounce lewis put

932
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,180
with boxes that do not exist

933
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,040
we find

934
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,520
as in the case of success some 2 and sps

935
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:11,370
that had hundreds of vulnerable cpi

936
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,500
one  one of them corrected it by modifying the

937
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,240
firmware the provider asked him to

938
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,820
modify the firmware but we could

939
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,380
not he could not modify the firmware so

940
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:24,630
only with all the gp and lost

941
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,120
to block the port as leaders

942
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,530
development by pain please

943
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,410
in general the sending of empty mails was

944
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:37,160
the best option I leave you the link for

945
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,890
the best practices to not apply in

946
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,630
the acb

947
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:44,440
one of the best practices not to leave

948
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,980
open to  the queries of next

949
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:53,060
I will see if I do a little demo as

950
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,060
I am on time grace very fast very

951
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,200
slow

952
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,500
I tell you because, however, these are the

953
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,740
times for we are you have time you have

954
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,200
five minutes to show and in your

955
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,509
some question that they want to ask you

956
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,840
in some  recommendations confirm the

957
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,100
servers so that they do not allow

958
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,810
external queries to our website we have

959
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,760
some recommendations for some

960
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,820
known servers to avoid is that the end of the

961
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,310
ip by those of the 10 ep in this would

962
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:33,440
not have happened if from the day spm they

963
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,839
had prevented me from studying the  ip

964
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,980
and in the case of cpd correct it with

965
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,920
firmware or place a firewall otherwise if

966
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,460
it is not possible

967
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:51,849
and you make any query write

968
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:54,490
lacnic dot net ominami que pereira

969
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:57,220
rob learning dot net or go to

970
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,200
our website our website to see the

971
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,299
details of the project

972
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,490
you will see production

973
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:11,050
well thank you very much I'm going to see if

974
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:15,970
guillermo paul bernal questions guillermo

975
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:18,400
have they evaluated additional options for

976
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,670
incentives  help those affected to solve

977
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:25,270
their eyes resolve to solve what do you

978
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:28,960
mean why to help them

979
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,090
solve it will only be I suppose it runs a

980
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,790
hundred

981
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:39,920
this well

982
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,220
what we wanted to do is leave it

983
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,400
active that it be with it

984
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,500
concurrent I'm fine keep alerting us

985
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,400
and once a month or  create a value for them

986
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,990
apart from the associates who can

987
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,700
enter and see their

988
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,330
security problems work more attractive so that

989
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:02,720
they

990
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,390
can enter and see but I don't know

991
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:09,210
it hasn't occurred to me

992
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,820
and encourage them

993
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,150
in some way to

994
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:20,000
solve one we communicate

995
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,570
with our associates via mail  As

996
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:28,700
we said, we can do a

997
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:32,270
stricter follow-up of the cases,

998
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:35,650
but we are open to the

999
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,170
fact that you are a good member of the community.

1000
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,330
Obviously, we cannot make suggestions, so

1001
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:44,080
there are the contacts there for us to

1002
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,470
finally get to know the private emails

1003
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:51,940
and there is also the box, that is, to

1004
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,450
