01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,370
many times we do not know that we are

525
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:42,660
first and we exist and two networks

526
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:45,300
directly is that it happens in our of

527
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,880
our genetics directly as such and

528
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,980
well then well to start well a

529
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:52,350
little  Who am I? I am the founder of the

530
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:54,330
group. I have approximately 15 years of

531
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:56,850
experience in the area of security. I do no

532
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:58,680
know if that is for good or for bad. I am in charg

533
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,140
of it at the show cert and a

534
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,790
the level of Central America and the Caribbean, but w

535
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:04,650
have brought kings focus

536
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:06,420
d on the network.  own blog

537
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:08,820
specifically focused are the ones that

538
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:10,860
everything in the financial sector right and you

539
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,870
see that this is a little bit because it is my

540
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:14,790
person directly and something important

541
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:16,830
that I always like to teach is good

542
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:18,780
guatemala who where is that

543
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,980
really well we are

544
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:23,820
guatemala we are there short in  the country

545
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:25,620
of eternal spring is the house of

546
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:27,690
black beans a beer

547
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:30,109
is very good they taste the directly

548
01:07:30,109 --> 01:07:32,220
p  Mayan pyramids and the only good

549
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:33,690
movie that I think we all saw to

550
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:36,000
stress now that episode 4 shares

551
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,829
screens air from us directly

552
01:07:37,829 --> 01:07:40,589
as such it is really something that if

553
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:42,000
all Guatemalans want to

554
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,980
ask them is a lot of apologies right

555
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:45,210
why we had an epic fail

556
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:47,579
a couple of years ago we said that the world

557
01:07:47,579 --> 01:07:50,160
was going to be destroyed and it was the end of the world

558
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,770
in 2012 and it didn't happen so a thousand

559
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:55,140
apologies but right now I think maybe

560
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:57,030
it is and we see it on a technical level

561
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:58,710
maybe we had to do a hitler  With the

562
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:00,720
numbers directly and how

563
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,210
things are going, I think we are going close, so

564
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:04,560
I say, well, there are a thousand

565
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,990
apologies, but I think

566
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:09,150
the day will come directly, but well, let's

567
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:10,950
put on a little bit and asteries to the

568
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:13,349
day of today  specifically

569
01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:15,930
and the idea is to think specifically or

570
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:17,910
as I informally call

571
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:19,080
this talk three tales from the crypt

572
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,569
volume one we are going to see a little bit

573
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:23,310
of phishing cases in the region  the

574
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:25,140
ransomware postponing webber of

575
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,939
course there must be true

576
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:29,790
ATMs something that seems not much is

577
01:08:29,790 --> 01:08:31,710
known directly we are going to see a

578
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:33,750
little bit of that and finally a little bit

579
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:36,120
if you feel a denial of service

580
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,189
so well then starting specifically

581
01:08:38,189 --> 01:08:39,930
with the first part well the

582
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:41,250
phishing issue I think that

583
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,080
we all know phishing anymore it is not about coming here to

584
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,460
talk about what a physicist is but

585
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:46,140
basically because they are taken like

586
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,850
amputation this as it has been changing

587
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:49,589
inside our virgin we have that the

588
01:08:49,589 --> 01:08:51,390
typical physicist known directly as

589
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:53,100
such has  been all via

590
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,720
saved emails to we

591
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,950
specifically know that spam

592
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:58,229
emails specifically

593
01:08:58,229 --> 01:09:00,899
we upload some very specific ones or toys

594
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:02,939
but massive directly like for

595
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:04,649
example the vision tax agency

596
01:09:04,649 --> 01:09:05,939
where there are you have some taxes

597
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:08,339
you have to pay it or for example some

598
01:09:08,339 --> 01:09:09,930
credit issue  directly with the

599
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:11,130
superintendence band

600
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:13,439
they were already like a little  target directed

601
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:14,640
directly massive program

602
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,799
directly as such for it was not the

603
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:19,799
typical fe fishing the office 365 in

604
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:21,960
fishing the day email directly now

605
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,689
yes and that was and mutating directly

606
01:09:24,689 --> 01:09:26,910
so much that for example it is the second

607
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:29,460
source of phishing directly that we are going

608
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:32,130
to see from the  2017 2019 was already the

609
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:34,080
purchase of ads like adwords

610
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,939
specifically on google and then

611
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:38,009
basically people put the name of the

612
01:09:38,009 --> 01:09:38,899
bread with it

613
01:09:38,899 --> 01:09:40,969
directly and the first thing appears

614
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:43,069
makes them true many people do not know it and

615
01:09:43,069 --> 01:09:44,929
believe that there that is the real page

616
01:09:44,929 --> 01:09:46,969
of the bank  which is not, once

617
01:09:46,969 --> 01:09:49,640
someone has already bought ibex directly,

618
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,109
for example, because this was a modus

619
01:09:51,109 --> 01:09:53,658
operandi, the difficult issue, from 2018 to the

620
01:09:53,658 --> 01:09:55,520
present, is really

621
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,440
prolific, it is on social networks because,

622
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,060
by purpose, it is super easy to date

623
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:03,650
today or buy 100 pesos one from facebook

624
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:06,530
directly and the process is massified to the

625
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:08,719
region to the target of people to

626
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:10,370
what I specifically want  directly

627
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:13,040
true and well it is the last one that says to

628
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,110
go and no more and no less important because

629
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:16,400
the part is as always

630
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,080
social engineering true with basically it is already

631
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,020
getting the ugly 12 as from the user and that

632
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,550
because they were already used today we begin to

633
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:23,980
see techniques is  machine and beijing

634
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:25,969
directly where you can

635
01:10:25,969 --> 01:10:28,850
account and well some messages that

636
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:31,130
reached users where you have a

637
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:33,800
transfer withheld or there is something

638
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,750
suspicious and there they sent you the short

639
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:38,520
link directly so to

640
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,560
enter your credentials

641
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,390
technical peculiarities of this type of attack  true

642
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:44,340
because most of the deficits that we saw already

643
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:45,840
used guarin genes

644
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,520
specifically now not in the typical

645
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,550
normal phishing of the bank page there

646
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:52,830
were cars from argentina.com but it

647
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:54,780
already had a peculiar name or similar

648
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:57,240
interesting there will be something super interesting

649
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,550
I don't know how  the pitchers do it but they

650
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:03,390
identify the register that is the worst in

651
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:05,460
the world with his plane service but

652
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:08,070
then  seriously affect chip if you

653
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:09,570
want to be feeling use your

654
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:10,950
lip segment it

655
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:13,020
's horrible it's terrible it's fatal

656
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,810
directly if the length of stein that

657
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:17,820
these people answer start abyss

658
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,650
directly then the end if you stay

659
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,240
there with japan for a long time

660
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,760
directly true yes  all

661
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,500
users almost always trans on facebook

662
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,880
but everyone today is

663
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,090
using their phone and alone in scroll

664
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:31,710
score or scroll and they don't realize that

665
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:33,360
facebook now has ads in the middle of the feed

666
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,920
and it seems that it was announced

667
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,960
that it would be a page  from the bank but

668
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,489
it really isn't

669
01:11:38,489 --> 01:11:40,730
if they look for everything with tiny url

670
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:43,230
specifically true everyone already has

671
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:45,090
free applications from the script

672
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:47,579
thanks to the spray clip

673
01:11:47,579 --> 01:11:49,199
the free certificate for everyone was finished

674
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:51,210
and well they use free hosting with already

675
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:53,400
php programming or  with more data from

676
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,739
mysql for example with copper in in way

677
01:11:55,739 --> 01:11:58,380
directly now well basically they

678
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,480
went as the two denominators

679
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,429
we live in this type of  cases for

680
01:12:02,429 --> 01:12:03,650
which the most common has been proliferating

681
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:05,610
logically it affects more

682
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:07,499
sophisticated techniques directly because

683
01:12:07,499 --> 01:12:09,690
we can now enter the simpson stands and

684
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:11,039
we realized that the

685
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:13,110
filters themselves were no longer something it is normal

686
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:15,480
small that the accounts were sent

687
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,219
to an email x if not  that I already had a back

688
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:19,800
in an administration has been a

689
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,420
user atv it would be enough to be able to all the

690
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,860
users who are falling directly they

691
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:24,840
will see that there is basically I could

692
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:25,980
see all the users who are

693
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:27,749
falling basically all the users

694
01:12:27,749 --> 01:12:29,639
who have fallen by this type of scan

695
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:32,309
because they already had different chambers for

696
01:12:32,309 --> 01:12:34,349
the banks and for others specifically

697
01:12:34,349 --> 01:12:35,940
as such and well then we say well

698
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:38,369
and now in our world or in our

699
01:12:38,369 --> 01:12:40,260
region what do all these people do with

700
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,730
our stolen credentials and other

701
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:42,809
truth well there

702
01:12:42,809 --> 01:12:43,449
must be

703
01:12:43,449 --> 01:12:46,090
because there is massively everything  this

704
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:47,829
hard guy straight good and

705
01:12:47,829 --> 01:12:49,780
we find the black market if there is a

706
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:50,679
black market

707
01:12:50,679 --> 01:12:52,840
at the end of the day if there is  demand to see

708
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:53,769


709
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:56,019
the typical offer then with the

710
01:12:56,019 --> 01:12:57,400
black market if we find groups on facebook

711
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,889
specifically where apparently

712
01:12:59,889 --> 01:13:02,800
people x specifically were making

713
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,880
payments of 50 percent discount on

714
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,409
services things like that like

715
01:13:08,409 --> 01:13:11,380
this I paid this person on facebook  50

716
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:11,920
pesos

717
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,959
he paid me a debt that I had

718
01:13:13,959 --> 01:13:16,030
in a telephony or in a

719
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:21,550
water or electricity service I always had 50 yes

720
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:23,559
incredible but true and you who

721
01:13:23,559 --> 01:13:25,150
believe that this type of thing does not

722
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,309
proliferate it proliferates so much that it is

723
01:13:27,309 --> 01:13:30,209
counted and  the likes appear in a couple of

724
01:13:30,209 --> 01:13:32,709
posts directly where they said this

725
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:35,530
person to read or if you pay 50 and a half if me

726
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:37,869
and I pay my hundred payment for your excellent

727
01:13:37,869 --> 01:13:40,059
service if you have discounts but it

728
01:13:40,059 --> 01:13:41,800
really wasn't that the person

729
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,539
provided any type of services but

730
01:13:43,539 --> 01:13:45,070
that  they were with stolen passwords

731
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:47,139
possibly with which it generated in

732
01:13:47,139 --> 01:13:48,489
transactions then something interesting

733
01:13:48,489 --> 01:13:50,020
sources not only centers

734
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:52,240
constructions to third parties or to ch

735
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,650
specifically  But they also did

736
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:55,230
some services, both

737
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:57,460
university payments taxes taxes

738
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:59,200
images of paying taxes from an

739
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:04,390
account stealing all this world

740
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:06,190
directly and how you

741
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:07,840
build or the whole scheme or

742
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,430
how this whole scheme works directly

743
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:11,140
basically we have the hacker that the

744
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,060
hacker  comes to a pop and page of the

745
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:15,400
total bank creates the ad on

746
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:18,370
facebook the victim and now he won 0-4

747
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:21,250
the false ad clicks on it and enters the

748
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:23,490
false bank places his credentials

749
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:25,240
automatically an

750
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,370
intermediary notifies a network of mules as he

751
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:28,900
we did it directly, right,

752
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:31,150
this intermediary had the

753
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:33,490
credentials, he obtains the atp and others, it was

754
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:34,900
a general, the direct transaction to

755
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,000
real black is basically that was the

756
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,160
whole auto scheme, the skin deep fishing,

757
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,260
specifically, that we have been able to

758
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:43,000
decipher directly over the years,

759
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,700
now, yes, and this  express is something that

760
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,010
has been proliferating quite a lot and quite

761
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:50,590
well just as we have had  Or well,

762
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:52,240
massive cases of hits and if

763
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,250
we also have walking, I think that everyone does not

764
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:55,810
know if they know the term fishing itself, it is

765
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:56,620


766
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:59,230
directed directly at you or at your fire chair,

767
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:01,030
specifically now, then it

768
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:03,280
will be that this happens if it happens and it has

769
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,050
happened quite a lot in the Mexican region

770
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:07,510
without many  Insurers specifically

771
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:10,690
have had problems with companies like

772
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:12,490
that, right, and what was interesting about

773
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:14,350
the technical peculiarities? This type of

774
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:15,730
friction is much simpler because at the

775
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:16,990
end of the day you find the

776
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:19,690
email on the site or the weather, and since

777
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:20,920
now everyone is already on  office

778
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,170
365 days in gmail it is easier to throw

779
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:25,660
an office swing I need directly

780
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:28,840
the person falls and does not have access to his

781
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,900
email and icons than the

782
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:34,060
business jargon to know how this

783
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,760
man sends war transfer and others so much

784
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,800
that once they called us to say  Look,

785
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,990
this happened to me and we sent stewart transfer and I got

786
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:45,040
the money back and I told him well,

787
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,680
we don't do magic directly bra  if the

788
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,830
green guard-rail was true directly

789
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:52,540
then this is something interesting that

790
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:54,280
is happening in the region

791
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,469
directly and we gave them the mind it

792
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:59,619
happens right well ending the issue

793
01:15:59,619 --> 01:16:01,059
of phishing because

794
01:16:01,059 --> 01:16:03,369
ram software issues have also happened right

795
01:16:03,369 --> 01:16:06,369
everyone is really up to date  ransomware issue

796
01:16:06,369 --> 01:16:08,199
as is but well it's the

797
01:16:08,199 --> 01:16:09,820
technical peculiarities I think my

798
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:12,429
partner for double points for example

799
01:16:12,429 --> 01:16:14,710
one of the instructions that we did a

800
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:16,030
forensic analysis as the instructions

801
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:18,039
went up and everything but at the end of the day

802
01:16:18,039 --> 01:16:20,139
it's the technical peculiarities that

803
01:16:20,139 --> 01:16:21,909
are the bases  specifically to sing

804
01:16:21,909 --> 01:16:23,559
first is a compromise networks by

805
01:16:23,559 --> 01:16:25,300
usual methods either brute bags with

806
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,460
injection or specific web attacks opens

807
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:29,829
a page with joomla a wordpress to

808
01:16:29,829 --> 01:16:31,269
see specifically with a mode of and

809
01:16:31,269 --> 01:16:33,670
specifically true then they enter

810
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:35,559
from the waiter to the line then

811
01:16:35,559 --> 01:16:36,880
to not do  nor in scales in internet

812
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,739
privileges either communicators turin

813
01:16:38,739 --> 01:16:41,199
admin focuses di  rightly they seek

814
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:42,849
confidential information and something very

815
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:44,619
peculiar all the cases that we have

816
01:16:44,619 --> 01:16:46,510
seen of dead branches already directed and

817
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:48,489
packages is that they seek information they

818
01:16:48,489 --> 01:16:50,320
try to find everything that can be

819
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,809
stolen directly now and after

820
01:16:52,809 --> 01:16:55,210
that to finish with a flourish a

821
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,070
low they throw the  gustav larsson web

822
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:59,889
liked franz hour is not the first thing

823
01:16:59,889 --> 01:17:01,239
that they want to become but

824
01:17:01,239 --> 01:17:02,500
the first thing is to deal with

825
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,020
information and some of that piled me up

826
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:06,010
more than making a

827
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:07,660
goal to return home to the whole network

828
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:09,580
directly so much that it was interesting

829
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:12,520
for  example see here a small one here you

830
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,290
can see an image where for example

831
01:17:14,290 --> 01:17:17,320
we find a widget or a lift

832
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,290
directly true as a vactor

833
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:21,430
directly on a machine true it is

834
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:22,810
basically exactly what we were

835
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:25,060
talking about now they are using power with

836
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:26,590
pss which specifically to

837
01:17:26,590 --> 01:17:29,200
download at the ram level  directly

838
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,560
then the total and to be able to compromise the

839
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,570
whole system something very interesting and

840
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:36,490
peculiar p  eculiar I don't know if you see that

841
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:38,890
image it's what are those image its

842
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:40,960
icons that I had above this image

843
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,800
this posta red yes well those who know it

844
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,370
is a daring antivirus working at

845
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:51,460
100% and below the 'rachel directly

846
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:54,160
so it's really interesting if this

847
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:58,030
is something  that it is necessary to identify it as it

848
01:17:58,030 --> 01:18:00,540
is as a security breach

849
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:05,280
entering the third case of those that we have

850
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,200
seen here, so let's enter the world of

851
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,570
ATMs, it is true that it is an ATM, if

852
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:10,890
you are going to see the definition of

853
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:12,210
Wikipedia, you are going to see what a

854
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:16,350
machine is  super sophisticated without a

855
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:19,140
needy human that generates money and is

856
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:20,010
magic

857
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:21,810
if at the end of the cb that it is a

858
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:24,300
super suggestive machine directly true if

859
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,070
something interesting was that in our

860
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:28,020
world directly in the years 2010 to

861
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:30,930
2015 the reality was this a

862
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:32,820
windows xp machine does not assure  there was nothing of

863
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:34,500
harden installed with the

864
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,850
success policy the policy is not known in

865
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:37,340
express next next tex tex mex

866
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,150
directly now yes

867
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:41,160
security products no  there was antivirus today he said

868
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,110
yesterday there was nothing directly he has the

869
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:45,600
ram robinson 6 car enabled he had no

870
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,580
password injured from following on facebook it

871
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:49,890
is basically enabled it was a

872
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,870
charles completely foresees a playground

873
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:54,480
to go play and well something interesting

874
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,820
was that we supervised chis well

875
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:59,520
we were seeing that  already in 2013, for

876
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,860
example, danielle regalado began to

877
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:03,450
say blanket that he began to see that there

878
01:19:03,450 --> 01:19:04,590
was already

879
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:06,780
a magazine from us in mexico despite

880
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:08,670
how this type of ATM attack alarms

881
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:10,800
and others, then it is exactly what

882
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,810
we said, this is already coming through

883
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:15,920
mexico  it's already coming through mexico

884
01:19:16,369 --> 01:19:20,040
and suddenly it came directly if you want

885
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,710
basically because we saw that these

886
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:24,270
types of attacks or threats already started

887
01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:25,650
within our region

888
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:27,750
remember that we had the part

889
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,400
of america and we began to see this type

890
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,860
of ATM network where

891
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:34,080
basically  These are some images of

892
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,510
two files and sections in an ATM

893
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:38,460
specifically where we identify the

894
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:40,980
malware as such true and well

895
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:43,110
basically already analyzing what that

896
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:45,150
file was we realized specifically

897
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:48,630
that it was already a malware directed towards the

898
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:50,730
gold mark specifically as such

899
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:52,440
true and we realized that it was a

900
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,599
service that was like restore system

901
01:19:54,599 --> 01:19:56,760
services and we can even get there  until the

902
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:59,550
day that value was placed directly

903
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:01,380
for something very interesting and peculiar to

904
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,969
this case, so for example if

905
01:20:02,969 --> 01:20:05,340
you do a little bit of the part of tn

906
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:07,650
in our sector in a segment the

907
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:10,190
world

908
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:12,239
there are 23 brands a day of beautiful

909
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:13,440
repetition there  two

910
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,090
predominant brands then the successful one was

911
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:17,130
how this one hit the other brand in

912
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:17,969
competition

913
01:20:17,969 --> 01:20:21,300
hahahaha this does not happen to us and

914
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,430
others and unfortunately after a couple

915
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:25,620
of weeks embassy I also see

916
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,390
them directly big we can

917
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:29,700
see that we found a rifle and

918
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,020
that they had left directly at an ATM,

919
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:32,640
true that it was basically

920
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:35,100
a boat, I was talking about part of a bat car

921
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,840
that  twitter is like this

922
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:39,030
we had the installation script

923
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:40,890
and it was successful and the nice thing was that it

924
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:42,390
told us until the end of the installation

925
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:45,090
have a good day look you already installed your

926
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,620
malware in your ATM I have a good day you are

927
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:49,530
going to have a coffee and right

928
01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:51,210
now yes  they did a little

929
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:52,680
reverse engineering of this malware

930
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,660
directly alive that this malware

931
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,520
was developed with your phone

932
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,950
where the blues of the accents were lowered

933
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:00,540
we can get to the code on the

934
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:01,830
side of the code we realized that it

935
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:03,989
was obfuscated because we already use

936
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:06,510
soccer and it is a  solution to be able to

937
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:08,520
search the internet code and we can get

938
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,690
to the

939
01:21:11,690 --> 01:21:14,130
key islands specifically so to be able to

940
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:16,140
make the fish from the atm directly

941
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:18,659
which logically having done it without

942
01:21:18,659 --> 01:21:21,659
another reproduction and logically it was a

943
01:21:21,659 --> 01:21:24,060
beauty to see that directly as such not

944
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,370
as the video  real but well you can

945
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:28,440
imagine the joy it was to make

946
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,020
the cashier do this they finally follow

947
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:33,600
a little bit of denial of  service

948
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,969
to finish as dessert directly

949
01:21:35,969 --> 01:21:38,010
right and it was so good I think we

950
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:40,080
are all extended today to issues

951
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,120
of denial of service this is

952
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:45,030
Uruguayan and from a screenshot we had of

953
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:46,590
a client

954
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:49,469
in Central America directly where they are

955
01:21:49,469 --> 01:21:51,000
only five seconds of the screenshot

956
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,679
right now it was basically

957
01:21:52,679 --> 01:21:55,650
a botnet from god directly in

958
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:57,600
the attack it became larger than 10

959
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,239
gigabytes something interesting is not remembered in

960
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:01,350
our country

961
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:04,330
the size has prey

962
01:22:04,330 --> 01:22:06,670
by then I think an attack

963
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:08,410
of this magnitude happens for us not only

964
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:10,480
motorcycle to  client but we see the

965
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,480
peoples ii-sp will completely do if it is

966
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:16,420
almost what kind of attack on north korea at the end

967
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:19,390
of the day they definitely kill us all with an attack

968
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:22,180
because it kills all the

969
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:26,080
bandwidth part directly

970
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,990
as such so well these are  some

971
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:31,360
little things that happen within the region

972
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,850
directly at the end although we are a

973
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:35,890
small country forgotten by the end of the

974
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:38,740
world does not mean that we do not  We are

975
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:42,070
dealing with attacks with threats

976
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:43,900
directly to all people since every

977
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:44,410
country,

978
01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:46,300
every system that is there on the internet,

979
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:49,150
because they have this type of risks and

980
01:22:49,150 --> 01:22:51,130
threats directly, and well, what

981
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:53,230
were the lessons learned from all

982
01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:55,660
of all the moral directly from this,

983
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:57,310
first, well, fishing  it is written with

984
01:22:57,310 --> 01:22:59,350
ph they did not realize they grab the entire

985
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:00,940
presentation it was wrongly written

986
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:03,310
directly now yes after

987
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:04,780
social networks are the new form of

988
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:06,850
mass fishing at the end of the day we

989
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:08,200
realize specifically who

990
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,120
email is nothing

991
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:13,540
correctly it also turned to a

992
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:16,030
new  level of atoms

993
01:23:16,030 --> 01:23:18,910
3 and 5 then phishing more me now

994
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:21,400
I am huge on these two vertices

995
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,910
true if you are uncles or sites or

996
01:23:24,910 --> 01:23:27,880
by teacher for my site it is synonymous with

997
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:30,310
yautepec please the game hits you that is to

998
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:33,070
say or I read that  site and that type

999
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:35,350
directly is not the only way but it

1000
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:37,510
is an improved one directly if

1001
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:39,130
we already know that this type of character

1002
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:42,580
v  truth does not change passwords does not like

1003
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:44,200
that they are changing passwords has

1004
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:49,690
everything to the default and if not directly

1005
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:52,030
the antivirus is no longer a solution

1006
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:53,620
we already realized specifically the

1007
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:56,320
antivirus system and even not directly see

1008
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,540
issues such as deere or monitored by

1009
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:00,790
means of earthquakes  they are important and

1010
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:02,920
relevant, right, the issue of if I want to and

1011
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,330
you are disconnected and it is no longer a

1012
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:06,220
security in Latin America we are

1013
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:08,110
still focused very minimally and

1014
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:10,120
our sanski region if nobody

1015
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,130
knows it nobody can attack me well it

1016
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:14,190
will live specifically for real if it

1017
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:15,430
had it

1018
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:17,950
is that  taboo that gender networks

1019
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:19,780
like nobody knows how they work as they

1020
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:23,170
are segmented only that nobody

1021
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:25,780
can enter with 50 firewalls nobody

1022
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:27,400
can close them but it was not

1023
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:30,520
lying at the end of the day everything

1024
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,130
can have security problems

1025
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:35,140
and finally well  on issues of

1026
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:37,030
massive denial of service attacks in

1027
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,400
our region or in very small countries,

1028
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,830
boxes are not the solution  n directly if

1029
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:43,330
at the end of the day you can put

1030
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:47,020
40,000 beaches, it is in the iese but in

1031
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:49,990
the client and they are not going to solve anything at the

1032
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:51,580
end of the day every day is in the cloud

1033
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:52,750
because until today we

1034
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:54,370
have a limitation at the country level

1035
01:24:54,370 --> 01:24:55,780
that we cannot open a jet we

1036
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:58,030
cannot say I have a

1037
01:24:58,030 --> 01:24:59,980
service action attack today I want to go 100 miles

1038
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:02,860
please sir ii-sp no no they cannot

1039
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:05,170
give it if that is our reality then

1040
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:06,940
therefore we have to look for solutions

1041
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:09,850
specifically that are more

1042
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:12,880
At the end of the day of all this comes the

1043
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,220
big question, which is quite true,

1044
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:18,610
everyone here knows it and it is the

1045
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:20,860
question, it is no longer that, it is not going to happen to

1046
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:25,150
me because I buy things and so on,

1047
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:27,160
but when it happens to me, it is  ready I'm going to

1048
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:29,020
be directly to have that

1049
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:31,540
reaction right and well that's a little bit

1050
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:34,260
the presentation

1051
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:38,580
is very interesting thank you very much

1052
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:42,570
camilo I wanted to know if anyone has

1053
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:48,530
any question in question for camilo

1054
01:25:48,530 --> 01:25:50,630
we have the

1055
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:52,200
[M  úsica]

1056
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:55,830
well the contact on the way if

1057
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:59,880
we wanted to contact him we can do it

1058
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:03,290
through the mail that we

1059
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,700
have we had a question if we are going to be there

1060
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:09,230
if we are going to have the presentations

1061
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:11,720
available

1062
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,970
and what I am going to tell you is that they are going to

1063
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:17,120
be available and the presenters

1064
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,400
are  Okay, they share it with us as

1065
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,250
well as the recording of the video, but

1066
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,770
that will happen in a few weeks because

1067
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:29,810
first we have to obtain the

1068
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:32,800
authorization of each

1069
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,490
of the presenters' speakers, so

1070
01:26:36,490 --> 01:26:38,900
I'm going to ask a question, well, I'm going to do a

thanks to him then I'll start it you

1100
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:32,269

yes please go ahead and well a few

1102
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:40,490
beers let's go to this presentation it's going

1103
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:42,710
to  try to do I am going to

1104
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:46,520
comment on the attacks that we have carried out in the

1105
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:50,720
region and we should have a way

1106
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,910
to detail the implications that it

1107
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:56,690
has in order to see this some

1108
01:28:56,690 --> 01:28:58,940
learning or conclusion regarding the

1109
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:05,480
security issue is this I am going to proceed

1110
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:07,219
with the presentation

1111
01:29:07,219 --> 01:29:10,280
Next I am going to list the set

1112
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,429
of cyberattacks that happened in Peru

1113
01:29:12,429 --> 01:29:15,199
both to people and companies as

1114
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:18,010
commented by the  previous colleagues,

1115
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:20,809
this type of type of different types is attacked a lot

1116
01:29:20,809 --> 01:29:24,050
during the year 2020 and

1117
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:26,449
the objective is to show not

1118
01:29:26,449 --> 01:29:28,820
only the people but also

1119
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:32,150
what concerns the government, the government of

1120
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:34,449
our countries, such as the institutions

1121
01:29:34,449 --> 01:29:38,139
of the armed forces in starting to

1122
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:40,389
develop  the technical capabilities

1123
01:29:40,389 --> 01:29:44,690
to be more protected the subject of the

1124
01:29:44,690 --> 01:29:46,760
security profile is of the professional

1125
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:49,159
who will be increasingly

1126
01:29:49,159 --> 01:29:51,409
needed in companies to make

1127
01:29:51,409 --> 01:29:53,420
ordinary people

1128
01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:56,030
aware that we use

1129
01:29:56,030 --> 01:30:00,479
technology more and more and also the subject of

1130
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:03,929
this let's say  from companies it

1131
01:30:03,929 --> 01:30:05,939
is sometimes difficult to make

1132
01:30:05,939 --> 01:30:08,159
aluminum managers of companies aware but with

1133
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:09,889
real examples I am going to try to explain

1134
01:30:09,889 --> 01:30:12,659
the importance of the city of

1135
01:30:12,659 --> 01:30:15,040
information and companies employ them

1136
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,610
[Music]

1137
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:18,710
a very important note that in the cases

1138
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:21,920
that I am going to  submit this has not tried

1139
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:22,969
to hide all personal information

1140
01:30:22,969 --> 01:30:25,310
are companies not to

1141
01:30:25,310 --> 01:30:27,409
enter into any conflict  ct with the

1142
01:30:27,409 --> 01:30:29,690
personal data protection law also

1143
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:32,270
with the issue of confidentiality

1144
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:35,270
in all cases I will present I am going to

1145
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:37,910
keep this we have some

1146
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:43,780
confidential information so as not to interrupt the day

1147
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:45,830
this is

1148
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:48,980
the first freedom that is this that will be a

1149
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:51,650
lot and the region is the issue  of run

1150
01:30:51,650 --> 01:30:53,520


1151
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,440
software run software is an attack

1152
01:30:55,440 --> 01:31:00,870
that began long before

1153
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:02,250
2017 in our region

1154
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:05,940
we are not talking about 2015 but it

1155
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:10,440
is a cyberattack that is useful and

1156
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:11,820
widely used for centuries

1157
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:14,040
criminals are not victims are

1158
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,670
companies  and government institutions,

1159
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:20,430
small and medium-sized companies,

1160
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:22,020
cybercriminals, the motivation of

1161
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:25,290
that money, they earn through

1162
01:31:25,290 --> 01:31:27,330
electronic money such as a disk, it is like a

1163
01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:29,620
wallet, no,

1164
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:31,720
the impact for companies is the fall

1165
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:34,630
of their services because sometimes it is the

1166
01:31:34,630 --> 01:31:36,250
run software to arrive  to encrypt all the

1167
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:39,370
internal servers of the company the

1168
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:41,290
frequency is all year round

1169
01:31:41,290 --> 01:31:44,739
there are this type of

1170
01:31:44,739 --> 01:31:47,019
cyberattacks and let's say  Personally, I put that

1171
01:31:47,019 --> 01:31:48,639
some may be massive and others

1172
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:51,880
directed, mostly I could say that they

1173
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:55,719
are of the massive type, that is,

1174
01:31:55,719 --> 01:31:57,429
they are constantly looking for a

1175
01:31:57,429 --> 01:32:00,880
vulnerability, that is, they are

1176
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,679
looking for a service published to the

1177
01:32:02,679 --> 01:32:05,400
internet by the company and that it has  it is

1178
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,719
outdated it does not have a patch there is

1179
01:32:07,719 --> 01:32:11,289
no management there but let's also say the

1180
01:32:11,289 --> 01:32:13,510
rise of war directed as they study

1181
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:17,050
the victim the potential that we say he

1182
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:20,159
may have for him to pay a ransom and

1183
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,480
much more dangerous because he has

1184
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,300
suddenly had months in the  company trying

1185
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:28,030
to let's say enter

1186
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:30,820
and moving laterally for all

1187
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:32,180
services

1188
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:35,750
more than 50 more than 50 project and 7 is

1189
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:39,159
born from this type of run software

1190
01:32:39,159 --> 01:32:40,869
and let's say a vector is through

1191
01:32:40,869 --> 01:32:42,519
email because you have many

1192
01:32:42,519 --> 01:32:44,769
doctors expressed with users the subject

1193
01:32:44,769 --> 01:32:48,459
technical definitions for this more

1194
01:32:48,459 --> 01:32:51,010
and more war a little more more this more

1195
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:52,869
complex not that it comes within the

1196
01:32:52,869 --> 01:32:55,269
together with a wor file  d as a file

1197
01:32:55,269 --> 01:32:59,800
points and as a link but also the

1198
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:02,199
second vector is the subject of

1199
01:33:02,199 --> 01:33:04,389
vulnerable servers if you publish

1200
01:33:04,389 --> 01:33:06,189
as I commented my previous qualities

1201
01:33:06,189 --> 01:33:09,159
this site should not be public a

1202
01:33:09,159 --> 01:33:11,499
web writer a terminal server from

1203
01:33:11,499 --> 01:33:13,590
berlin if chris you do not have

1204
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:15,459
outdated lingual then yes  attackers begin to

1205
01:33:15,459 --> 01:33:17,800
take advantage of these services

1206
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,570
because they are published to the entire internet

1207
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:22,150
and sometimes it is not necessary to publish them

1208
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:23,559
all to the entire internet because it is

1209
01:33:23,559 --> 01:33:25,959
necessary that your service is published

1210
01:33:25,959 --> 01:33:28,869
to europe joke to russia for

1211
01:33:28,869 --> 01:33:31,809
example it will not sell in general if

1212
01:33:31,809 --> 01:33:33,489
written clients or users are

1213
01:33:33,489 --> 01:33:35,829
in  peru to give the specific example no

1214
01:33:35,829 --> 01:33:38,229
so that can be done with

1215
01:33:38,229 --> 01:33:41,270
the current lighthouses

1216
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:44,150
and find by geolocation and for

1217
01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:46,070
example to control access is a

1218
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:48,950
basic control but we are going to go that it

1219
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:50,810
can be complemented another topic is

1220
01:33:50,810 --> 01:33:54,230
the black market no  there is a market in

1221
01:33:54,230 --> 01:33:56,390
which hacking that sell

1222
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:58,250
service credentials to bring down is respected  the

1223
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:00,860
terminal server from three dollars to

1224
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:04,100
70 dollars is not there we are going to see what

1225
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:07,820
we say in our experience one of

1226
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:09,770
the most frequent vectors of access is

1227
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:12,170
the rp in many of the cases that we have

1228
01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:14,510
seen rest of the work is that the company in

1229
01:34:14,510 --> 01:34:16,940
general has an rpp server  it connected the

1230
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:19,580
entire internet with very basic initials,

1231
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:22,100
so the attacker, as

1232
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:25,130
previous colleagues have commented, begins

1233
01:34:25,130 --> 01:34:26,480
to carry out a forceful attack together, he

1234
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:29,480
begins to enter the rdp but does not want to

1235
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,070
encrypt them, they are excited about bp, he wants to

1236
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:33,620
enter the network and encrypt all the

1237
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:35,480
database files  of data leaders

1238
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:38,270
of file servers and enter if

1239
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:40,130
I have more information here an

1240
01:34:40,130 --> 01:34:41,660
example for example of a bathroom that is a

1241
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:44,690
server of this let's say

1242
01:34:44,690 --> 01:34:45,500
the attackers' dogs

1243
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,420
the files have been encrypted in this

1244
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:48,350
way

1245
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:51,890
the mail the

1246
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:53,180
attackers' typical message  that all their encrypted files,

1247
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:56,420
for example, here they already leave us

1248
01:34:56,420 --> 01:34:57,740
their accounts and also their telegraaf account,

1249
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:59,420
the investigation seems very important

1250
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:01,190
ation and the coordination

1251
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:02,930
that have to be done with these

1252
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:04,430
service providers so that they

1253
01:35:04,430 --> 01:35:06,210
give us information

1254
01:35:06,210 --> 01:35:08,100
in the event that we had to

1255
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:10,680
enter it into the data all the

1256
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:12,870
files have been encrypted and present

1257
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:14,489
in good media is at this

1258
01:35:14,489 --> 01:35:15,930
email address and your

1259
01:35:15,930 --> 01:35:18,030
phone bill a second example is the

1260
01:35:18,030 --> 01:35:19,140
netbook but the document also

1261
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:21,270
accompany a colleague that ends up

1262
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:25,260
arriving but he does not interview in this

1263
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:28,530
way the files no and then he tells you

1264
01:35:28,530 --> 01:35:30,900
to contact then download the tor

1265
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:33,840
to hide his identity enter this

1266
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,900
address in the  rounding and then with

1267
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:39,019
this code you will have,

1268
01:35:39,019 --> 01:35:40,789
let's say, a communication with the

1269
01:35:40,789 --> 01:35:42,499
attackers to be able to negotiate and pay

1270
01:35:42,499 --> 01:35:44,899
they are looking for money

1271
01:35:44,899 --> 01:35:46,729
anyway that you make a payment that you

1272
01:35:46,729 --> 01:35:48,769
make by paying in all internet forums

1273
01:35:48,769 --> 01:35:50,419
and security specialists

1274
01:35:50,419 --> 01:35:53,329
recommend that you  nothing together

1275
01:35:53,329 --> 01:35:55,099
but we are going to see scenarios in

1276
01:35:55,099 --> 01:35:56,499
which

1277
01:35:56,499 --> 01:35:58,909
I have particularly seen for companies

1278
01:35:58,909 --> 01:36:00,229
that have had to  and pay because they did not

1279
01:36:00,229 --> 01:36:02,840
have a backup and they have had to

1280
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,670
be with the attacker and let's say the

1281
01:36:04,670 --> 01:36:07,999
attacker can make him and a Trojan

1282
01:36:07,999 --> 01:36:10,130
and the internal re and then as you find out

1283
01:36:10,130 --> 01:36:10,969


1284
01:36:10,969 --> 01:36:13,369
that they will continue to charge you according to

1285
01:36:13,369 --> 01:36:16,249
this account having a platform  in

1286
01:36:16,249 --> 01:36:17,959
which they can communicate like a

1287
01:36:17,959 --> 01:36:21,050
chat discarded in English this guy

1288
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:22,849
was talking to them but

1289
01:36:22,849 --> 01:36:24,489
normally they are taking advantage of

1290
01:36:24,489 --> 01:36:27,229
internal services services that are published and

1291
01:36:27,229 --> 01:36:28,849
moving laterally then also

1292
01:36:28,849 --> 01:36:30,709
for example that there is another example where to

1293
01:36:30,709 --> 01:36:32,900
encrypt the entire server unit

1294
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:35,389
and  you no longer have access when

1295
01:36:35,389 --> 01:36:37,190
the server proteas is towards this screen and

1296
01:36:37,190 --> 01:36:39,050
you have to connect with this soon

1297
01:36:39,050 --> 01:36:40,670
mail we will see many of the cases

1298
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:42,829
the server of soon mail is a

1299
01:36:42,829 --> 01:36:44,390
server of this

1300
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:46,340
[Music]

1301
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:49,519
is a service provider that uses a

1302
01:36:49,519 --> 01:36:51,619
lot  the attackers because they they

1303
01:36:51,619 --> 01:36:54,559
use it you cannot get to the

1304
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:58,099
identity and the original identity not because of

1305
01:36:58,099 --> 01:37:00,739
the regulatory issues of this own the

1306
01:37:00,739 --> 01:37:02,119
second well-known cyberattacks that

1307
01:37:02,119 --> 01:37:03,769
happens throughout the region for sure it is the issue

1308
01:37:03,769 --> 01:37:06,880
of phishing in the issue of phishing this

1309
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,650
you are going to see what is going to happen

1310
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:11,959
for the part of people, companies,

1311
01:37:11,959 --> 01:37:15,110
etc. the economic impact is

1312
01:37:15,110 --> 01:37:17,150
through the web, for example, banks that  they are

1313
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:21,019
very important this case of peru the

1314
01:37:21,019 --> 01:37:22,329
bank of the state of the bank of the nation

1315
01:37:22,329 --> 01:37:24,920
is a bank that uses it a lot to be

1316
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:28,150
able to do this what is it called

1317
01:37:28,150 --> 01:37:29,809
transactions

1318
01:37:29,809 --> 01:37:31,729
the bank very important private banks

1319
01:37:31,729 --> 01:37:33,679
also through text messages

1320
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:35,989
all the time this attack is  a

1321
01:37:35,989 --> 01:37:38,449
very old attack but it is an attack that is

1322
01:37:38,449 --> 01:37:41,360
efficient because even if they have

1323
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,579
money in agreement any question

1324
01:37:43,579 --> 01:37:46,159
we can do it for the group

1325
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:48,949
for him chávez wilson has also

1326
01:37:48,949 --> 01:37:51,380
used in the topics of the

1327
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:54,590
code topic and here come the

1328
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:56,179
application attacks  and publication with him last year

1329
01:37:56,179 --> 01:37:58,880
a company

1330
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:02,900
and let's say a private company that

1331
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:05,659
had an attack on an activist group and

1332
01:38:05,659 --> 01:38:08,030
here comes the activist groups co  mo

1333
01:38:08,030 --> 01:38:09,050
anonymous

1334
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:11,750
the group of clouds and points that are

1335
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:14,900
constantly watching the issues of people's

1336
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:17,409
rights they

1337
01:38:17,409 --> 01:38:20,120
responded to a set of

1338
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:22,310
actions that were carried out in this company

1339
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:24,940
that was a television channel and they

1340
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:27,920
had access and published it on the

1341
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:31,100
internet the  web service configurations

1342
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:32,750
that this television channel had

1343
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:34,760
are and 20 and tried to be cardboard and

1344
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:35,989
information that can be seen because the

1345
01:38:35,989 --> 01:38:38,480
class is studying it cannot be seen

1346
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:41,510
on the server that they are range are 900

1347
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:43,790
rd s the user the password and

1348
01:38:43,790 --> 01:38:46,000
port name and thus more detailed information

1349
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,440
of all the plain text they

1350
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:52,670
unfortunately shared this for

1351
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:54,890
example yesterday and then searched on the internet

1352
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:58,130
again and if I have published then here it is

1353
01:38:58,130 --> 01:39:00,960
important that all companies

1354
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:03,240
can agree because it will be

1355
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:04,970
very difficult  that you protect the entire environment

1356
01:39:04,970 --> 01:39:08,970
but having these procedures to, for

1357
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:10,710
example, hire you compatibility in

1358
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:12,960
this content is personal content

1359
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:14,430
is u  n content of the company he

1360
01:39:14,430 --> 01:39:15,840
would like everyone to download that everything

1361
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:20,600
that is public is from the services they

1362
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:23,150
had access to here with all the

1363
01:39:23,150 --> 01:39:27,020
sources so that according to this is a

1364
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:31,100
group of this activist from Peru and they

1365
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:33,590
had access they published it in

1366
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:36,910
July  2020 to the new ones but they also

1367
01:39:36,910 --> 01:39:39,050
obtained more than seven thousand

1368
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:44,330
user accounts this one from let's say the accounts

1369
01:39:44,330 --> 01:39:45,820
of people who had been

1370
01:39:45,820 --> 01:39:48,260
competing in games and so on in

1371
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:51,680
contests of this program also another

1372
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,270
television channel also had

1373
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:56,360
access yes and they were shown let's say and they

1374
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:58,600
had access  to the user the password

1375
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:02,030
etc. then they are much more

1376
01:40:02,030 --> 01:40:04,070
sophisticated attacks before entering a

1377
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:07,100
web application and then a

1378
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:09,950
database and let's say in this case the public one they

1379
01:40:09,950 --> 01:40:12,020
have been able to

1380
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:14,510
ask for a ransom from them they have not done it

1381
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:16,220
according to what I would like here  is to have

1382
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:18,260
activist groups that have more and more

1383
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:21,440
capacities and are more prepared

1384
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:24,500
according to what we have to do next to the

1385
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:25,850
private company and the  public sector to

1386
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:27,530
be more protected

1387
01:40:27,530 --> 01:40:29,000
[Music]

1388
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,430
another frequent cyberattack that is seen

1389
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:32,900
throughout the year is the

1390
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:34,700
central issue it exists in many of the

1391
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:37,790
companies sometimes they buy an IP central they

1392
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:40,610
connect it to the internet and it is

1393
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:43,850
connected to the entire internet without following

1394
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:47,180
them  levels of security because in the end

1395
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:49,340
the client or the company received a

1396
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:52,070
receipt like this called to countries that he

1397
01:40:52,070 --> 01:40:54,710
normally does not call

1398
01:40:54,710 --> 01:40:57,710
international traffic, he has to take

1399
01:40:57,710 --> 01:41:01,400
charge of the payment and start having

1400
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:05,750
a claim so that they can have this

1401
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:09,560
action item  for a matter of silence

1402
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:12,020
but normally this happens very frequently

1403
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:15,469
is that it is not good that no

1404
01:41:15,469 --> 01:41:17,659
service that connects to the internet you

1405
01:41:17,659 --> 01:41:20,630
publish it with passwords or by default

1406
01:41:20,630 --> 01:41:22,370
you have to make a garden you have to work

1407
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:26,020
on that part of agreement

1408
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:28,750
and then there is also the  part of your

1409
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:30,290
whatsapp request

1410
01:41:30,290 --> 01:41:31,700
[Music

1411
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:34,040
] I have placed this due to

1412
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:36,830
very interesting time pressure that will make

1413
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:39,640
people from both managing directors

1414
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:43,490
people due  companies and they

1415
01:41:43,490 --> 01:41:45,310
steal whatsapp according

1416
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:48,110
to fraud these monsters of

1417
01:41:48,110 --> 01:41:50,930
personal data and so on and through

1418
01:41:50,930 --> 01:41:52,630
social engineering

1419
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:56,699
a person buys a new line

1420
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:00,510
whatsapp

1421
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:02,220
and the pretty register with what

1422
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:04,200
the victim's bazaar at that time the

1423
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:06,150
victim  This message is going to arrive with

1424
01:42:06,150 --> 01:42:09,030
the code that they are installing

1425
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:11,220
a hub elsewhere, the component is

1426
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:12,600
suddenly not very inter-agency on

1427
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:15,420
these issues contact

1428
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:17,640
the victim by WhatsApp and please share that

1429
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,350
code that they have passed on to you or profession

1430
01:42:19,350 --> 01:42:22,950
code  xxx for one let's say they try to

1431
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:24,780
put a flower on it or to convince the

1432
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:27,560
person or the person as they are not very

1433
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:29,760
involved in these issues share that

1434
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,450
code and that attacker when installing their

1435
01:42:33,450 --> 01:42:35,280
whatsapp in the

1436
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,290
victim's line number or what the code is  and he already has

1437
01:42:37,290 --> 01:42:39,300
whatsapp he starts reading the whatsapp

1438
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:41,880
of the victim's extension

1439
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:45,739
this seems good to activate the

1440
01:42:45,739 --> 01:42:48,389
notification and it is never the case there is more

1441
01:42:48,389 --> 01:42:52,760
social vigilance than they are ac

1442
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:55,580
also ostumbrados the subject of activism as I

1443
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:58,670
commented at the time on the victims

1444
01:42:58,670 --> 01:42:59,960
because they are going to be all the issues of

1445
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:02,930
the private sector and we are going with those that the

1446
01:43:02,930 --> 01:43:04,280
people now that are for the subject of the

1447
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:06,920
youth the congress for our politicians

1448
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:09,430
the ministries on the subject  of the government

1449
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:13,190
and the activist groups we cannot

1450
01:43:13,190 --> 01:43:16,610
say look at them, they

1451
01:43:16,610 --> 01:43:18,200
are large groups, which is a group that

1452
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:20,480
has technical capabilities, they can

1453
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:24,080
make a denarius of service to a

1454
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:27,200
web service and they are everywhere,

1455
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:29,390
all the countries have in Peru in the

1456
01:43:29,390 --> 01:43:32,840
world like this anonymous spain etc and they are going

1457
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:35,090
to go against a target and they are going to take

1458
01:43:35,090 --> 01:43:36,830
all the bandwidth to make

1459
01:43:36,830 --> 01:43:39,830
your web service crash for example then the

1460
01:43:39,830 --> 01:43:41,210
impact then in the fall of

1461
01:43:41,210 --> 01:43:43,730
services and bpd and also for example

1462
01:43:43,730 --> 01:43:45,650
leaking of information  they can

1463
01:43:45,650 --> 01:43:47,540
get the data from that

1464
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:49,850
web service and then publish it on the

1465
01:43:49,850 --> 01:43:52,220
internet they did and perhaps I have the

1466
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:54,650
data for example it didn't happen I don't have the

1467
01:43:54,650 --> 01:43:56,780
data  of the congress of the republic and and

1468
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:58,949
miranda is here for you to see everything we

1469
01:43:58,949 --> 01:44:01,199
have obtained because the

1470
01:44:01,199 --> 01:44:04,019
protection side we have to work a lot on the

1471
01:44:04,019 --> 01:44:06,900
technical issue according to here is an example

1472
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:09,449
this happened in the year of four

1473
01:44:09,449 --> 01:44:11,969
servers in 2020

1474
01:44:11,969 --> 01:44:17,560
but in a cloud

1475
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:20,560
the  closer are a security provider that is

1476
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:22,480
also important is the aforementioned and

1477
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,850
below because this is how the establishment

1478
01:44:24,850 --> 01:44:27,190
has a very important critical mass

1479
01:44:27,190 --> 01:44:31,180
distributed then I have a

1480
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:33,010
knowing political issue we are in elections and

1481
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:34,450
probably we will also have problems

1482
01:44:34,450 --> 01:44:37,239
minutes days

1483
01:44:37,239 --> 01:44:41,590
also in November we had some here

1484
01:44:41,590 --> 01:44:44,460
political issues in peru and there was also a

1485
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:47,230
response it is a group of activists in

1486
01:44:47,230 --> 01:44:48,860
agreement

1487
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:53,150
and then there is the source and if you are

1488
01:44:53,150 --> 01:44:55,550
interested you will feel here after

1489
01:44:55,550 --> 01:44:57,890
finishing the presentation of neill and tim

1490
01:44:57,890 --> 01:45:02,450
manufacturer the victims are sent here

1491
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:04,340
well they were the organizations with

1492
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:06,470
these security teams  a

1493
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:09,050
security team is updated the authors

1494
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:11,980
I understand that let's say they asked for money

1495
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:15,440
until  at this point let's say let's say try

1496
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,800
to extort money from the company

1497
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:21,110
etc suddenly and the criminals had no

1498
01:45:21,110 --> 01:45:22,490
other way these

1499
01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:24,650
criminals who publicly published

1500
01:45:24,650 --> 01:45:28,160
more than 50 thousand vulnerable utm in

1501
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:30,170
November 2020 this

1502
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:32,690
vulnerability was from 2018 without opposing

1503
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:35,780
life a little old in agreement  of 2018

1504
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:38,210
, however, we are going to see here a

1505
01:45:38,210 --> 01:45:39,620
little detail because I want to enter here

1506
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:40,880
there is something that seems very

1507
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,010
interesting to all of us this

1508
01:45:43,010 --> 01:45:44,540
forum is becoming well known on the

1509
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:46,690
internet

1510
01:45:47,730 --> 01:45:51,070
facebook slip this year

1511
01:45:51,070 --> 01:45:54,460
the themes of a bank have been published  a

1512
01:45:54,460 --> 01:45:55,810
very important bank

1513
01:45:55,810 --> 01:46:01,690
let's say this neighbor in a way and on

1514
01:46:01,690 --> 01:46:03,190
November 24 of last year it was published

1515
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:06,130
that they had access to this to 50 thousand

1516
01:46:06,130 --> 01:46:07,240
teams

1517
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:10,000
let's say from this manufacturer

1518
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,650
the files were published by the people who had

1519
01:46:11,650 --> 01:46:13,840
access to the portal in a cold way and

1520
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:17,650
let's say free later  they downloaded and that

1521
01:46:17,650 --> 01:46:19,360
txt file that you can see here

1522
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:20,950
that file did you understand that this must not

1523
01:46:20,950 --> 01:46:23,140
be seen here  upload agree and

1524
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:24,550
let's say the pressures that this case had,

1525
01:46:24,550 --> 01:46:27,370
for example is upload

1526
01:46:27,370 --> 01:46:29,950
agree download it and I began to see what

1527
01:46:29,950 --> 01:46:32,680
this comes from India from these books from Asia

1528
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:35,670
Latin America from all of Latin America

1529
01:46:35,670 --> 01:46:37,950
this work is always very collaborative

1530
01:46:37,950 --> 01:46:41,460
this always has to  having

1531
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:44,800
good contacts I want to thank colleagues here

1532
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:48,309
in peru to andrés morales

1533
01:46:48,309 --> 01:46:50,199
robert as a rule that always after the

1534
01:46:50,199 --> 01:46:51,969
investigation system is also that

1535
01:46:51,969 --> 01:46:54,459
we began to investigate how many countries

1536
01:46:54,459 --> 01:46:56,800
how many times per month at that moment a

1537
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:59,289
man has a good time with 300 or 400

1538
01:46:59,289 --> 01:47:01,659
teams that were  vulnerable

1539
01:47:01,659 --> 01:47:04,719
okay Jeffrey Velázquez has also come it

1540
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:06,159
is clear that he is not dreaming of

1541
01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:09,550
sprays too and for example in this one in

1542
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:13,119
estelí you can see the vulnerable airship of

1543
01:47:13,119 --> 01:47:16,629
the user's computer the password in

1544
01:47:16,629 --> 01:47:18,999
plain text and the bp group in here we are

1545
01:47:18,999 --> 01:47:20,550
going to see it obviously me  I have removed

1546
01:47:20,550 --> 01:47:22,959
but I have removed the names in

1547
01:47:22,959 --> 01:47:23,979
agreement because the oppression of

1548
01:47:23,979 --> 01:47:25,869
conscience but let's say a person

1549
01:47:25,869 --> 01:47:27,869
who does not have  a lot of technical knowledge

1550
01:47:27,869 --> 01:47:31,239
is interesting is tve they put the lic relays on it I

1551
01:47:31,239 --> 01:47:32,319


1552
01:47:32,319 --> 01:47:34,209
was going to put it will see the ip address

1553
01:47:34,209 --> 01:47:36,849
from where the user connects that

1554
01:47:36,849 --> 01:47:39,489
is not so important so to speak but

1555
01:47:39,489 --> 01:47:41,260
having been the user and returning the

1556
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:43,780
password in plain text that is with  that

1557
01:47:43,780 --> 01:47:45,879
the user was farro and the password

1558
01:47:45,879 --> 01:47:49,349
abounded the 34 56

1559
01:47:49,420 --> 01:47:51,460
that point caught my attention

1560
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:54,219
because we would be that had access to the

1561
01:47:54,219 --> 01:47:56,739
data then I have obtained more data from

1562
01:47:56,739 --> 01:47:59,410
others from other countries see you we have already

1563
01:47:59,410 --> 01:48:01,929
tried to have there are different teams

1564
01:48:01,929 --> 01:48:04,199
that are outdated

1565
01:48:04,199 --> 01:48:07,619
well, I'm going to when we connect to as alba

1566
01:48:07,619 --> 01:48:10,289
we are 5 minutes away and I have two

1567
01:48:10,289 --> 01:48:12,420
interesting questions to ask you from the

1568
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:14,969
public from now on

1569
01:48:14,969 --> 01:48:17,340
the final conclusion is there is a lot of

1570
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:19,559
reflection with everything that

1571
01:48:19,559 --> 01:48:22,889
colleagues have commented and this colleague from Russia

1572
01:48:22,889 --> 01:48:25,530
who surely also has the look

1573
01:48:25,530 --> 01:48:28,709
from Europe to see why everyone always

1574
01:48:28,709 --> 01:48:31,019
blames and razor mine of rossi to the

1575
01:48:31,019 --> 01:48:33,749
other but at a minimum the importance

1576
01:48:33,749 --> 01:48:35,909
of the profile of the pro profile  professional

1577
01:48:35,909 --> 01:48:38,429
is always sent it is very important that

1578
01:48:38,429 --> 01:48:40,499
the profile of the professional has

1579
01:48:40,499 --> 01:48:43,229
knowledge of one of the two sides the

1580
01:48:43,229 --> 01:48:45,840
perspective of protection that has

1581
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,699
to allow a lot of protection but

1582
01:48:47,699 --> 01:48:50,280
also from the perspective of hacking

1583
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:52,409
because let's say there are many examples

1584
01:48:52,409 --> 01:48:55,610
that I cannot leave  confidential issues

1585
01:48:55,610 --> 01:48:57,900
and that sometimes they prepare a lot in

1586
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:00,809
protection but they don't know how to

1587
01:49:00,809 --> 01:49:03,480
defend themselves against an attack or there

1588
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:05,460
is also a lot of hacking but they don't know

1589
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:08,610
how to protect the idea is to have that part

1590
01:49:08,610 --> 01:49:11,429
that technical balance not to protect

1591
01:49:11,429 --> 01:49:13,800
I need to know how to attack  to attack

1592
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:16,770
him now as well as I am going to protect

1593
01:49:16,770 --> 01:49:19,079
agree to know about processes to see from

1594
01:49:19,079 --> 01:49:21,619
prisoners it has to be more or less orderly

1595
01:49:21,619 --> 01:49:24,599
this is very important that each person

1596
01:49:24,599 --> 01:49:26,480
who is in the group does not follow then

1597
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:28,409
we are the resurgence of

1598
01:49:28,409 --> 01:49:30,420
international gangs the bank that I told you

1599
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:31,889
count a month that attack has been this

1600
01:49:31,889 --> 01:49:34,230
year and a thousand 21 so a gang that has been

1601
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:36,059
adopted find a group of 100

1602
01:49:36,059 --> 01:49:38,410
next  public information

1603
01:49:38,410 --> 01:49:41,530
has entered, let's say, several to various

1604
01:49:41,530 --> 01:49:43,720
information from a bank and we are

1605
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:46,090
facing a band that has to

1606
01:49:46,090 --> 01:49:48,550
appear very high level techniques and it

1607
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:50,260
seemed necessary that our teams

1608
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:53,650
be technical and very good in

1609
01:49:53,650 --> 01:49:54,970
agreement and specialists in different

1610
01:49:54,970 --> 01:49:58,440
areas with malware  about whether countries

1611
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:00,520
need law enforcement,

1612
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:03,400
police and armed forces to continue

1613
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:04,990
specializing in going without crime

1614
01:50:04,990 --> 01:50:08,200
we just saw yesterday that this

1615
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:11,050
time line colonial by line company

1616
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:13,180
has suffered a software run and has

1617
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:14,950
apparently had to pay 25 million

1618
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:17,710
dollars and  They have been five days with

1619
01:50:17,710 --> 01:50:20,320
high gasoline in the US and this happens in my

1620
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:24,850
country, said Chad, I know that we are not so

1621
01:50:24,850 --> 01:50:26,350
prepared,

1622
01:50:26,350 --> 01:50:27,970
I know that we have personal efforts,

1623
01:50:27,970 --> 01:50:30,550
I know that capable people in management have

1624
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:32,410
a policy so that this is armed

1625
01:50:32,410 --> 01:50:34,870
a topic that I would like to

1626
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:38,140
share then there is the need to

1627
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:40,180
create in quilmes 300 of the spirit of

1628
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:41,620
protecting personal data

1629
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:44,470
that is what I say the following  If it is

1630
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:46,450
that this public security company

1631
01:50:46,450 --> 01:50:51,310
had a very strong and the third

1632
01:50:51,310 --> 01:50:54,520
exploit it was let's say easy who what

1633
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:56,440
international entity what has the

1634
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:59,860
local requires the manufacturer to promote

1635
01:50:59,860 --> 01:51:02,680
that all the security teams in

1636
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:04,990
the neighborhoods involved and the users

1637
01:51:04,990 --> 01:51:07,810
can  implement their systems

1638
01:51:07,810 --> 01:51:09,579


1639
01:51:09,579 --> 01:51:12,699
of repetition patches understand well but it is that

1640
01:51:12,699 --> 01:51:15,280
we are half empty so if there is a

1641
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,709
critical flaw the manufacturer saves himself

1642
01:51:17,709 --> 01:51:19,309


1643
01:51:19,309 --> 01:51:21,349
according to the governments should

1644
01:51:21,349 --> 01:51:23,269
encourage the software of

1645
01:51:23,269 --> 01:51:25,010
independent institutions that generate

1646
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:28,010
practical content finally according

1647
01:51:28,010 --> 01:51:31,369
to a final experience that  we

1648
01:51:31,369 --> 01:51:33,919
cannot extend it 100 percent of the

1649
01:51:33,919 --> 01:51:36,050
commercial manufacturers manufacturer

1650
01:51:36,050 --> 01:51:38,479
commercializing is a job but for

1651
01:51:38,479 --> 01:51:40,959
the time being they can tell you today beings

1652
01:51:40,959 --> 01:51:44,569
that there are surprises in the

1653
01:51:44,569 --> 01:51:46,819
technical capacities this part we do not

1654
01:51:46,819 --> 01:51:49,699
support it and they already left you there so

1655
01:51:49,699 --> 01:51:51,530
for that what we need  point one

1656
01:51:51,530 --> 01:51:53,659
that is seduction profession profile

1657
01:51:53,659 --> 01:51:56,119
s  security knows technically to be for a

1658
01:51:56,119 --> 01:51:58,039
defender it is always a child always

1659
01:51:58,039 --> 01:52:00,379
slowly do not depend only on the

1660
01:52:00,379 --> 01:52:05,839
manufacturer science support and then here

1661
01:52:05,839 --> 01:52:07,130
you go

1662
01:52:07,130 --> 01:52:11,030
I have run this to try to share

1663
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:14,270
everything I do not know if any questions

1664
01:52:14,270 --> 01:52:17,380
hello hello cesar thank you very much very

1665
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:22,100
interesting your presentation we have a

1666
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:24,050
question in the  question and

1667
01:52:24,050 --> 01:52:27,580
answer box and then in the chat what

1668
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:29,330


1669
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:32,270
would I tell you that we have a question from

1670
01:52:32,270 --> 01:52:34,670
home 2 shore in the question in the

1671
01:52:34,670 --> 01:52:36,560
question and answer chat and it says is it

1672
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:38,780
possible to prevent attacks with only web

1673
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:41,420
application firewall or do we need to

1674
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:43,130
compromise the internet as well

1675
01:52:43,130 --> 01:52:45,690
service providers

1676
01:52:45,690 --> 01:52:51,580
and that's enough that it's

1677
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:54,040
enough for edward that the web service

1678
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:56,739
is vulnerable for silver to

1679
01:52:56,739 --> 01:52:59,530
enter the network and start looking

1680
01:52:59,530 --> 01:53:02,380
for important files one will see a

1681
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:04,239
web database if you singlist

1682
01:53:04,239 --> 01:53:06,369
and then stone silver  no it is not

1683
01:53:06,369 --> 01:53:07,780
necessary that the internet problem is

1684
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:10,900
also vulnerable

1685
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:13,480
or it is enough that a service

1686
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:16,690
public is vulnerable for you to give

1687
01:53:16,690 --> 01:53:20,170
an entrance to the attacker of the truth

1688
01:53:20,170 --> 01:53:24,010
but that the defenses are in multiple

1689
01:53:24,010 --> 01:53:26,830
layers I also come with a web

1690
01:53:26,830 --> 01:53:29,080
applications console no no it would not be enough

1691
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:32,350
no answer jorge contreras bros

1692
01:53:32,350 --> 01:53:36,300
tell us in the chat bots in the

1693
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:38,440
sorry in the question and

1694
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:40,469
answer box thank you

1695
01:53:40,469 --> 01:53:43,570
césar excellent information would add

1696
01:53:43,570 --> 01:53:45,790
massive awareness campaigns and

1697
01:53:45,790 --> 01:53:48,280
that is what we were commenting on this

1698
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:50,500
by the way we have detected

1699
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:52,090
malicious peruvian hackers

1700
01:53:52,090 --> 01:53:55,090
in local houses in the central

1701
01:53:55,090 --> 01:53:56,740
america region layers that

1702
01:53:56,740 --> 01:53:59,170
can then be contacted  it is very

1703
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:01,300
important and graciela and let's share your

1704
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:03,160
information that thanks in this event

1705
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:04,990
we can share information and

1706
01:54:04,990 --> 01:54:08,969
experiences this

1707
01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:12,140
later I have two questions plus a

1708
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:16,670
question or if you had novick fe figueroa

1709
01:54:16,670 --> 01:54:19,700
who says good afternoon is it an example

1710
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:22,180
of combined attacks within the environment

1711
01:54:22,180 --> 01:54:25,940
I don't know if  if he was referring to a

1712
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:27,890
particular environment or some

1713
01:54:27,890 --> 01:54:30,290
combined attack I think  you had to examine, for

1714
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:31,930
example, the rented hacktivist groups,

1715
01:54:31,930 --> 01:54:33,950
thank you for the question from

1716
01:54:33,950 --> 01:54:35,750
the activists, sometimes it is necessary that

1717
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:38,510
from us and if we are going to rob congress

1718
01:54:38,510 --> 01:54:40,310
because it has misbehaved with these political issues,

1719
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:42,290
for example, we uploading

1720
01:54:42,290 --> 01:54:44,720
a burst is the congress but in that

1721
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:47,180
burst our guys that is why they are

1722
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:49,280
very concerned about responding efficiently

1723
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:52,490
but it is enough that one of the group of anonymous

1724
01:54:52,490 --> 01:54:55,760
or candy makes an implication attack

1725
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:58,250
on the database and obtain data this

1726
01:54:58,250 --> 01:55:00,050
thread goes here and then to publish

1727
01:55:00,050 --> 01:55:03,530
then the two can be  add up and it will

1728
01:55:03,530 --> 01:55:05,630
be more difficult for us for the

1729
01:55:05,630 --> 01:55:06,860
people who are protecting and

1730
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:08,570
dignifying this which always implies that

1731
01:55:08,570 --> 01:55:11,530
it is just a connection

1732
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:14,050
to be able to protect identify them

1733
01:55:14,050 --> 01:55:16,150
block it if both can be done and

1734
01:55:16,150 --> 01:55:17,829
a clear example is the groups of

1735
01:55:17,829 --> 01:55:22,329
activists ok and I have  another question that

1736
01:55:22,329 --> 01:55:25,599
would be like the last one after if it has

1737
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:29,050
more men and we'll go back to the last

1738
01:55:29,050 --> 01:55:33,219
presentation I have to record córdoba qu  and

1739
01:55:33,219 --> 01:55:35,170
I did it could establish some

1740
01:55:35,170 --> 01:55:36,909
correlation between the

1741
01:55:36,909 --> 01:55:41,969
ransomware attacks and the vulnerability seen in

1742
01:55:41,969 --> 01:55:47,369
2018 13 379

1743
01:55:48,270 --> 01:55:52,140
it seems to me that this vulnerability if it is

1744
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:55,140
2018

1745
01:55:55,140 --> 01:56:01,760
the security manufacturer this let's

1746
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:04,199
say is that as that future ability

1747
01:56:04,199 --> 01:56:07,710
allows you to see the vpn connections of

1748
01:56:07,710 --> 01:56:09,750
users like the username and

1749
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:12,420
password in plain text the attackers

1750
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:15,060
could not be using to connect

1751
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:17,520
to the security team and then log in

1752
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:20,400
remotely of course and then log in to the

1753
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:25,230
rule so this from my personal side

1754
01:56:25,230 --> 01:56:28,180
I have seen a couple of cases

1755
01:56:28,180 --> 01:56:30,280
in which for  For example, the private

1756
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:35,200
recorded value is

1757
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:38,140
that if they have a relationship, I cannot be a

1758
01:56:38,140 --> 01:56:40,630
mental patient, patiently, that if

1759
01:56:40,630 --> 01:56:43,870
there is a close relationship, the first ep is

1760
01:56:43,870 --> 01:56:46,270
recontra verified, many cases with

1761
01:56:46,270 --> 01:56:48,040
terminal server, that is, let's say

1762
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:51,040
vulnerable, this has been victimized,

1763
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:54,790
but on the subject of the

1764
01:56:54,790 --> 01:56:57,220
vulnerable equipment with this accounting I

1765
01:56:57,220 --> 01:57:00,310
could say that there have been about 34

1766
01:57:00,310 --> 01:57:02,470
cases in which there has been a relationship between  re

1767
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:05,050
security team vulnerable and rahm

1768
01:57:05,050 --> 01:57:07,290
sur

1769
01:57:08,239 --> 01:57:11,869
very well the last hour like this because if we

1770
01:57:11,869 --> 01:57:14,539
are not going to be able to go to the five-

1771
01:57:14,539 --> 01:57:17,420
minute break luis orihuela asked they

1772
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:19,429
stop them because of the experience today it is no longer

1773
01:57:19,429 --> 01:57:21,889
used in the p network however many

1774
01:57:21,889 --> 01:57:24,349
use it through  of bp.n clients and of

1775
01:57:24,349 --> 01:57:27,110
double authenticates the authentication factor

1776
01:57:27,110 --> 01:57:29,719
through

1777
01:57:29,719 --> 01:57:32,210
final clients these have had some

1778
01:57:32,210 --> 01:57:34,429
weakness in the well-known brands that you

1779
01:57:34,429 --> 01:57:39,530
know if I would look at this we were in

1780
01:57:39,530 --> 01:57:40,969
luís's question because I think I

1781
01:57:40,969 --> 01:57:42,769
take the opportunity to say that we should not

1782
01:57:42,769 --> 01:57:45,380
publish a  rpp service this

1783
01:57:45,380 --> 01:57:48,019
because it is a very frequent vector of use

1784
01:57:48,019 --> 01:57:50,539
and the idea is always to use the vpn client

1785
01:57:50,539 --> 01:57:53,900
of let's say the security team not out

1786
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:56,780
there and for example well it was pressed that urbi

1787
01:57:56,780 --> 01:57:58,519
well had a vulnerability it was last year

1788
01:57:58,519 --> 01:58:01,099
if I don't remember what  I recommended

1789
01:58:01,099 --> 01:58:03,050
patching

1790
01:58:03,050 --> 01:58:05,659
but in general that practice that

1791
01:58:05,659 --> 01:58:08,989
this Luis comments is fine and remote access

1792
01:58:08,989 --> 01:58:10,969
as political and civil should

1793
01:58:10,969 --> 01:58:13,380
always be through the vpn client security

1794
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:15,659
team  ad perimeter that the company has

1795
01:58:15,659 --> 01:58:17,750


1796
01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:23,430
and well then now if

1797
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:27,230
this law is made yes yes yes yes queue until well

1798
01:58:27,230 --> 01:58:29,850
thank you very much for your

1799
01:58:29,850 --> 01:58:32,610
very interesting presentation everything you shared

1800
01:58:32,610 --> 01:58:35,460
is very important that we know what is

1801
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:37,440
happening in our region beyond that

1802
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:40,610
is good  to share but also to be

1803
01:58:40,610 --> 01:58:43,020
precisely for what we are talking about because

1804
01:58:43,020 --> 01:58:45,300
as two organizations we

1805
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:47,160
have to prepare ourselves and we also have to

1806
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:49,500
prepare our target community

1807
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:52,290
for users and also this power to

1808
01:58:52,290 --> 01:58:54,780
generate or seek

1809
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:57,570
collaboration spaces between between between the region

1810
01:58:57,570 --> 01:59:01,219
for good to be able to

1811
01:59:01,580 --> 01:59:04,230
contribute our grain of  arena for

1812
01:59:04,230 --> 01:59:06,239
the internet to be open, stable and secure

1813
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:09,120
and now we are going to go to a 'break'

1814
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:11,730
we have a little less than 10 minutes

1815
01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:15,230
of break we return and 5

1816
01:59:15,230 --> 01:59:20,060
are 1905 etc that we return sharply and

1817
01:59:20,060 --> 01:59:23,060
we are going to go with the next presentation and

1818
01:59:23,060 --> 01:59:24,920
the  last day today that will be in

1819
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:27,860

1822
01:59:45,730 --> 01:59:49,900
is exercised you are not welcome now you have to

1823
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:55,239
disconnect your video and your microphone and

1824
01:59:55,239 --> 01:59:56,710
stop sharing the screen these

1825
01:59:56,710 --> 02:00:00,239
three things thank you

1826

02:05:22,130 --> 02:05:25,040
is in charge, his position is the floor of the

1835
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:27,800
Colombian national police, so thank you very

1836
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:30,670
much, and whenever you want, you can

1837
02:05:30,670 --> 02:05:35,080
share the screen, he asked you to

1838
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:39,770
ask any questions you have and  do them in

1839
02:05:39,770 --> 02:05:41,780
the question and answer

1840
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:43,940
box because in the chat box you

1841
02:05:43,940 --> 02:05:45,590
can get lost

1842
02:05:45,590 --> 02:05:48,860
thanks and go ahead when I'm going to

1843
02:05:48,860 --> 02:05:51,560
turn off my video or microphone so as not

1844
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:53,900
to interfere and that you've seen

1845
02:05:53,900 --> 02:05:58,099
moments before and it's good very good

1846
02:05:58,099 --> 02:05:59,770
afternoon thank you very much for  the invitation

1847
02:05:59,770 --> 02:06:01,760
as I said, thank you today the

1848
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:04,639
current captain jon guevara became the

1849
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:07,040
national police for us it is a

1850
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:08,540
pleasure to be able to share  Some of the

1851
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:10,190
experience that we have had here for a long time,

1852
02:06:10,190 --> 02:06:12,199
more or less than 12 years, on the subject of

1853
02:06:12,199 --> 02:06:14,330
information security and the

1854
02:06:14,330 --> 02:06:15,560
conclusions that we have already reached

1855
02:06:15,560 --> 02:06:17,719
after this time,

1856
02:06:17,719 --> 02:06:21,760
good for those who do not know where the national police is, the

1857
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:23,690
national police of

1858
02:06:23,690 --> 02:06:24,650
Colombia

1859
02:06:24,650 --> 02:06:26,929
we are 180,000 people more or

1860
02:06:26,929 --> 02:06:29,900
less and we have to

1861
02:06:29,900 --> 02:06:31,969
cover all the incidents and

1862
02:06:31,969 --> 02:06:32,900
everything that can happen on our

1863
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:34,909
technological platform at a national level and I want to

1864
02:06:34,909 --> 02:06:36,320
start this talk by telling you this,

1865
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:38,389
and basically dealing with incidents

1866
02:06:38,389 --> 02:06:39,949
on a platform as big as the  of

1867
02:06:39,949 --> 02:06:42,769
us is basically to measure them it is very

1868
02:06:42,769 --> 02:06:45,710
very difficult it is almost impossible and I

1869
02:06:45,710 --> 02:06:48,139
put the image of erasto tenés because

1870
02:06:48,139 --> 02:06:51,139
this guy at this time managed to know more

1871
02:06:51,139 --> 02:06:52,489
or less what the diameter of the

1872
02:06:52,489 --> 02:06:55,760
earth was and more or less by his ingenuity

1873
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:57,949
he managed to discover that  the round print run

1874
02:06:57,949 --> 02:06:59,800
and more or less like that happened to

1875
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:02,719
us 11 years ago when we started with the

1876
02:07:02,719 --> 02:07:04,389
incident response team here

1877
02:07:04,389 --> 02:07:07,099
normally one in  at the moment there are

1878
02:07:07,099 --> 02:07:10,639
tools people but behind

1879
02:07:10,639 --> 02:07:12,199
this there has to be a whole strategy

1880
02:07:12,199 --> 02:07:14,479
for one at some point to begin to

1881
02:07:14,479 --> 02:07:16,369
know what is happening because in this

1882
02:07:16,369 --> 02:07:18,619
matter as we all know one would believe

1883
02:07:18,619 --> 02:07:19,849
that a tool gives the

1884
02:07:19,849 --> 02:07:21,229
absolute truth but to a tool

1885
02:07:21,229 --> 02:07:22,999
many things go wrong and one would think that it

1886
02:07:22,999 --> 02:07:24,230
is fine but

1887
02:07:24,230 --> 02:07:25,970
the instructions are there all the time

1888
02:07:25,970 --> 02:07:29,600
from any attack vector who

1889
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:31,340
are we and why do we think it

1890
02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:33,590
is very complicated and it has seemed to us

1891
02:07:33,590 --> 02:07:35,420
for the last 10 years

1892
02:07:35,420 --> 02:07:37,430
and 11 years we are complying with is  that

1893
02:07:37,430 --> 02:07:39,230
our our our territory

1894
02:07:39,230 --> 02:07:40,700
our amount of assets that we have

1895
02:07:40,700 --> 02:07:42,080
to protect are these that you see

1896
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:45,890
there are 84 thousand computers 25 thousand

1897
02:07:45,890 --> 02:07:47,810
mobile devices in some

1898
02:07:47,810 --> 02:07:50,330
information systems some public websites and

1899
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:51,980
what you see is what

1900
02:07:51,980 --> 02:07:54,410
we really have to protect and  the raison d'être

1901
02:07:54,410 --> 02:07:55,640
of an incident response team

1902
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:59,180
is that we are 180,000 users 180,000

1903
02:07:59,180 --> 02:08:00,620
users with the capabilities that u  You

1904
02:08:00,620 --> 02:08:02,360
see there distributed throughout

1905
02:08:02,360 --> 02:08:05,030
Colombia, all entering and exiting through

1906
02:08:05,030 --> 02:08:07,370
a single point, so imagine

1907
02:08:07,370 --> 02:08:08,989
everything that can happen to one or

1908
02:08:08,989 --> 02:08:11,390
everything that one could stop seeing at

1909
02:08:11,390 --> 02:08:12,530
some point those two points that

1910
02:08:12,530 --> 02:08:14,390
you see in  a red and orange color

1911
02:08:14,390 --> 02:08:16,730
were punctual effects on the

1912
02:08:16,730 --> 02:08:18,560
data channel in those places when when

1913
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:20,860
we were building these is light

1914
02:08:20,860 --> 02:08:23,000
that came to us at the

1915
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,580
time let's say this is a moon as a

1916
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:27,800
quick context to really tell you about

1917
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:29,570
the experience that leads us to us

1918
02:08:29,570 --> 02:08:31,430
that today the way we dealt with

1919
02:08:31,430 --> 02:08:33,230
incidents was basically like this and I think

1920
02:08:33,230 --> 02:08:35,350
we have all been through that moment

1921
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:37,370
we run into a failure an

1922
02:08:37,370 --> 02:08:39,110
unavailability some tool

1923
02:08:39,110 --> 02:08:41,090
can tell us something a piece of news a

1924
02:08:41,090 --> 02:08:43,610
newspaper a tweet now with the theme of

1925
02:08:43,610 --> 02:08:45,860
activism many alarms are learned

1926
02:08:45,860 --> 02:08:48,110
emails go out  emails come

1927
02:08:48,110 --> 02:08:50,300
out excel files come out possible

1928
02:08:50,300 --> 02:08:52,370
database law and one starts to go back and

1929
02:08:52,370 --> 02:08:53,840
says listen to this c  hen it came out you could see it

1930
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:55,790
had to be seen it came out at some point it had

1931
02:08:55,790 --> 02:08:56,960
to be seen to come out at the moment but

1932
02:08:56,960 --> 02:08:59,210
because I couldn't see it almost always we

1933
02:08:59,210 --> 02:09:01,190
responded to the word that you

1934
02:09:01,190 --> 02:09:03,440
see in the center and they are failures and I think

1935
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:05,270
that was not the reason for being because  if one

1936
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:07,880
has here in the national police we

1937
02:09:07,880 --> 02:09:10,370
implement a security management system for

1938
02:09:10,370 --> 02:09:12,219
the information we implement

1939
02:09:12,219 --> 02:09:14,510
a response team, next it will be

1940
02:09:14,510 --> 02:09:16,250
to avoid failures, that is,

1941
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:17,989
if the failure is really over, then all that preventive part,

1942
02:09:17,989 --> 02:09:21,110
which for me is 90 80 percent

1943
02:09:21,110 --> 02:09:22,070
hundred of a computer incident response team

1944
02:09:22,070 --> 02:09:24,200
failed so

1945
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:26,239
at that moment we did as a parent

1946
02:09:26,239 --> 02:09:28,070
said hey let's start

1947
02:09:28,070 --> 02:09:30,620
doing something and we created the

1948
02:09:30,620 --> 02:09:32,390
response team in do you feel that it allows us to

1949
02:09:32,390 --> 02:09:34,160
have this behavior that

1950
02:09:34,160 --> 02:09:36,860
we say here if that's where I'm going  to

1951
02:09:36,860 --> 02:09:39,110
focus here on this in this

1952
02:09:39,110 --> 02:09:41,810
slide in three scenarios a scenario

1953
02:09:41,810 --> 02:09:44,390
that begins in 2011 in this 2011 is

1954
02:09:44,390 --> 02:09:46,489
when a response team is formally created

1955
02:09:46,489 --> 02:09:48,050
is in the following here in the

1956
02:09:48,050 --> 02:09:49,790
national police of Colombia in which

1957
02:09:49,790 --> 02:09:51,830
the people of your moment say hey, it is

1958
02:09:51,830 --> 02:09:53,840
necessary to have incident management,

1959
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:56,450
not to deal with incidents,

1960
02:09:56,450 --> 02:09:58,430
let's say reactively, otherwise we have

1961
02:09:58,430 --> 02:10:00,260
to do the whole layer and for us to

1962
02:10:00,260 --> 02:10:03,039
manage is to get down from  60 incidents

1963
02:10:03,039 --> 02:10:05,199
to the values let's say that we could lower

1964
02:10:05,199 --> 02:10:09,099
at the time from 2011 to 2013 norma

1965
02:10:09,099 --> 02:10:10,689
ive issues were implemented proce

1966
02:10:10,689 --> 02:10:13,599
ses good practices implementation of qu

1967
02:10:13,599 --> 02:10:15,429
lity management systems to docum

1968
02:10:15,429 --> 02:10:19,749
nt the bank of let's say as the d

1969
02:10:19,749 --> 02:10:21,849
tabase of knowledge of the incid

1970
02:10:21,849 --> 02:10:24,329
nts we  it helped a lot first to

1971
02:10:24,329 --> 02:10:26,379
learn how to care for them to learn how to

1972
02:10:26,379 --> 02:10:28,269
document because at the time

1973
02:10:28,269 --> 02:10:29,649
we didn't even know how to document it, then

1974
02:10:29,649 --> 02:10:31,089
an incident that was repeated all the

1975
02:10:31,089 --> 02:10:33,280
time because we couldn't find the

1976
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:34,119
lesson learned

1977
02:10:34,119 --> 02:10:36,669
we had an incident with a failure due to

1978
02:10:36,669 --> 02:10:38,979
an intrusion or an infection with

1979
02:10:38,979 --> 02:10:41,079
malware in its time and the same thing always happened to us

1980
02:10:41,079 --> 02:10:42,489
because we didn't take the

1981
02:10:42,489 --> 02:10:44,049
trouble to  define some good lessons

1982
02:10:44,049 --> 02:10:46,719
learned that is the first phase that

1983
02:10:46,719 --> 02:10:48,849
we say although it had technical support it

1984
02:10:48,849 --> 02:10:51,489
was more a quality issue it allowed us to

1985
02:10:51,489 --> 02:10:53,859
reduce incidents by 50%, that is,

1986
02:10:53,859 --> 02:10:55,329
the incidents that we saw at the time

1987
02:10:55,329 --> 02:10:57,609
and it is as if we say what you want what

1988
02:10:57,609 --> 02:10:59,139
I want to put together at once as a

1989
02:10:59,139 --> 02:11:01,329
conclusion what we saw, I

1990
02:11:01,329 --> 02:11:03,549
think there were much more than 60, I think there

1991
02:11:03,549 --> 02:11:06,219
were 200, 300 incidents, only 60 were

1992
02:11:06,219 --> 02:11:08,530
the ones that at some point either the

1993
02:11:08,530 --> 02:11:09,670
processes

1994
02:11:09,670 --> 02:11:11,739
of the institution informed them or the

1995
02:11:11,739 --> 02:11:13,330
people did not.  they were informed or that they were

1996
02:11:13,330 --> 02:11:15,100
made public through any

1997
02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:16,780
platform of its time

1998
02:11:16,780 --> 02:11:19,600
in that 2013 it begins with a time

1999
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:21,190
of say five years that the second

2000
02:11:21,190 --> 02:11:22,960
phase in which tools are already implemented

2001
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:25,000
or we already have this issue

2002
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:26,739
cannot be done manually or  be one

2003
02:11:26,739 --> 02:11:28,960
could in some case we did that

2004
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:30,580
analysis one in some case could do

2005
02:11:30,580 --> 02:11:33,699
that that attention if you had a a network

2006
02:11:33,699 --> 02:11:35,980
plan let's say small doing without your

2007
02:11:35,980 --> 02:11:38,679
teams but when you look at the  first

2008
02:11:38,679 --> 02:11:40,150
slide the second a like showed them

2009
02:11:40,150 --> 02:11:42,280
that there are more or less 100,000 active with

2010
02:11:42,280 --> 02:11:44,469
180 thousand users who did not have a

2011
02:11:44,469 --> 02:11:46,660
culture that it was fishing that it

2012
02:11:46,660 --> 02:11:48,310
was malware that it was spam that

2013
02:11:48,310 --> 02:11:50,590
social engineering well at that time

2014
02:11:50,590 --> 02:11:52,449
that was  It turns into complete chaos if I don't

2015
02:11:52,449 --> 02:11:53,710
have a tool that allows me to

2016
02:11:53,710 --> 02:11:56,590
anticipate these behaviors today,

2017
02:11:56,590 --> 02:11:57,730
well, at the time they weren't as

2018
02:11:57,730 --> 02:11:59,800
anticipatory, they were more reactive, but

2019
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:01,570
let's say over the years they

2020
02:12:01,570 --> 02:12:03,910
evolved that theme, let's say if

2021
02:12:03,910 --> 02:12:05,980
you see the line  The red line is the

2022
02:12:05,980 --> 02:12:08,290
evolution, let's say the incidents, more or

2023
02:12:08,290 --> 02:12:10,780
less, we decreased in your time, we

2024
02:12:10,780 --> 02:12:14,530
decreased by 70 and some percent

2025
02:12:14,530 --> 02:12:16,510
because you would not have seen this 72

2026
02:12:16,510 --> 02:12:19,330
percent from 2013 to 2018 and if

2027
02:12:19,330 --> 02:12:21,370
you see the yellow line and you

2028
02:12:21,370 --> 02:12:24,100
can see  on the screen was the

2029
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:25,660
perimeter detection tools that

2030
02:12:25,660 --> 02:12:27,580
we had, this led

2031
02:12:27,580 --> 02:12:29,679
us to a conclusion, at the

2032
02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:32,530
time, in the first phase, we had no

2033
02:12:32,530 --> 02:12:34,179
tools.  Many of us thought we

2034
02:12:34,179 --> 02:12:35,739
had 60, I imagine there were many

2035
02:12:35,739 --> 02:12:38,020
more because the attacks over

2036
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:39,969
time were growing, effectively

2037
02:12:39,969 --> 02:12:41,770
the incidents were decreasing but

2038
02:12:41,770 --> 02:12:43,960
there we still weren't seeing everything,

2039
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:46,989
that is, that did help us reactive

2040
02:12:46,989 --> 02:12:48,550
controls preventive controls let's say the

2041
02:12:48,550 --> 02:12:50,050
controls that any institution

2042
02:12:50,050 --> 02:12:52,510
can  have tools to

2043
02:12:52,510 --> 02:12:54,790
mitigate denial of service attacks

2044
02:12:54,790 --> 02:12:58,030
waffe issues behavior analysis issues

2045
02:12:58,030 --> 02:13:00,130
sandbox well all the

2046
02:13:00,130 --> 02:13:01,480
toys that can be

2047
02:13:01,480 --> 02:13:03,429
obtained today in information security and

2048
02:13:03,429 --> 02:13:04,840
that after you know how to locate them

2049
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:06,489
on the network makes an effective medication

2050
02:13:06,489 --> 02:13:09,400
let's say  That is another topic that comes

2051
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:11,350
into discussion because sometimes if

2052
02:13:11,350 --> 02:13:13,900
you have some unboxes, it could prevent it from

2053
02:13:13,900 --> 02:13:15,280
getting infected, yes, but it depends where they

2054
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:17,560
place it and it depends on whether or not your unboxes see

2055
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:18,880
encrypted traffic

2056
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:20,830
of that style that one understands along the way.

2057
02:13:20,830 --> 02:13:23,679
effectively we saw that the

2058
02:13:23,679 --> 02:13:25,929
tools did have a value and that

2059
02:13:25,929 --> 02:13:27,639
value was what  And

2060
02:13:27,639 --> 02:13:29,170
the attacks began to grow and mitigate and

2061
02:13:29,170 --> 02:13:30,310
the incidents began to decrease.

2062
02:13:30,310 --> 02:13:32,110
That was, let's say, our second stage,

2063
02:13:32,110 --> 02:13:35,139
which was around 2018, and our third

2064
02:13:35,139 --> 02:13:36,280
stage, which is, let's say, the one we are

2065
02:13:36,280 --> 02:13:38,110
experiencing right now, the stage

2066
02:13:38,110 --> 02:13:39,909
in which we already implemented these indicators.

2067
02:13:39,909 --> 02:13:41,920
They are the management indicators that

2068
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:43,480
allow us to move, we implement

2069
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:46,270
tools, let's say, and systems that

2070
02:13:46,270 --> 02:13:48,190
today the industry already has a lot of,

2071
02:13:48,190 --> 02:13:50,199
and they are artificial intelligence issues and

2072
02:13:50,199 --> 02:13:52,630
issues of the Chilean sea. If you see in the

2073
02:13:52,630 --> 02:13:54,400
third phase, the attacks have

2074
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:56,290
increased exponentially, well,

2075
02:13:56,290 --> 02:13:58,120
we  We are the national police of

2076
02:13:58,120 --> 02:14:00,340
Colombia. You will believe that we

2077
02:14:00,340 --> 02:14:02,440
will think that the police are very

2078
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:05,050
susceptible to the mood of the

2079
02:14:05,050 --> 02:14:07,150
decisions of a state, so if at

2080
02:14:07,150 --> 02:14:08,739
any time a state does not make a

2081
02:14:08,739 --> 02:14:10,840
decision that is popular, then the

2082
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:12,610
repercussion comes from among the entity

2083
02:14:12,610 --> 02:14:13,929
of the  state and we are not the

2084
02:14:13,929 --> 02:14:16,870
exception since 2008 they started this

2085
02:14:16,870 --> 02:14:19,120
issue of movements of m  archas

2086
02:14:19,120 --> 02:14:21,400
worldwide colombian has been the section and

2087
02:14:21,400 --> 02:14:23,170
began to grow exponentially

2088
02:14:23,170 --> 02:14:24,429
what you see in the yellow line

2089
02:14:24,429 --> 02:14:25,170
are ctc

2090
02:14:25,170 --> 02:14:26,850
typically tape

2091
02:14:26,850 --> 02:14:29,370
layer 7 denial of service attacks that detect the

2092
02:14:29,370 --> 02:14:31,860
application firewall or the ips and the

2093
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:33,719
other line  What you see is the detection

2094
02:14:33,719 --> 02:14:35,550
of malware, let's say an indicator that

2095
02:14:35,550 --> 02:14:37,469
we began to measure, we

2096
02:14:37,469 --> 02:14:39,570
had always had antivirus, we have always

2097
02:14:39,570 --> 02:14:41,100
had antivirus installed from our

2098
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:43,140
institution, but we had never made

2099
02:14:43,140 --> 02:14:46,260
an indicator of how productive

2100
02:14:46,260 --> 02:14:49,320
that antivirus was, so let's say

2101
02:14:49,320 --> 02:14:50,880
that sometimes part  of the fact that the

2102
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:52,710
antivirus is there for that and the antivirus

2103
02:14:52,710 --> 02:14:55,050
should detect but when

2104
02:14:55,050 --> 02:14:56,610
these tools appear that audit the

2105
02:14:56,610 --> 02:14:59,520
antivirus as both and both

2106
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:01,410
because any of those that exist in the

2107
02:15:01,410 --> 02:15:03,449
market allowed us to show that

2108
02:15:03,449 --> 02:15:05,340
effectively if the antivirus

2109
02:15:05,340 --> 02:15:07,260
detected or did not detect what  that

2110
02:15:07,260 --> 02:15:08,760
the computer was infected because one lives

2111
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:10,949
with a false tranquility and so I

2112
02:15:10,949 --> 02:15:12,630
I have we have a hundred thousand computers

2113
02:15:12,630 --> 02:15:14,880
and I have a hundred thousand antivirus nodes in

2114
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:16,679
theory my computer should be should

2115
02:15:16,679 --> 02:15:18,540
be free but it's not like that when

2116
02:15:18,540 --> 02:15:20,370
you start to compare that with what

2117
02:15:20,370 --> 02:15:22,679
a perimeter sandbox sees you start to see

2118
02:15:22,679 --> 02:15:24,239
a lot of things

2119
02:15:24,239 --> 02:15:25,920
but the  conclusion of this graph

2120
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:28,230
what I want to tell you is that from 2010 18

2121
02:15:28,230 --> 02:15:30,749
to 2020 the materialized

2122
02:15:30,749 --> 02:15:33,749
incidents stabilized, that is, the incidents did not

2123
02:15:33,749 --> 02:15:36,090
begin to decrease, they did not begin to

2124
02:15:36,090 --> 02:15:37,590
decrease, but rather stabilized at the

2125
02:15:37,590 --> 02:15:39,599
time and that is how it is, let's say or since we are

2126
02:15:39,599 --> 02:15:42,360
missing because  yes yes I already have let's say

2127
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:44,610
a lot of tools if I already have

2128
02:15:44,610 --> 02:15:46,469
a mature system more or less than 10 years old

2129
02:15:46,469 --> 02:15:48,239
because the incidents stabilize

2130
02:15:48,239 --> 02:15:52,110
for me instead of instead of starting to improve and

2131
02:15:52,110 --> 02:15:54,119
start to let's say get to do and here it

2132
02:15:54,119 --> 02:15:57,269
comes let's say  a zoom to the last part

2133
02:15:57,269 --> 02:15:59,639
here it is a model of the last thing

2134
02:15:59,639 --> 02:16:00,840
that I am showing you these are the

2135
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:02,940
last years and we make a measurement by

2136
02:16:02,940 --> 02:16:04,769
quarter by semester of what is

2137
02:16:04,769 --> 02:16:07,499
happening  in 2018 here if you see the

2138
02:16:07,499 --> 02:16:10,349
detection of malware, let's say the

2139
02:16:10,349 --> 02:16:12,269
detection increases or is already beginning to

2140
02:16:12,269 --> 02:16:14,219
decrease the number of infections that

2141
02:16:14,219 --> 02:16:15,719
our computers had the

2142
02:16:15,719 --> 02:16:17,670
yellow line are infections of our

2143
02:16:17,670 --> 02:16:20,309
computers or they are beginning to drop let's say in

2144
02:16:20,309 --> 02:16:22,710
an accelerated way important us

2145
02:16:22,710 --> 02:16:25,079
today in  day we have more or

2146
02:16:25,079 --> 02:16:27,000
less between 40 per semester

2147
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,040
and much less we have about 30

2148
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:31,380
infected computers from all our reality that

2149
02:16:31,380 --> 02:16:32,638
at the time when the tools began they

2150
02:16:32,638 --> 02:16:33,660
are in the order of

2151
02:16:33,660 --> 02:16:35,790
120 and I would think that more because

2152
02:16:35,790 --> 02:16:38,490
we did not ask for that issue the detection of

2153
02:16:38,490 --> 02:16:39,900
Perimeter attacks begin to grow and as

2154
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:42,000
you see it, the incidents continue, the

2155
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,340
incidents continue to occur,

2156
02:16:43,340 --> 02:16:47,340
we implement tools such as

2157
02:16:47,340 --> 02:16:48,179
artificial intelligence,

2158
02:16:48,179 --> 02:16:51,150
that is to greatly improve the delegation,

2159
02:16:51,150 --> 02:16:52,620
the mitigation, I would believe that if we had not put ourselves in,

2160
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:54,540
the

2161
02:16:54,540 --> 02:16:56,490
incidents would not have had a line,

2162
02:16:56,490 --> 02:16:58,709
let's say  behavioral statics if they

2163
02:16:58,709 --> 02:16:59,900
hadn't started  or to grow

2164
02:16:59,900 --> 02:17:02,070
additionally we put technologies

2165
02:17:02,070 --> 02:17:03,450
both types and web to what are we

2166
02:17:03,450 --> 02:17:05,190
say today moves the issue

2167
02:17:05,190 --> 02:17:07,558
of user behavior and for that

2168
02:17:07,558 --> 02:17:09,480
I want to take them to you and I think that at some

2169
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:10,920
point something is missing here

2170
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:13,019
some of us are having something we are not

2171
02:17:13,019 --> 02:17:15,530
having  into account and that since we

2172
02:17:15,530 --> 02:17:17,670
return that since we are not taking into

2173
02:17:17,670 --> 02:17:20,218
account in this extra topic that one with

2174
02:17:20,218 --> 02:17:22,468
only technical capabilities could

2175
02:17:22,468 --> 02:17:23,968
guarantee that an institution is

2176
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:26,549
completely completely safe

2177
02:17:26,549 --> 02:17:28,709
and well this topic and in this topic that

2178
02:17:28,709 --> 02:17:30,689
we say that it is like a parenthesis  that

2179
02:17:30,689 --> 02:17:32,910
I want to open there is always a serious one there is

2180
02:17:32,910 --> 02:17:34,740
always there there is always a

2181
02:17:34,740 --> 02:17:36,179
vulnerability that we do not know about we

2182
02:17:36,179 --> 02:17:37,590
do not know how many there are because there are

2183
02:17:37,590 --> 02:17:39,510
many that are not public for

2184
02:17:39,510 --> 02:17:42,870
some reason because someone does

2185
02:17:42,870 --> 02:17:44,280
not want to say them because it is an

2186
02:17:44,280 --> 02:17:47,040
easy way to enter  He placed a simile there

2187
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:50,760
with the theme of Kobe 19, how long did it take them to

2188
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:53,728
find out that this man

2189
02:17:53,728 --> 02:17:55,439
was always patient zero?  There is going to be

2190
02:17:55,439 --> 02:17:57,718
a zero patient and that period of time we do

2191
02:17:57,718 --> 02:17:59,700
not control it, that time they do

2192
02:17:59,700 --> 02:18:01,638
not control it, the

2193
02:18:01,638 --> 02:18:03,450
technology tools do not

2194
02:18:03,450 --> 02:18:05,398
control it because at some point

2195
02:18:05,398 --> 02:18:07,228
someone has to make it public and if

2196
02:18:07,228 --> 02:18:08,429
someone never makes it public then

2197
02:18:08,429 --> 02:18:09,420
we could be living  with a

2198
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:11,010
vulnerability like the one we

2199
02:18:11,010 --> 02:18:13,410
found some time ago in adobe that had

2200
02:18:13,410 --> 02:18:15,388
been a steel vulnerability for years

2201
02:18:15,388 --> 02:18:17,670
and no one was steel anymore it was like year

2202
02:18:17,670 --> 02:18:20,040
zero and that way it has never been when

2203
02:18:20,040 --> 02:18:22,379
I found out I was initially it was the

2204
02:18:22,379 --> 02:18:24,269
question that  we make ourselves here in

2205
02:18:24,269 --> 02:18:25,590
the response team in hundreds of the

2206
02:18:25,590 --> 02:18:27,750
police when I find out I say here

2207
02:18:27,750 --> 02:18:30,510
at that time I depend 100% on a

2208
02:18:30,510 --> 02:18:32,580
third party from a parent company that

2209
02:18:32,580 --> 02:18:34,290
does through research to find

2210
02:18:34,290 --> 02:18:37,049
let's say if you are interested or not  interested

2211
02:18:37,049 --> 02:18:38,879
in where I can enter

2212
02:18:38,879 --> 02:18:41,370
a computer system abusively or not and the other is

2213
02:18:41,370 --> 02:18:42,599
when it was mitigated because that is the other

2214
02:18:42,599 --> 02:18:44,610
risk I find it and I find

2215
02:18:44,610 --> 02:18:46,349
that I have  a vulnerability through

2216
02:18:46,349 --> 02:18:48,480
x operating system but how

2217
02:18:48,480 --> 02:18:50,638
long does it take me to be able to mitigate that sometimes

2218
02:18:50,638 --> 02:18:52,080
let's say which ones we are in

2219
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:53,760
entities that we have to protect so

2220
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:54,840
big they tell us something we have to

2221
02:18:54,840 --> 02:18:57,179
patch absolutely everything and upload all

2222
02:18:57,179 --> 02:18:58,200
the latest versions of the

2223
02:18:58,200 --> 02:19:00,420
operating systems  but we come with an

2224
02:19:00,420 --> 02:19:02,429
issue of information system inheritances

2225
02:19:02,429 --> 02:19:04,410
that if you touch them and

2226
02:19:04,410 --> 02:19:06,090
if you patch them

2227
02:19:06,090 --> 02:19:07,888
immediately the business operation

2228
02:19:07,888 --> 02:19:09,480
goes to the floor because let's say it's

2229
02:19:09,480 --> 02:19:11,190
like the culture that is not a good

2230
02:19:11,190 --> 02:19:13,410
practice but the  culture that

2231
02:19:13,410 --> 02:19:15,388
most entities have and those are those

2232
02:19:15,388 --> 02:19:17,670
old legacy services that cannot

2233
02:19:17,670 --> 02:19:19,559
be touched because there is an affectation and

2234
02:19:19,559 --> 02:19:21,030
coincidentally that is like the most providing

2235
02:19:21,030 --> 02:19:23,760
the most problematic this has already led us

2236
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:25,290
but it is that we have the best

2237
02:19:25,290 --> 02:19:27,388
ally and the  The best ally is the person

2238
02:19:27,388 --> 02:19:30,360
and us at some point during 10

2239
02:19:30,360 --> 02:19:32,280
years, although if we made

2240
02:19:32,280 --> 02:19:34,980
awareness tools and if we made  The

2241
02:19:34,980 --> 02:19:36,809
typical test, let's say that one of the

2242
02:19:36,809 --> 02:19:38,468
social engineering,

2243
02:19:38,468 --> 02:19:40,450
what does the person do by giving him an

2244
02:19:40,450 --> 02:19:43,840
antich bowl or do we really accept it

2245
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:46,330
is that we were underestimating the

2246
02:19:46,330 --> 02:19:47,769
end user, that is, the user is

2247
02:19:47,769 --> 02:19:50,050
underestimated because, say, we

2248
02:19:50,050 --> 02:19:51,609
engineers and it is a self-criticism that

2249
02:19:51,609 --> 02:19:54,010
we do in  police let's say if at some

2250
02:19:54,010 --> 02:19:55,540
point any of those who are present

2251
02:19:55,540 --> 02:19:56,950
are heard I think I'm

2252
02:19:56,950 --> 02:19:58,930
doing it too it's the experience we

2253
02:19:58,930 --> 02:20:00,880
want to tell them one belittles us

2254
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:03,069
then one says hey I don't I don't have

2255
02:20:03,069 --> 02:20:04,300
to explain social engineering because

2256
02:20:04,300 --> 02:20:06,489
he suddenly doesn't understand the  spam I

2257
02:20:06,489 --> 02:20:07,899
dedicate myself to placing an anti-spam that is

2258
02:20:07,899 --> 02:20:09,670
trying to mitigate it but there is always an

2259
02:20:09,670 --> 02:20:11,620
ernest plan that happens there will always be a

2260
02:20:11,620 --> 02:20:13,510
profile that arrives it is always worth a malware

2261
02:20:13,510 --> 02:20:14,859
that arrives because that depends on a

2262
02:20:14,859 --> 02:20:16,989
steel vulnerability and that already the

2263
02:20:16,989 --> 02:20:19,600
machines there the  exceeds as at the closing the

2264
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:21,040
previous closing of the talk the machines said it

2265
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:23,500
has a limit and until then

2266
02:20:23,500 --> 02:20:25,180
let's say it is the point at which

2267
02:20:25,180 --> 02:20:27,160
technician  Only we could protect

2268
02:20:27,160 --> 02:20:28,660
but the graphs say hey you

2269
02:20:28,660 --> 02:20:30,220
technically you can't need a

2270
02:20:30,220 --> 02:20:32,170
little more help and we believe

2271
02:20:32,170 --> 02:20:33,930
that it is we believed let's say that the

2272
02:20:33,930 --> 02:20:36,850
strategy is that it comes trained the

2273
02:20:36,850 --> 02:20:38,560
best sensors that exist are the

2274
02:20:38,560 --> 02:20:40,630
well-trained end users

2275
02:20:40,630 --> 02:20:42,160
obviously because otherwise they won't  he trains all

2276
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:44,530
of a sudden he does a few things that are too much for him he

2277
02:20:44,530 --> 02:20:47,261
doesn't take the time to

2278
02:20:47,261 --> 02:20:50,170
teach people the risk 11 in the

2279
02:20:50,170 --> 02:20:51,880
physical world in the physical world he is very

2280
02:20:51,880 --> 02:20:53,590
clear that it is a risk and that it is not a

2281
02:20:53,590 --> 02:20:56,080
risk one in the physical world knows that even

2282
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:58,181
when  exposes one to risk one knows

2283
02:20:58,181 --> 02:20:59,320
that one cannot go out at certain times of the

2284
02:20:59,320 --> 02:21:01,360
night one knows that the door has to

2285
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:03,820
be well closed one knows that one

2286
02:21:03,820 --> 02:21:05,261
has to control the children with

2287
02:21:05,261 --> 02:21:06,700
friends who are in the neighborhood things of

2288
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:08,230
style is the risk  of the physical world

2289
02:21:08,230 --> 02:21:10,540
for us humans is very easy

2290
02:21:10,540 --> 02:21:14,471
but digital risk is not and I think that the

2291
02:21:14,471 --> 02:21:16,150
reflection that we did that already by

2292
02:21:16,150 --> 02:21:18,761
teaching them digital risk  and

2293
02:21:18,761 --> 02:21:20,830
that is let's say one of the

2294
02:21:20,830 --> 02:21:22,030
first issues that I come to tell you about

2295
02:21:22,030 --> 02:21:24,221
here and that is that we design

2296
02:21:24,221 --> 02:21:25,660
this strategy, it is a strategy that

2297
02:21:25,660 --> 02:21:28,870
we arrived at six seven months ago and it is to

2298
02:21:28,870 --> 02:21:30,460
define that in three phases to be able to

2299
02:21:30,460 --> 02:21:34,150
take 180,000 people from a

2300
02:21:34,150 --> 02:21:37,690
didactic topic and a topic that is not bone of the bone

2301
02:21:37,690 --> 02:21:39,370
as it could not be because many

2302
02:21:39,370 --> 02:21:40,391
times the topic of insurance the information

2303
02:21:40,391 --> 02:21:42,730
yields and sorry for the expression as a

2304
02:21:42,730 --> 02:21:44,561
fed up topic that is what name I cannot see

2305
02:21:44,561 --> 02:21:45,880
youtube that is that I cannot see the

2306
02:21:45,880 --> 02:21:47,650
news that I want  watch a movie that

2307
02:21:47,650 --> 02:21:49,840
because it blocked my usb that because my

2308
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:51,460
password has to be 10 sided it's

2309
02:21:51,460 --> 02:21:53,170
not even the phone number

2310
02:21:53,170 --> 02:21:54,520
how am I going to learn accounting

2311
02:21:54,520 --> 02:21:56,140
and strategy all those

2312
02:21:56,140 --> 02:21:57,820
cumbersome topics make me lazy

2313
02:21:57,820 --> 02:21:59,680
so what we did was  define this

2314
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:01,930
in three phases it's a few weeks here

2315
02:22:01,930 --> 02:22:04,000
let's say we have these let's say the

2316
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,860
latest update and not if we

2317
02:22:05,860 --> 02:22:07,800
dedicate the first part to training

2318
02:22:07,800 --> 02:22:10,360
let's say with short videos  to everyone

2319
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:13,000
to tell them listen batteries that there are some

2320
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,650
legal issues batteries that there is an issue of

2321
02:22:14,650 --> 02:22:16,390
personal data there are some

2322
02:22:16,390 --> 02:22:17,830
hygiene issues there are some benefits there are some

2323
02:22:17,830 --> 02:22:19,750
commitments there is an administration there are

2324
02:22:19,750 --> 02:22:21,370
things that you have to know

2325
02:22:21,370 --> 02:22:22,780
ensures the information is not something that

2326
02:22:22,780 --> 02:22:24,820
is  of the engineers is something that covers

2327
02:22:24,820 --> 02:22:26,950
from the police we are, let's say, by

2328
02:22:26,950 --> 02:22:30,820
grades, let's say the lowest grade is

2329
02:22:30,820 --> 02:22:32,229
auxiliary, which are the boys who

2330
02:22:32,229 --> 02:22:34,120
help us to do their military service, which

2331
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:36,070
here in Colombia is, let's say, optional

2332
02:22:36,070 --> 02:22:37,840
now and in the end, well, the director of the

2333
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:39,400
police  that he is a general gentleman

2334
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:40,750
everyone has to know the same aspect

2335
02:22:40,750 --> 02:22:42,580
and everyone has to be

2336
02:22:42,580 --> 02:22:44,860
in this wave after this we put a

2337
02:22:44,860 --> 02:22:47,800
topic of application phase and that

2338
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:49,630
application phase was a very didactic course a short course

2339
02:22:49,630 --> 02:22:52,780
of 40 hours  with issues of

2340
02:22:52,780 --> 02:22:55,270
hey don't click here

2341
02:22:55,270 --> 02:22:57,279
if you get an email so it's going to

2342
02:22:57,279 --> 02:23:00,100
be how you would address that to what

2343
02:23:00,100 --> 02:23:01,869
legal and criminal repercussions

2344
02:23:01,869 --> 02:23:03,819
you can  and see immersed but in

2345
02:23:03,819 --> 02:23:06,010
a very didactic way that is not technical at all because

2346
02:23:06,010 --> 02:23:08,109
when I open it to someone that if he

2347
02:23:08,109 --> 02:23:09,850
downloads a file, he suddenly exploits

2348
02:23:09,850 --> 02:23:13,029
the vulnerability cb 2018 25 36 well

2349
02:23:13,029 --> 02:23:14,109
first the guy doesn't even know what

2350
02:23:14,109 --> 02:23:15,789
a vulnerability is and that's where we're going to

2351
02:23:15,789 --> 02:23:18,460
start  to lose let's say the desire

2352
02:23:18,460 --> 02:23:19,720
that someone wants to learn

2353
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:21,369
today people like to learn this a lot

2354
02:23:21,369 --> 02:23:24,970
but there is a problem normally

2355
02:23:24,970 --> 02:23:25,750


2356
02:23:25,750 --> 02:23:28,029
humanity parents teach their children and

2357
02:23:28,029 --> 02:23:29,140
that way we

2358
02:23:29,140 --> 02:23:30,550
say generating knowledge

2359
02:23:30,550 --> 02:23:32,140
nowadays children  they are being their parents

2360
02:23:32,140 --> 02:23:34,270
and with a serious problem in this area to

2361
02:23:34,270 --> 02:23:35,319
secure information and that is that the

2362
02:23:35,319 --> 02:23:36,760
children have never been taught the risks

2363
02:23:36,760 --> 02:23:38,380
so you don't give them the risks

2364
02:23:38,380 --> 02:23:40,390
that starts in a chain and

2365
02:23:40,390 --> 02:23:42,789
that's why everyone shares information enters chat

2366
02:23:42,789 --> 02:23:44,380
they are  he steals personal data they

2367
02:23:44,380 --> 02:23:46,029
steal his credit card he uploads the

2368
02:23:46,029 --> 02:23:47,289
credit card as a photo on

2369
02:23:47,289 --> 02:23:48,760
whatsapp because he imagines that it goes

2370
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:50,409
between cell phones but it is an issue

2371
02:23:50,409 --> 02:23:51,939
purely out of conscience and that

2372
02:23:51,939 --> 02:23:53,199
technically he never loves being able to

2373
02:23:53,199 --> 02:23:54,609
control it we will never be able to

2374
02:23:54,609 --> 02:23:56,550
control it because there are things that for

2375
02:23:56,550 --> 02:23:59,199
security and privacy we cannot

2376
02:23:59,199 --> 02:24:01,479
see and in the end there is an issue let's say

2377
02:24:01,479 --> 02:24:01,899
check

2378
02:24:01,899 --> 02:24:03,819
to see if that issue works or not

2379
02:24:03,819 --> 02:24:07,060
later  After doing

2380
02:24:07,060 --> 02:24:09,520
this, we dismantle this platform, which is

2381
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:10,419
the platform that I really want to

2382
02:24:10,419 --> 02:24:12,310
share with you, and I tell you all

2383
02:24:12,310 --> 02:24:15,430
this so that we can show you the,

2384
02:24:15,430 --> 02:24:17,979
let's say where we got to, and the input that

2385
02:24:17,979 --> 02:24:20,470
we give them when we have a

2386
02:24:20,470 --> 02:24:22,029
trained or moderately

2387
02:24:22,029 --> 02:24:23,890
trained population, give them some  tools

2388
02:24:23,890 --> 02:24:26,470
like these make them very useful the

2389
02:24:26,470 --> 02:24:27,789
national police has one of these services it

2390
02:24:27,789 --> 02:24:29,680
is a global service

2391
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:34,119
let's say today we have 3500

2392
02:24:34,119 --> 02:24:37,550
2500 registered and 2500 written on this

2393
02:24:37,550 --> 02:24:39,350
platform this platform is

2394
02:24:39,350 --> 02:24:41,720
public access and what we do here is publish

2395
02:24:41,720 --> 02:24:44,359
newsletters about  phishing about

2396
02:24:44,359 --> 02:24:46,220
malware about social engineering

2397
02:24:46,220 --> 02:24:48,829
about news about personal

2398
02:24:48,829 --> 02:24:50,869
data protection  ales about good

2399
02:24:50,869 --> 02:24:52,850
practices in secure information is

2400
02:24:52,850 --> 02:24:54,470
let's say the first component that is

2401
02:24:54,470 --> 02:24:56,449
publicly accessible there is another there is another

2402
02:24:56,449 --> 02:24:57,709
publicly accessible component that if

2403
02:24:57,709 --> 02:24:59,881
you are both

2404
02:24:59,881 --> 02:25:02,161
one one can let's say one of the

2405
02:25:02,161 --> 02:25:03,181
components of a computer incident response team

2406
02:25:03,181 --> 02:25:04,801
expose a

2407
02:25:04,801 --> 02:25:06,241
line to the public  in which people are informed,

2408
02:25:06,241 --> 02:25:07,951
but even though one

2409
02:25:07,951 --> 02:25:10,220
has many capabilities

2410
02:25:10,220 --> 02:25:12,410
of people backwards and has many

2411
02:25:12,410 --> 02:25:13,910
people sitting down to answer emails,

2412
02:25:13,910 --> 02:25:15,859
this topic does not become as efficient

2413
02:25:15,859 --> 02:25:17,930
and at some point the person gets

2414
02:25:17,930 --> 02:25:19,850
lazy and says hey  but the thing is that I

2415
02:25:19,850 --> 02:25:21,319
need to open the email, and it is going to

2416
02:25:21,319 --> 02:25:22,850
give us an example of an email that has

2417
02:25:22,850 --> 02:25:24,560
an apparent spam to a person, it is not

2418
02:25:24,560 --> 02:25:26,210
written and tells us I want you to

2419
02:25:26,210 --> 02:25:27,620
check me if this email is spam,

2420
02:25:27,620 --> 02:25:29,540
the only way to answer in

2421
02:25:29,540 --> 02:25:30,890
real time is that I have the number of

2422
02:25:30,890 --> 02:25:32,810
operators, more or less to see them, the

2423
02:25:32,810 --> 02:25:34,160
number of people who write to me and

2424
02:25:34,160 --> 02:25:36,529
that, let's say operationally, it does not have

2425
02:25:36,529 --> 02:25:37,939
a good co  sto-benefit

2426
02:25:37,939 --> 02:25:39,590
then we assembled both of them through

2427
02:25:39,590 --> 02:25:41,899
this q which is an open source and what we

2428
02:25:41,899 --> 02:25:43,939
did was put an ace on both of them so

2429
02:25:43,939 --> 02:25:45,950
that the malware uploads its file

2430
02:25:45,950 --> 02:25:48,290
which can make a strange file that

2431
02:25:48,290 --> 02:25:49,850
you say you don't see it anymore

2432
02:25:49,850 --> 02:25:51,920
previously trained I am to verify

2433
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:53,600
that the email suddenly the sender

2434
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:55,550
is not you suddenly you are impersonating a

2435
02:25:55,550 --> 02:25:57,410
bank it is the person you already have

2436
02:25:57,410 --> 02:25:59,810
basic knowledge there you arrive upload your

2437
02:25:59,810 --> 02:26:01,370
file and unasam bulls like everything we

2438
02:26:01,370 --> 02:26:02,270
are here

2439
02:26:02,270 --> 02:26:03,649
we know well it tells you if it is  or no,

2440
02:26:03,649 --> 02:26:05,930
someone will say hey, but it's because both

2441
02:26:05,930 --> 02:26:09,460
are not 100% obviously that has a

2442
02:26:09,460 --> 02:26:12,350
layer and in which but the number of

2443
02:26:12,350 --> 02:26:14,989
people who are going to avoid each other and

2444
02:26:14,989 --> 02:26:16,340
train and start raising

2445
02:26:16,340 --> 02:26:17,120
awareness are more

2446
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:18,800
the small group  of people who

2447
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:21,021
can casually upload a file

2448
02:26:21,021 --> 02:26:23,630
and both tell them that it is not a tree and

2449
02:26:23,630 --> 02:26:24,860
I know that it is not malware it is because it is

2450
02:26:24,860 --> 02:26:26,420
zero-day malware it is malware that has

2451
02:26:26,420 --> 02:26:28,280
just come out and it is what we already had

2452
02:26:28,280 --> 02:26:30,021
let's say at  at some point but the person

2453
02:26:30,021 --> 02:26:32,480
has in his head the concept that

2454
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:34,490
this is strange or they never

2455
02:26:34,490 --> 02:26:35,990
write to me from microsoft- saying that I

2456
02:26:35,990 --> 02:26:38,000
win a laptop for being the

2457
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,160
millionth user that we say is the typical

2458
02:26:40,160 --> 02:26:41,330
one that one says here but it goes on

2459
02:26:41,330 --> 02:26:43,460
repeating and now they have evolved it

2460
02:26:43,460 --> 02:26:45,950
with cryptocurrency they have evolved it

2461
02:26:45,950 --> 02:26:49,280
with issues of these multilevel companies

2462
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:51,740
multilevel things of that style that

2463
02:26:51,740 --> 02:26:53,900
generate or promise

2464
02:26:53,900 --> 02:26:56,420
immediate profits and before that person it

2465
02:26:56,420 --> 02:26:57,860
is very complicated but if I give them

2466
02:26:57,860 --> 02:27:00,190
this tool it allows them to analyze

2467
02:27:00,190 --> 02:27:02,000
nationally we give you another

2468
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:02,900
tool that is also

2469
02:27:02,900 --> 02:27:05,271
publicly accessible and it is the analysis of the freckles

2470
02:27:05,271 --> 02:27:07,220
that you install applications on

2471
02:27:07,220 --> 02:27:08,720
cell phones sorry then on

2472
02:27:08,720 --> 02:27:11,000
cell phones we have a high risk and

2473
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:12,950
that is that everyone installs the application

2474
02:27:12,950 --> 02:27:15,320
let's say it is not legal and booted  a

2475
02:27:15,320 --> 02:27:17,420
problem that nobody knew or here

2476
02:27:17,420 --> 02:27:19,040
we did a survey and nobody knew that it

2477
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:20,390
existed in official stores to

2478
02:27:20,390 --> 02:27:22,250
download  Arlas, one would think that everyone

2479
02:27:22,250 --> 02:27:24,140
knows him, but people really know those things,

2480
02:27:24,140 --> 02:27:26,029
they are not topics that

2481
02:27:26,029 --> 02:27:27,170
they stop to think about, nobody

2482
02:27:27,170 --> 02:27:29,300
imagines that they are going to supplant a store

2483
02:27:29,300 --> 02:27:31,550
like Google Play or the iPhone store or

2484
02:27:31,550 --> 02:27:33,319
the Huawei store, any of the

2485
02:27:33,319 --> 02:27:34,970
stores  of smartphones here the people

2486
02:27:34,970 --> 02:27:37,130
our our policemen upload and well

2487
02:27:37,130 --> 02:27:38,779
the citizens in general upload the

2488
02:27:38,779 --> 02:27:40,100
application and there it tells you what your

2489
02:27:40,100 --> 02:27:42,170
level is what your level of risk is

2490
02:27:42,170 --> 02:27:43,460
what are the permissions that you have

2491
02:27:43,460 --> 02:27:45,409
to grant what is the whole issue that it

2492
02:27:45,409 --> 02:27:47,569
generates and  in the end let's say that this topic

2493
02:27:47,569 --> 02:27:49,399
does need a login but not why

2494
02:27:49,399 --> 02:27:53,449
not because it's not for not because it's not for

2495
02:27:53,449 --> 02:27:55,220
let's say access for everyone

2496
02:27:55,220 --> 02:27:56,540
but because we want to control the

2497
02:27:56,540 --> 02:27:59,149
computers that enter here are they are

2498
02:27:59,149 --> 02:28:01,189
'a ctf then it's a  capture to flag

2499
02:28:01,189 --> 02:28:03,859
we put today we have 318

2500
02:28:03,859 --> 02:28:06,649
written teams there are teams from Colombia for

2501
02:28:06,649 --> 02:28:08,120
the most part but from Latin

2502
02:28:08,120 --> 02:28:09,949
America Ibero-America in which they have some

2503
02:28:09,949 --> 02:28:12,170
challenges and we have found and this  And it has

2504
02:28:12,170 --> 02:28:13,970
served us for something and it is that we have

2505
02:28:13,970 --> 02:28:16,340
found very valuable people

2506
02:28:16,340 --> 02:28:17,930
with capacities that they did not even

2507
02:28:17,930 --> 02:28:19,850
know they knew and with these

2508
02:28:19,850 --> 02:28:21,890
challenges we have been training them

2509
02:28:21,890 --> 02:28:24,020
that is what I wanted to tell you and to

2510
02:28:24,020 --> 02:28:25,729
finish we have these two

2511
02:28:25,729 --> 02:28:27,739
conclusions and it is  that as peter

2512
02:28:27,739 --> 02:28:29,510
drucker says what is not measured is not improved

2513
02:28:29,510 --> 02:28:31,279
if we had not had the

2514
02:28:31,279 --> 02:28:33,260
indicators one could deliver

2515
02:28:33,260 --> 02:28:34,880
the information security to some machines

2516
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:37,010
and really there is a very

2517
02:28:37,010 --> 02:28:38,810
large gap initially the machines

2518
02:28:38,810 --> 02:28:42,080
obviously have a

2519
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:43,460
mitigation capacity that  a human is never going to

2520
02:28:43,460 --> 02:28:44,540
have it but it has to be closely

2521
02:28:44,540 --> 02:28:46,220
accompanied by a human talent

2522
02:28:46,220 --> 02:28:48,050
initially who knows how to manage it

2523
02:28:48,050 --> 02:28:49,880
who knows how to configure it and who does not leave them do

2524
02:28:49,880 --> 02:28:51,050
not leave them as the manufacturers deliver them

2525
02:28:51,050 --> 02:28:53,449
and the other is some users

2526
02:28:53,449 --> 02:28:54,560
who help feed them

2527
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:56,449
efficiently and with criteria that at the

2528
02:28:56,449 --> 02:28:58,250
time does not happen and in the end, well, you have

2529
02:28:58,250 --> 02:29:00,290
to take a look at the basics sometimes

2530
02:29:00,290 --> 02:29:03,680
dedicate  We do things very technological issues and

2531
02:29:03,680 --> 02:29:05,750
really the solution I think is

2532
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:08,600
easier than one imagines that is

2533
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:10,699
what I wanted to tell you about the corrido so

2534
02:29:10,699 --> 02:29:12,949
that it would not happen to me and I think I did it is

2535
02:29:12,949 --> 02:29:14,301
active

2536
02:29:14,301 --> 02:29:19,570
yes the truth that training

2537
02:29:20,200 --> 02:29:22,271
[Laughter]

2538
02:29:22,271 --> 02:29:25,820
good  Thank you very much, very interesting,

2539
02:29:25,820 --> 02:29:30,101
the truth is that we

2540
02:29:30,900 --> 02:29:33,841
found the proposal very interesting,

2541
02:29:33,841 --> 02:29:37,381
the truth is that I would be able to replicate it in

2542
02:29:37,381 --> 02:29:38,400
the organizations,

2543
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:41,940
we have two questions in the

2544
02:29:41,940 --> 02:29:44,040
question and answer chat and I have a

2545
02:29:44,040 --> 02:29:46,261
comment from Paula Venosa who works

2546
02:29:46,261 --> 02:29:49,141
to be part of the  national university of la

2547
02:29:49,141 --> 02:29:51,931
plata argentina that I did I liked what

2548
02:29:51,931 --> 02:29:53,070
this raises regarding

2549
02:29:53,070 --> 02:29:55,440
awareness the concept of appropriation

2550
02:29:55,440 --> 02:29:58,950
of appropriation of phase 2 there is a well-

2551
02:29:58,950 --> 02:30:01,771
known colleague in Argentina

2552
02:30:01,771 --> 02:30:04,830
called a mixed mara mafias who says

2553
02:30:04,830 --> 02:30:07,080
that more people than seeing them as  weakest link

2554
02:30:07,080 --> 02:30:09,330
we have to see them as the

2555
02:30:09,330 --> 02:30:11,190
first defense barrier of our

2556
02:30:11,190 --> 02:30:13,530
organization and I think it has to do

2557
02:30:13,530 --> 02:30:16,080
with that concept of grac appropriation  ias

2558
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:18,511
that was one of a comment from

2559
02:30:18,511 --> 02:30:21,450
paula and now i have

2560
02:30:21,450 --> 02:30:25,090
two questions

2561
02:30:25,090 --> 02:30:27,790
we continue with the questions ernesto pérez

2562
02:30:27,790 --> 02:30:30,760
estevez is a colleague who works in the

2563
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:34,560
cdia de ecuador

2564
02:30:34,560 --> 02:30:37,899
the rest comment on whether we used

2565
02:30:37,899 --> 02:30:41,170
your sandbox that day thank you very much  so

2566
02:30:41,170 --> 02:30:43,390
you can see that not only in Colombia

2567
02:30:43,390 --> 02:30:46,930
are they using the shampoo and in my case it

2568
02:30:46,930 --> 02:30:48,700
is not a question but a congratulations

2569
02:30:48,700 --> 02:30:51,490
because it is precisely the end user with

2570
02:30:51,490 --> 02:30:53,439
the weakest voice on the issue of

2571
02:30:53,439 --> 02:30:55,540
security if the end user is prepared

2572
02:30:55,540 --> 02:30:58,450
they will be issued  many possible problems,

2573
02:30:58,450 --> 02:31:03,220
well, everything has its edges, that is, we

2574
02:31:03,220 --> 02:31:05,140
see it as the first barrier as the

2575
02:31:05,140 --> 02:31:07,630
weakest link, but this is because of the

2576
02:31:07,630 --> 02:31:10,510
user, I think this is where

2577
02:31:10,510 --> 02:31:13,350
we have to agree, we

2578
02:31:13,350 --> 02:31:17,040
have to focus, I would like you to

2579
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:19,649
provide some comment to our

2580
02:31:19,649 --> 02:31:21,920
colleagues

2581
02:31:23,580 --> 02:31:25,990
and thank you very much

2582
02:31:25,990 --> 02:31:28,420
I did not know that they used it in Ecuador

2583
02:31:28,420 --> 02:31:30,580
anything let's say that you see

2584
02:31:30,580 --> 02:31:32,320
that we can improve in us we have

2585
02:31:32,320 --> 02:31:34,330
our mail here we are part of the ci  rsa

2586
02:31:34,330 --> 02:31:37,900
11 years ago and the idea is to improve

2587
02:31:37,900 --> 02:31:40,090
today we are implementing it and

2588
02:31:40,090 --> 02:31:42,190
the idea is if you have in your in

2589

mail we agree

2591
02:31:46,420 --> 02:31:48,641
we synchronize them we have here a

2592
02:31:48,641 --> 02:31:50,440
taxonomy that we have already  done let's say and

2593
02:31:50,440 --> 02:31:52,660
we are maturing thank you very much for your

2594

well this barbarian then we have

2598
02:32:01,899 --> 02:32:06,610
any other questions please

2599
02:32:06,610 --> 02:32:08,860
because there were people who could not write

2600
02:32:08,860 --> 02:32:11,710
in the manage the questions and

2601
02:32:11,710 --> 02:32:14,340
answers
