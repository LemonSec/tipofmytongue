17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:01:02,459
from this microphone that'll just put

18
00:00:43,650 --> 00:01:04,620
over here so I went to see so that being

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,170
done just let you know as a bilingual

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,420
Canadian I neither master French nor

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,770
English don't be surprised if you hear

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,410
some strange words come out of me on

23
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,020
occasions I would like to say a couple

24
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,490
of things first before I start down in

25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,140
front of me right here and I'm a

26
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,690
reference them a couple of times are my

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,000
two heckling tables these are people

28
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,100
with whom I have had the greatest honor

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,630
of working for the last six and a half

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,550
years I am as adjudicated the chief of

31
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,949
Halifax Regional Police but I am so

32
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,850
entitled only I'm on pre-retirement

33
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:45,150
leave right now

34
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:48,149
and that policing and going on to doing

35
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,799
other things but I want to recognize the

36
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,240
presence of three young people here

37
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,360
because I think it's so critically

38
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,310
important that in our society today that

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,970
when we encourage these young people

40
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:05,490
into that we especially recognize women

41
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:08,299
in areas that are non-traditional young

42
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,160
people are our Simran singing car

43
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:12,950
Bendixon and Selena Kozma so the folks

44
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,090
who just want to stand up very quickly

45
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,660
and we need a big hand for these young

46
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,700
people here

47
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:24,829
[Applause]

48
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:28,609
thank you very much obviously so I am

49
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:32,060
NOT Clifford Stoll right I I saw your

50
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:36,049
tweets yesterday holy moly you know the

51
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,700
best you know the stuff that he was

52
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:38,870
doing I was talking to the techie guys

53
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,208
earlier on and they were talking about

54
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,459
that he actually had the audacity ask

55
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:47,090
for an overhead projector well if he had

56
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:50,209
had a chance to see his that's all about

57
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,310
so I did ask for one problem is here I

58
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,560
promise you I will not be standing on

59
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,329
that table I promise you I will not be

60
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:02,209
standing on a chair I will be standing

61
00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:05,359
here today I think he was saying that he

62
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:09,170
would be and he said the reason why he

63
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:10,909
runs around the stage and off the stage

64
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,839
everything is because he thinks that

65
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:16,159
everybody in the audience has a tomato

66
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,680
radius for him he doesn't want to stay

67
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,440
in one place in order to be a target for

68
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,419
them so I think I might be a bit more

69
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,329
amenable to that and be a bit of a

70
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:27,709
target for the next 45 minutes as I talk

71
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:29,359
to you but nonetheless I wanted you to

72
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:31,069
know one first and foremost for those of

73
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:33,049
you who may not be able to see that far

74
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:38,448
away as you can see I'm definitely not

75
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:40,910
Clifford so so so with that as indicated

76
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:42,919
I am a police chief I'm a father I'm a

77
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,540
minor hockey referee as if there's not

78
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,549
enough stress in my life that's

79
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:52,690
something that I enjoy very much or with

80
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:52,690
my daughter I guess you could say

81
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:01,549
co-recipients let's see yes the 2019

82
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,680
what the SWOT award by the Electronic

83
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:07,370
Frontier Foundation is Cory Doctorow

84
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,560
here I guess you didn't bring my work

85
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,699
but nonetheless just let you know and

86
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,730
for those of you who may not have been

87
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:15,560
aware of it April 2018 there's a search

88
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,519
of the Halifax home following a

89
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,918
complaint of a theft

90
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,530
online files from the government of Nova

91
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:24,469
Scotia and at the heart of the matter

92
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:25,789
with some poor security practices and

93
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,909
the Nova Scotia Public Prosecution

94
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:30,710
Service end up dropping those charges

95
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:32,690
this is a cautionary tale

96
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,489
how police sometimes deal with

97
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,310
legitimate complaints that they've never

98
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:40,039
dealt with before we were obliged to

99
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,990
investigate and interest gatekeepers of

100
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,270
the judicial system from the public

101
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,400
prosecution service defense lawyers and

102
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,070
of course the judges themselves by

103
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,388
secondary and tertiary layers of

104
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:57,169
protections this is always go right know

105
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:58,850
the system pretty well works I'll tell

106
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:02,479
you for my time in the United Nations

107
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:05,150
two years I've seen other countries

108
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,460
where unfortunately their systems don't

109
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:10,460
work in the case of first-time

110
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,169
investigations response by police and

111
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,919
very for being perceived as being heavy

112
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:16,758
handed to that of total disinterest

113
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:19,250
especially when it comes to the issue of

114
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,530
technology this is how we as police

115
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,050
learn how to do things and especially

116
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:29,299
how not to do things and that's what I

117
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:34,699
want to talk to you about today so we

118
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:36,740
live in a very complex environment full

119
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:38,900
of ambiguities and contradictions that

120
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,090
need to be managed not by simple

121
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:44,500
solutions by well thought of approaches

122
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:56,210
that require time effort money and

123
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:59,570
especially legal judicial policing

124
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:01,070
sphere but from society as a whole and

125
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,979
as human beings were really great at

126
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:06,050
something called post dating after the

127
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:10,099
fact we're really loud as he had

128
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:14,030
predicted must be cognizant of this very

129
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:17,060
important limitation and such we have to

130
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:20,020
be focused on preparation and

131
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,220
preparedness as opposed to prediction

132
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,580
the challenges of today and the

133
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:29,330
challenges of the future require us to

134
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:35,120
change how we've been working very hard

135
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:37,219
on please the proposal popularized by

136
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,950
Hollywood and our popular culture makes

137
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:43,139
us see the world as more tidy simple

138
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:45,419
predictable and come here truly

139
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:48,330
the illusion that one has understood the

140
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:50,878
past feeds the FIR delusion that one can

141
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,770
predict and control the future of course

142
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,020
these illusions are comforting but

143
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:58,340
they're also very wrong

144
00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:02,659
the British security service mi5

145
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:05,940
restated a are diffused complicated and

146
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:07,860
unpredictable well first in some history

147
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:12,620
in this room question after use the

148
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:15,509
following what have you never been that

149
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:22,319
so that is backdrop I like to us take a

150
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:25,020
look briefly yet what is policing now

151
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,270
the American view of policing is one of

152
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,270
the server protect and we've adopted

153
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,818
that to certainly agree here in Canada

154
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:35,639
but it's a lot more than just that when

155
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,680
I ask people police office included what

156
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:42,889
exactly is policing they come up with a

157
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:45,569
whole series of things alright speaking

158
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:48,870
well when it comes down to it the most

159
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:50,940
basic elementary level of policing is

160
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,759
dealing with those problems that people

161
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:58,740
themselves could not we're not and

162
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:01,500
should not deal with so in essence we

163
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:05,819
are the consummate community problem

164
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:08,610
solvers we get requests for all types of

165
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:12,330
things yes for crime but other things

166
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:17,219
such as being locked in a car having an

167
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:20,039
animal that is locked in a car and if we

168
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:24,779
get requests for noise requests for

169
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:27,870
smoking cannabis we get all types of

170
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:30,870
requests recently I had he studied two

171
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:35,159
studies done one in June 2015 the other

172
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:36,810
in September of 2018 for our integrated

173
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,059
emergency services basically our

174
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:41,359
dispatch center to take a look at the

175
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:48,000
number of calls what percentage of calls

176
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:49,800
were not of a crime nature and it

177
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,410
surprised me I forget a little bit about

178
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,280
sixty seventy percent eighty eight

179
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,699
percent

180
00:08:53,280 --> 00:09:03,329
of our calls had nothing to do with

181
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:06,080
crime for me as police officers we bring

182
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,670
to the table three particular things

183
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,230
one for every intervention that we come

184
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:14,610
across we bring specialized training to

185
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,770
we bring specialized equipment you just

186
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:20,370
have to take a look on what our police

187
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:23,160
officers wear today and three we bring

188
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,020
along specialized authorities those

189
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,709
authorities give us the right to write

190
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:32,819
tickets to arrest people to use force if

191
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:37,560
required to search places with the

192
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:39,110
judicial authorization but one thing's

193
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,800
for certain

194
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:45,480
there's also perceptions in a these

195
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,849
perceptions come about as a result a

196
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,370
median I'm not slamming traditional or

197
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:55,400
even social media on this one that's all

198
00:09:50,370 --> 00:10:00,080
part of donuts friendly innocuous inept

199
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:09,689
abusive crimes gets all this tonight for

200
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:11,820
those watch Simpsons I don't get a

201
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,700
chance to watch that much but from what

202
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:18,320
I've heard on CI yes what's it for

203
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:21,360
around for their DNA 24 hours even less

204
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:27,200
for us when we send submit something to

205
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:31,860
the RCMP crime labs in turnaround

206
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,440
between 3 and 18 months the situation

207
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,080
ballistics are now upwards of 12 months

208
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,380
to a year of a not mistaken 12 months 16

209
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,670
to 18 months it takes a lot of time it's

210
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,360
very very different from the perception

211
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,709
desire out there paraphrase the comedian

212
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,860
Danny Kaye and that's of course another

213
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:52,980
generation my parents generation he said

214
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,440
that my quote his favorite position was

215
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,920
beside himself and his favorite sport

216
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,330
was jumping to conclusions so specific

217
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,378
the policing today one of our biggest

218
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,619
challenges

219
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:08,160
dealing with perceptions both public and

220
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:10,099
individual very often having little or

221
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,149
no basis in fact

222
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:15,509
unfortunately perceptions have a direct

223
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:17,609
link to public trust so people's

224
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:21,869
perceptions are indeed their realities

225
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:22,919
and we have to live with that reality so

226
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:28,529
what are some of the other realities

227
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:31,579
other people have been living we've seen

228
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:33,629
it especially in the last three years

229
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:36,628
worries about the militarization of

230
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:40,499
policing abusive force The Washington

231
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:45,389
Post has for the last four years come up

232
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:47,339
with a police shooting database that

233
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:50,039
talks about the number of Americans who

234
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:54,269
have been killed by police officers by

235
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:59,789
shootings that number usually oscillates

236
00:11:54,269 --> 00:12:01,919
just below thousand people a year and

237
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:03,269
you won't appreciate by even by The

238
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,139
Washington Post centers they're stating

239
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:12,949
that it's underreported 20,000 people

240
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:12,949
died through interactions with police in

241
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:23,519
car accidents doesn't include who died

242
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:25,379
in hand manipulation haven't died by

243
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,529
being struck by a teaser for example

244
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:31,799
energy well appreciate the numbers

245
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:35,009
whoever was at 1500 to 2000 now Canada

246
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:37,309
it was one-tenth the size of the United

247
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:41,789
States those numbers gonna be about 100

248
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:44,309
in Canada on average per year there's

249
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:47,009
about 25 individuals who died in

250
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:49,919
interactions with police and that's

251
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:54,509
being shot conducted energy weapons

252
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:59,549
being used and manipulation and

253
00:12:54,509 --> 00:13:00,870
transport there are more police officers

254
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:03,329
in Canada who commits

255
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:06,600
here than individuals who died in

256
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:12,180
interactions with police it's very very

257
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:16,140
different landscape for me right now at

258
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:18,000
least be aware that and we end up having

259
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,250
to deal with that on a regular basis

260
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,810
where people will draw the same

261
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,660
parallels and conclusions

262
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:30,530
I had a university professor a couple of

263
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:34,110
years ago in fact it was in July of 2000

264
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:36,120
a message saying what are we doing to

265
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:39,330
protect the lives of young black males

266
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,430
here at Halifax then going on and

267
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:44,880
talking about a litany of incidents that

268
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:48,599
occurred in the States which I couldn't

269
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,330
argue with two days later five police

270
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:55,260
officers were killed in Dallas and a

271
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:59,370
black lives matters rally I didn't

272
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:01,319
respond to that Professor so what we

273
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:06,270
recognize is that what happens there

274
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:09,030
matters here and hence once again the

275
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,810
whole issue about perceptions and

276
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:13,589
dealing with that

277
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:16,199
so our reality here in Halifax is

278
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:21,710
horrible in some regards but it's very

279
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:25,700
different in others sitting at 440,000

280
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:28,280
we have on average nine homicides a year

281
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:32,730
so far this year and I am touching would

282
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:34,670
zero homicides Toronto had record number

283
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:40,130
offices last year at ninety five

284
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:45,839
homicides about seven times the size of

285
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:47,520
Halifax main reasons obviously in there

286
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,710
one of them just recently was the

287
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,710
commemoration of the first anniversary

288
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:02,450
that occurred on Yonge Street but here

289
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:05,180
health facts we have three major

290
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:08,510
problems that we deal with that fuels

291
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,880
our call for services number three is

292
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:13,510
youth at risk the challenge is that

293
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:18,320
youth have to do with on a regular basis

294
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:27,490
number two is addictions and the number

295
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:29,810
one challenge is mental health calls

296
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:32,600
we've all heard the challenges that are

297
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:35,630
out there with our health systems that

298
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,250
are stretched to the maximum world

299
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:41,930
hotline and dealing with that on a

300
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:45,500
regular basis it's a B now now that we

301
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:51,920
are responders a first resort and not

302
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:55,510
responders or whatever initially we also

303
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,699
have to deal with the berries of this

304
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,800
that occurs lucky doesn't occur that

305
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:07,220
often but when it does we have to be

306
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:11,000
there but what we do when things get

307
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:14,600
increasingly complex such as the case of

308
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,430
the intersection between criminality and

309
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:21,970
Technology I attended a meeting of the

310
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:25,819
police executive Research Forum which is

311
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:27,380
the last year in Washington DC and the

312
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,860
whole discussion there was fifteen of us

313
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,520
brought lychees LAPD was there Chicago

314
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:37,370
was there

315
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:39,590
New York PD was there there and the

316
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:44,360
questions asked of us by the RAND

317
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:46,400
Corporation as well as the perform was

318
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,170
what are your priorities in terms of

319
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:52,699
technology and what are your greatest

320
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:55,069
fears parties all touched upon that in a

321
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:59,000
few moments the greatest fears was

322
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:01,720
around the Internet of Things everything

323
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,630
being plugged in everything being

324
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,780
available to people can also be

325
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:15,640
available

326
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:23,319
out there get into that let me set back

327
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:28,180
at it in time this year he recognized

328
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:39,189
out there okay this is my murse I've had

329
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:43,630
this for 27 years remember that I - yeah

330
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:46,210
and so this was the all the rage back in

331
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:49,630
the 90s and I found it's very very

332
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:53,740
worthwhile for me and this merge has a

333
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:55,420
section here for a phone this is where I

334
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,630
kept my Nokia phone the same phone that

335
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,640
my wife had advised me through a text

336
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:04,870
message that the Twin Towers had been

337
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,030
attacked on September the 11th 2001 back

338
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:09,280
when texting was just starting by the

339
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,600
way back then it was for free I've been

340
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,930
like coke dealers they wanted to offer

341
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:20,020
to us for free so we did but an

342
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:24,520
interesting piece in here if you can see

343
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:32,260
it perhaps my heckling tables can can

344
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:34,000
yell it out what is this PDA and it even

345
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,500
works okay

346
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,230
and the reason why it's still in my

347
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,790
murse is because there's bits of

348
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:43,540
information I've been able to put a lot

349
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:47,649
on to my out of my computer the first

350
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:52,510
time I came across a PDA was back in

351
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:53,980
2000 January 2002 right after y2k a

352
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:57,120
great opportunity to sell lots of

353
00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:01,120
computers everything was quieting down

354
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:04,060
and I was the file manager for a major

355
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:08,229
file in Montreal we were investigating

356
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:11,679
the largest importer of cocaine into

357
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,900
Canada he pay off the Mafia he paid off

358
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,720
the Hells Angels so that he'd be able to

359
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:19,300
import as much cocaine as they wanted to

360
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,150
and and we had been through judicial

361
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:26,040
authorizations following him and

362
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:30,070
following his contact from Columbia who

363
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:33,190
on a Friday was coming up to meet with

364
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:34,960
him to discuss a major importation of

365
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:40,060
coke one time a major I'm talking about

366
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:43,660
two tons of coke from Columbia so we had

367
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:46,600
a surveillance team on subject a who was

368
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:49,150
the Canadian and as soon as he arrived

369
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,379
we had a surveillance team on subject B

370
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,460
who is the kalam

371
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,920
and we were following them we were

372
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,410
tracking where they were going and sure

373
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,150
enough both teams were heading towards

374
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:01,070
the same spot and that same spot was a

375
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,950
Tim Horton's in the West Island of

376
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:06,350
Montreal and subject they the Canadian

377
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,360
goes into Tim Hortons orders of coffee

378
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,699
sits that on tables I think we all know

379
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,340
those Tim Hortons tables so it's

380
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:17,110
basically one table here and it's

381
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:20,330
attached to another separate table here

382
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:22,159
the Katyn sits at the table here the

383
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:29,649
columbian arrives orders of coffee

384
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:29,650
doesn't even drink his coffee table

385
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:36,770
we've got undercover teams inside the

386
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:39,590
Tim Hortons listening not with any

387
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,960
acoustic items but just with their own

388
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,909
ears to what's going on we've got

389
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,020
hispanophone who are in there because

390
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:49,600
they know that they're gonna be speaking

391
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:52,600
in Spanish they didn't even say a word

392
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:56,419
what they did was they both pulled out

393
00:20:52,600 --> 00:21:02,060
one of these put it one beside the other

394
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:05,000
and press the button the Colombian got

395
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,020
up a minute later he left without

396
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,600
touching his coffee

397
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:11,200
the Canadian sat there finished his

398
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,459
coffee and then left and we were left it

399
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,670
what the heck happened and that was it

400
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:19,070
Colombia went back to the airport he

401
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:22,250
stayed in the hotel the next morning he

402
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:24,439
took off and that was it and we learned

403
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:29,240
afterwards that they had exchanged

404
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:31,400
information about the importation we had

405
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,640
no idea what Bluetooth was at the time

406
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,610
and we certainly had no way of being

407
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,040
able to intercept that let alone

408
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:43,689
explaining it to a judge to be able to

409
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,690
obtain that authorization

410
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:55,440
a month later still in Montreal anybody

411
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:59,490
heard of remember mafia boy few people

412
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,370
there so mafia boy with young lad from

413
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,890
Indies all much wrong with social only

414
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,139
the westside of Montreux who launched a

415
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,670
series of highly publicized

416
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:11,430
denial-of-service attacks in February

417
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:15,720
2000 against large commercial websites

418
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:19,290
including Yahoo etrade eBay CNN FIFA

419
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,450
calm Amazon and Dell he also launched a

420
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:23,940
series of unsuccessful simultaneous

421
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,610
attacks against nine of the 13 root

422
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,040
nameservers at the time you know will

423
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:32,610
appreciate today with the challenges

424
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:34,080
that we have back then cyber security as

425
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:38,159
qualified as being essentially an

426
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,270
electronic Pearl Harbor now I wasn't

427
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,880
working in the unit I did the

428
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:44,700
investigations on him but I knew the

429
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,190
investigators who were there and I'm not

430
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,840
sure that they would have done any

431
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,580
investigation or have been able to do

432
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,310
any invasion investigation had it not

433
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:58,590
been for the assistance and especially

434
00:22:53,310 --> 00:23:02,250
the insistence of the FBI step a bit

435
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,629
further 2003 I'm now in Winnipeg I'm in

436
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,450
charge of major crimes for the entire

437
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:08,180
province of Manitoba and I have the

438
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,040
integrated Child Exploitation unit

439
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:14,400
basically kiddie porn you know that's

440
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:17,430
answering to me and it's kiddie porn

441
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,260
all day all the time and they're working

442
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:23,940
and it's just incredible to see even in

443
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:25,740
a province I think about 1.5 million

444
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,780
about two million of the most that

445
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,890
there's so much Katy porn that Sam we're

446
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,620
not talking about individuals who would

447
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:33,060
go in access individual websites we're

448
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,909
talking about individuals who would

449
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:38,850
collect significant amounts of images

450
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:42,800
who would share those images and in some

451
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,800
cases would even create their own images

452
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:50,610
victims ranged from 14 15 year old boys

453
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:53,720
and girls all the way down to 3 months

454
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,719
old children

455
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,149
we get this call when data from a

456
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,330
landlord who had gone into an apartment

457
00:23:58,149 --> 00:24:02,529
the apartment did pretty well empty but

458
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,059
the tenants have been paying a lot of it

459
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:05,440
was a bit of a problem with the the

460
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:07,509
heating in the apartment so he goes in

461
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,259
there unannounced and there's a whole

462
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:15,100
Bank of computers in the living room

463
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:18,759
nothing else he calls us up it's got to

464
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:20,080
be something you listen our people get a

465
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:22,440
search warrant they go in there they

466
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:27,090
take a look they check everything out

467
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:30,759
there's no kiddie porn there we leave

468
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:32,408
that night they move everything out and

469
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:34,600
we learned afterwards that this was a

470
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:36,299
group that was doing fraud in other

471
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,730
countries to be an Internet

472
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:43,389
once again our tunnel vision wasn't it

473
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:48,509
was able to see beyond the scourge of

474
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:50,799
child pornography 2014 and young woman

475
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:55,570
shows up at our headquarters not too far

476
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:59,580
from here asking for help because she is

477
00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:03,330
being cyber bullied by her ex-boyfriend

478
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:05,668
on Facebook she is met by a Generation X

479
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:09,490
which I considered to be one of them

480
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:11,049
okay investigator who looks nerv listens

481
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:14,500
to her complaint writes everything down

482
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:17,580
and says well why don't you just get off

483
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:20,139
of Facebook that'll solve your problem

484
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:23,490
we all know that that will not solve the

485
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:25,779
problem I'm apologizing to her and

486
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:27,940
working very closely with United States

487
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:31,059
authorities to be able to deal with the

488
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:34,120
individual who is living in Florida and

489
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:35,799
then finally in 2015 the Halifax

490
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,370
shopping center conspiracy to commit

491
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:42,250
mass murder what it was with three

492
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:47,860
column buyers one woman from the states

493
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:50,470
to local who wanted to shoot up Halifax

494
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:53,110
shopping center they had the guns they

495
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,879
had the means they had the plans the one

496
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:57,729
thing they wanted to do is they want to

497
00:25:54,879 --> 00:25:59,799
do one step better than the column

498
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,899
liners did they wanted to videotape

499
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:04,200
everything in high-definition and put

500
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:04,199
that up

501
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,190
I'll take a look what happened just a

502
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,620
few weeks ago in Christchurch New

503
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,059
Zealand I don't need to put it up in

504
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:18,639
high definition on the internet they did

505
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:21,668
it in real time needs to reserve out

506
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:25,360
samples from my own experience of how

507
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:30,039
complex things have become in the last

508
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:33,899
few years so a lot has changed in the

509
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:36,399
last two decades who finds what and how

510
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:39,309
our information-rich attention poor

511
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:41,500
society the issue is not that we go to

512
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:43,840
find info but that through social

513
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,019
engineering the information finds us

514
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,970
and influences us our personal data

515
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:53,730
today I would posit is number two in

516
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:57,899
terms of the things that companies want

517
00:26:53,730 --> 00:27:00,809
what they really want is our attention

518
00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:05,100
because everything that we do is

519
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:08,049
marketable and becoming a commodity

520
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,529
anything about you can and eventually

521
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:13,059
will be the subject of criminal interest

522
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:16,629
there's you know her literally submerged

523
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:19,200
by a lot of information something that

524
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:21,908
has value some of it doesn't

525
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:26,070
so it's today's society there's four

526
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:32,610
words you heard hookah before volatile

527
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:35,950
unpredictable complex and asymmetrical

528
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:37,570
volatile and symptomatic well I just

529
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:41,110
have to mention the likes of Trump

530
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:44,230
brexit Putin doTERRA tick who wants to

531
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:45,340
send our garbage back to us and those

532
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,980
are only example of some of the

533
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:50,500
extremism that we're seeing on the

534
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:53,799
political level unpredictable of

535
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:56,710
multipolar polar it has this extremism

536
00:27:53,799 --> 00:28:00,429
accentuates we see more division let me

537
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:01,779
see unless unity complex yes things are

538
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:04,179
getting more complex you folks know

539
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:07,210
better than anybody else and thanks in

540
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:10,360
part to technology one of the themes

541
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,590
I've heard by many people in the talks

542
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,789
yesterday and even this morning with

543
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,789
Travis was

544
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,330
perhaps perhaps not but one thing's for

545
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:23,830
sure there's a sex vacation that

546
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:28,840
technology will solve all of our

547
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:31,418
problems you know different asymmetrical

548
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,149
and uncertain life is asymmetrical

549
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:35,649
there's no balance and because the rise

550
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:38,049
of Technology and the complexity of

551
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:41,258
problems things are less certain than

552
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:42,999
ever before and a world that is complex

553
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:45,759
with Mary dangers that loom in the

554
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:47,999
future our short-term tendencies pose a

555
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,440
continual threat to our own well-being

556
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:53,950
and as our attention spans decreased

557
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:56,379
because of increase of information right

558
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:58,629
so we're constantly looking for

559
00:28:56,379 --> 00:29:00,219
certainty world of uncertainty that's

560
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:02,649
why some people gravitate towards

561
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:08,409
extremist ideologically based reviews

562
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:10,059
and that of course affects us so the top

563
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:14,649
four risks and policing there used to be

564
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:15,850
three in my mind and then we identified

565
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:17,320
another one we took some steps to deal

566
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:21,009
with that and I'll talk to you right now

567
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,450
first one is exhibits for those of you

568
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,840
who are local you know that we've had

569
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,809
issues

570
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:29,590
first off with our drug exhibits and now

571
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:31,029
with our regular exhibits and just let

572
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:33,279
you know there's not a police service

573
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:34,840
that I know that gets it right perfectly

574
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,639
the smaller police services yeah it's

575
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,769
really easy we got eight hundred total

576
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:41,139
employees for four hundred and fourteen

577
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:42,999
thousand people in the city and then

578
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:46,629
that doesn't include the RCMP in Halifax

579
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:49,239
district so a lot of exhibits twenty

580
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:50,799
thousand pieces of the exhibits we

581
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:52,600
haven't on drugs so we have a total of

582
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:58,299
over hundred thousands it is twenty

583
00:29:52,600 --> 00:30:01,600
thousand of those are CDs and DVDs can

584
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:03,789
you say clouds solution perhaps we're

585
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:08,498
working on that as well we also have a

586
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:10,570
significant number of DNA exhibits from

587
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:13,239
crimes that occurred upwards of thirty

588
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:16,658
years ago and they're on all these

589
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:18,730
fridges they stand up freezers that are

590
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:22,389
all alarmed just in case the fridge

591
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:26,889
breaks down so that's the first one the

592
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:29,109
second is prisoner care people are

593
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:29,649
usually in our care for maximum 48 hours

594
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:33,100
use

595
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:34,480
for 24 hours you'll see a Friday and

596
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,429
Saturday night and I've spent time in

597
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,750
our prisoner care facility where you get

598
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:41,710
young university students

599
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:46,030
we're totally pie-eyed on drugs alcohol

600
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:47,320
we were brought in to cool off it's our

601
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:50,440
responsibility to take care of them make

602
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:53,889
sure nothing bad happens and unfortunate

603
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,230
things do go wrong people will ask for

604
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:58,120
their own vomit

605
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:01,690
they'll bang their heads or they may be

606
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:06,669
assaulted by another prisoner source

607
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:08,800
handling we get information from various

608
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:11,170
people on various investigations and we

609
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,760
have to deal with that protecting their

610
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:15,580
identity is absolutely key so what

611
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:19,120
happened in the last year's we recognize

612
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:27,600
that cyber-enabled risk was a huge risk

613
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:31,449
for us this is our beautiful City Hall

614
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,879
you see you just go down Argyle Street

615
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,350
out here and you'll see it I guarantee

616
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,380
you even though there hasn't been much

617
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:43,120
Sun this week we do get Sun here on a

618
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:47,460
regular basis of that right the neat

619
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:50,250
thing about municipal democracy is that

620
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:53,320
unlike provincial and federal democracy

621
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:55,060
it's not partisan driven so you don't

622
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,730
have political parties at least for the

623
00:31:55,060 --> 00:32:00,820
most part across nova scotia and other

624
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:02,980
valleys across the country of course

625
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,679
that the eventual of the federal levels

626
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:09,820
is very different the federal level just

627
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:11,740
recently the recent government or the

628
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,050
the present government rather I came up

629
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:16,390
with their federal budget and the a

630
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:17,560
allocated an additional 22 million for

631
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:20,350
protecting children from sexual

632
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,820
exploitation online 151 million for a

633
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:24,399
better disaster enhancement preparation

634
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,260
response 144 million to protect Canada's

635
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,480
critical infrastructure from cyber

636
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,550
threats it sounds like a lot of money

637
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,600
it's going to be over several years but

638
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:36,220
is it really when you're talking about a

639
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,870
country of thirty four million people in

640
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,390
contrast to the federal budget which is

641
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:42,580
billions upon billions of dollars at the

642
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:43,120
municipal level a charkie's budget is

643
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,240
only nine

644
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,040
million dollars that's the fair amount

645
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,380
of chump change but 92 percent of that

646
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,240
is strictly for paying benefits and only

647
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,730
eight of that eight percent of that is

648
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,180
for what can be described as being

649
00:32:54,730 --> 00:33:01,360
discretionary spending discretion after

650
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:05,350
that during the last budget

651
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:08,679
deliberations at Halifax Hall in January

652
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:11,590
I had two councillors who voted against

653
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,990
the budget the 14 others voted for it

654
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,439
but to vote against it this is this is

655
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,830
key

656
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,600
in my mind one voted against it because

657
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:22,659
he uses being too much money as police

658
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,270
reported crime has been going down any

659
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,800
other because in his estimation we did

660
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:29,830
not have enough money for cybercrime

661
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:35,620
investigations and cybersecurity you

662
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:38,050
know what they're both correct here's a

663
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,760
changing face of Public Safety we've

664
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:43,540
seen tradition as you'll see up there

665
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,010
since 1992 about the number of police

666
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,570
reported crimes very important that you

667
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:48,340
keep that line police reported crimes

668
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:50,678
because not all crimes are reported

669
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,290
police in fact I'd have to say it's

670
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,850
about a minority upwards about thirty to

671
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:56,860
forty percent there's certain crimes

672
00:33:54,850 --> 00:34:01,510
such as sexual assault which are as low

673
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:03,729
as six seven percent so you can see the

674
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:07,840
pattern the red line has been going down

675
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:11,830
today but the costs of policing have

676
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,759
gone up and for many reasons biggest

677
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,009
most important reason is

678
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,500
accountabilities well that's a

679
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:19,450
discussion for another day see it expect

680
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,219
between those two lines that you have a

681
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:23,290
supposed crime reduction to get it and

682
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:28,779
that's what one of the counselors was

683
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:33,040
looking at but has crime truly gone down

684
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:36,159
as I said before indeed police reported

685
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,629
crime has gone down so let's do an

686
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,300
informal survey shall we if you don't

687
00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:46,389
mind and only if you feel comfortable to

688
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:47,919
participate in this if in the last year

689
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:50,700
you have been the victim of a

690
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:54,100
traditional crime please raise your hand

691
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:55,928
so traditional crime being theft of

692
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,170
something that you own

693
00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:04,170
talking about specific tangible items of

694
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:07,150
an assault something broken into a house

695
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:08,619
and usually and kinda see the lights but

696
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:12,880
I don't see that many hands and that's

697
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:13,960
normal because for the most part it's a

698
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,030
very small segment of the population

699
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:21,490
that's victimized by traditional crimes

700
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:25,839
so that being said let's ask another

701
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:29,379
question in the last year please raise

702
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:31,058
your hand if you've received offers of

703
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:36,220
money from overseas

704
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:38,559
if you received email spam or malware if

705
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,720
you've been harassed online and I

706
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,579
haven't okay if you've had your email

707
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,348
account hacked if your computer has been

708
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:46,119
compromised by a virus if your credit

709
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:48,730
card number has been stolen or portions

710
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:50,829
of your identity have been stolen okay

711
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:52,720
and I dare say it's about eighty to

712
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:54,940
ninety percent of this room if not a

713
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,660
hundred percent that has gone through

714
00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:01,540
that 2016 UK study by the RAND

715
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:04,750
Corporation had shown a 100 percent

716
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:06,490
increase in sales of illicit drugs over

717
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,510
the previous three years through the

718
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:10,720
dark web alone

719
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:12,460
another 2015 year before UK study

720
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,209
concluded that over fifty percent of all

721
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:17,109
victims of crime this is in 2015

722
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,510
resulted from technologically

723
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:21,819
facilitated activities ie the Internet

724
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:24,609
and social media it also demonstrated

725
00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:27,160
that ninety percent of large businesses

726
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:30,339
and 74% of small to medium enterprises

727
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:33,069
had some form of data breach which was

728
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:34,450
up from the 2014 statistics of eighty

729
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:38,920
one percent and sixty percent

730
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:41,500
respectively and so I ask you has crime

731
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:45,760
truly gone down or has it simply morphed

732
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:47,380
elsewhere so these are some of the

733
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,400
emergent realities of policing today and

734
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:53,920
I'm constant time you can read them up

735
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:57,250
there just want to raise a few points to

736
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,829
you one of the issues I've had to deal

737
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:02,200
with is a sheer volume of data collected

738
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:05,380
by our service and by police services

739
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:08,089
for that matter across the world that's

740
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:10,940
data that is not only our

741
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:13,910
but comes from buy more video dashcam

742
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:17,150
CCTVs phones and of course social media

743
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:19,069
as indicated before we have 100,000 more

744
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:24,490
than hundred thousand pieces of exhibits

745
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:24,490
alone 20,000 those being CDs and DVDs

746
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:29,090
what other types of technologies that

747
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:32,930
are available to police that would

748
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:35,150
provide data as well and we don't have

749
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:37,759
many of this analysis for various

750
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:39,890
reasons but there's unmanned aircraft

751
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,470
systems ie drones facial recognition

752
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:44,900
forensic video analysis body more video

753
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,950
automatic license plate readers the

754
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,820
whole issue around the internet of

755
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:53,569
things that are out there and our

756
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:55,760
biggest issues revolve around antiquated

757
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:58,150
legacy systems some of which are no

758
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,980
longer being maintained by the vendors

759
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:03,980
through regular software updates as well

760
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:07,100
as unsecured devices untested backups

761
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:09,680
and supported by antiquated business

762
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:12,140
continuity plans and these the challenge

763
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,859
that we have to deal with some other

764
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:19,040
emergency realities this whole issue

765
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:22,600
around lawful access should police

766
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,600
obtain information should they not

767
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:34,129
I studied Soviet studies today nobody

768
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:37,430
history essentially I went to the Soviet

769
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:40,340
Union on a study tour back in early 1984

770
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:43,819
and I remember it was around the 3rd of

771
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:46,690
January I'm standing in red square it's

772
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:53,300
evening it's crappy weather outside

773
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:56,270
Moscow ok in there light Sanders hundred

774
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:59,570
feet apart and under each light Center

775
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:02,270
there was a police officer and there was

776
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:05,020
a sign on each light standard to

777
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:09,650
celebrate the new year and the year was

778
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:11,060
1984 talk about being Orwellian and it

779
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:13,609
was at that point that I said I don't

780
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,910
want to live in a society where you got

781
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:18,240
police on every street

782
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:23,430
and that's under this guy to me my years

783
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:26,308
in policing there's a slow adaptation of

784
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:27,509
police HR models to accommodate emerging

785
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:28,950
technological needs and something

786
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:31,619
interesting you might read yesterday the

787
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:33,828
RCMP came out and said that they want to

788
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:37,829
start hiring accountants mathematicians

789
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:43,079
coders individuals who have experience

790
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:45,329
in online crimes without sending them

791
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:46,369
through the RCMP training academy in

792
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:50,250
Regina

793
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:53,309
basically have them investigate give

794
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:56,480
them training don't necessarily have to

795
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:59,549
give them a gun or peace officer status

796
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:03,150
which is something that is long overdue

797
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:05,940
in policing and then there's the issue

798
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:08,400
of remember talking about perceptions

799
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:10,740
persistent fears of terrorist threats

800
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:17,750
where technology used enhanced weapons

801
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:21,029
of mass disruption this discussion

802
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:23,250
something that you know but you may be

803
00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:27,930
in denial of and that's what we're all

804
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:29,700
going to die all of us said was that and

805
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:32,190
if we take a look at this room myself

806
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:35,819
and this group right from the middle on

807
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:39,900
over we're gonna die of the first part

808
00:40:35,819 --> 00:40:41,549
heart and circulatory disorders about

809
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:47,009
three table three rows of tables over

810
00:40:41,549 --> 00:40:49,650
here your folks are gonna die of is that

811
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:52,650
respirators worse yes

812
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:55,529
and then another row tables of cancers

813
00:40:52,650 --> 00:41:00,900
and the rest is up there where does

814
00:40:55,529 --> 00:41:05,329
terrorism lie in there it's a subset of

815
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:09,990
war you know how much money time effort

816
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:11,970
do we spend and policing and security on

817
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:15,229
the whole dish around terrorism let's

818
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:20,419
take a look at the numbers better there

819
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:20,420
this is from I think 2015

820
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:29,960
islamic jihaddists immigrants respond

821
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:34,730
suppose s and to individuals far

822
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:40,819
right-wing terrorists five armed

823
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:44,810
toddlers 21 stories mom has a gun in her

824
00:41:40,819 --> 00:41:47,300
bag she puts in the back seat right

825
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:49,819
beside junior who is strapped into a car

826
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:53,630
seat he reaches down picks it up shoots

827
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:57,200
the mother through the back that happens

828
00:41:53,630 --> 00:42:00,890
lawn mowers 69 it happened to us here in

829
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:05,660
Halifax two years ago individual was on

830
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:08,750
a ride on tractor he was on a cited Hill

831
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:12,049
lost control ended up rolling down and

832
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:15,400
killing him being hit by bus everything

833
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:18,380
there being shot by another American

834
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:22,220
opioids and other drug overdoses in the

835
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:25,099
US and 2016 killed between 56 and 60

836
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:28,879
thousand people gun this homicides

837
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:32,180
suicides accidents 36,000 and just

838
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,190
beneath that is car accidents 35,000

839
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,828
that's remain consistent or constant

840
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:43,970
ever since the US isn't tracking those

841
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:47,210
death since 1974 something that is

842
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:50,480
really at the forefront of public

843
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:55,819
discussion okay is the whole issue of

844
00:42:50,480 --> 00:43:02,109
next gen 9 1 1 who here thinks that they

845
00:42:55,819 --> 00:43:02,109
can send a text or video to 9-1-1

846
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:07,520
there's a lot of people out there in the

847
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:09,680
public you folks know better

848
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,270
there's long publicly think they can do

849
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,759
that there's only one place in North

850
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:16,369
America right now and that's in Fayette

851
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,829
County in Georgia they have real-time

852
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:22,160
text video and Jim Dedic routing of

853
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:24,700
calls in Canada series you see as

854
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,578
mandated that we go to the next

855
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:33,160
nine-one-one did he text capable by the

856
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:35,079
end of 2020 and only in 2024 beyond that

857
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:39,339
we be able to send images videos and

858
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:40,839
additional data and a lot of that has to

859
00:43:39,339 --> 00:43:42,970
do the legacy systems that are in place

860
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:46,029
and the amount I'm gonna take for us to

861
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:51,399
make the transition to an IP based multi

862
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:54,070
media capable system so lots of changes

863
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:57,910
as well in our society we have to deal

864
00:43:54,070 --> 00:44:03,220
with within policing and outside of

865
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:07,540
policing social media huge huge

866
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:10,540
challenges you see this and you've many

867
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:13,029
of us not all of us are involved in some

868
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:19,720
way or another people tend to mistake

869
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:21,490
empiricism for a flood of data and we

870
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:26,410
deal with those challenges on a regular

871
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:30,750
basis you folks know the key concepts in

872
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:33,460
cybersecurity many ports of that for us

873
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:37,060
the biggest challenge is that business

874
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:38,670
continuity lose a classic that we also

875
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,869
have to be a lot too

876
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:43,510
that's the whole issue around security

877
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:45,760
and privacy you know the seven of the

878
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:48,609
world's top 10 most valuable companies

879
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:51,630
by market capitalization our technology

880
00:44:48,609 --> 00:44:54,098
firms except for Apple and Microsoft

881
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:57,220
those other companies are all built on a

882
00:44:54,099 --> 00:45:01,770
foundation of tying data to human beings

883
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:01,770
that means that people's data is

884
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:10,240
people's data can be commodified as

885
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:12,940
Missoula has indicated and yet people

886
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:16,810
few people have truly changed their

887
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:19,599
online behavior are they that because

888
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:21,250
it's time-consuming even those people

889
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,680
know what it's like how often you change

890
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:27,550
your password how many passwords do you

891
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,890
have preparing for this look and I

892
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:30,460
counted all and I'm sure you get them

893
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:34,180
all

894
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:36,369
so that I have 57 different passwords

895
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:42,430
well are they really different yeah

896
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:44,680
we'll have to see that's today

897
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:47,098
you folks are well a lot well aware of

898
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,270
them my time is running short here

899
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:50,890
obviously with the federal election

900
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:53,560
looming right now there's the issue of

901
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:55,480
foreign meddling in our elections we had

902
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:58,049
a recent high-profile case several years

903
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:02,080
ago a young girl who committed suicide

904
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:03,730
and anonymous was involved in it we

905
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:07,540
ended up tracking anonymous to a server

906
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:11,230
in Russia and this is where we have to

907
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:15,339
be very aware of what one authors spoken

908
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:17,589
about as being cognitive warfare as that

909
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:20,290
it becomes richer information leaked

910
00:46:17,589 --> 00:46:24,279
recently used to influence our behavior

911
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:26,230
and what this states this well you folks

912
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,260
know this for apps in cybersecurity

913
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:31,750
poor sap awareness inside this criminal

914
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:34,089
market and for us specific to policing

915
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,950
is the cultural inertia police services

916
00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:39,220
and the justice system towards

917
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:45,368
technological changes homes for

918
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:47,618
addiction is both ingenuity gap the red

919
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:49,060
line talks about the complexity of the

920
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:52,359
problems that we have the blue line

921
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:55,359
talks about the our ability to answer

922
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:59,589
those those challenges and policing our

923
00:46:55,359 --> 00:47:02,230
biggest concern is going dark so just

924
00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:05,619
what are we doing maybe we're the five

925
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:07,240
eyes and this is oracle response so the

926
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:09,790
challenge is five eyes which is an

927
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:14,379
Anglophone conglomerate of Australia

928
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:16,630
Canada New Zealand United States okay

929
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:18,990
who worked together to deal with the

930
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:21,220
challenges that are out there they have

931
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:24,700
recognized that the single most

932
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:28,319
important priority is supporting the

933
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:28,319
encryption of terrorist messaging

934
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:39,790
obviously from the private sector you

935
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,920
have

936
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:44,890
initiatives that are out there now of

937
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,200
course not everybody can afford a cyber

938
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:49,569
tactical operation center which travels

939
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,560
from US cities a city simulating the

940
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,570
experience of fallen victim to

941
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,640
cyberattack of course

942
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:58,540
locally we're much more leverage than

943
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:02,470
that so I want to leave you with what we

944
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:05,290
need to do in policing we need to align

945
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:07,029
our strategy and funding as the one

946
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:09,490
councillor who voted against my budget

947
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:11,950
properly alluded to we need to attract

948
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:13,868
train and retain a cable wolf force with

949
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:16,990
a requisite technological acumen skills

950
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:20,140
and equipment and this is one thing that

951
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:22,209
we've done we decide to look at the

952
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:24,490
future that's why I introduced the

953
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:26,950
future early round with these young

954
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:28,419
people here recently started in the

955
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:29,589
Halifax Regional Police Foundation of

956
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:34,840
the United we'll be talking a bit about

957
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:37,570
that where we put money towards hacker

958
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:39,220
high school and proper eyeline hygiene

959
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:40,570
for young kids exposing them to the

960
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:43,180
possibility of working in the area

961
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:44,920
informatics we need to have the right

962
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:47,049
update an updatable technology

963
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,080
especially updatable technology we need

964
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:51,460
to leverage local national international

965
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:53,410
investigative capability and we need to

966
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,750
create agile operating models that allow

967
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:59,170
for police to operate effectively and

968
00:48:55,750 --> 00:49:00,940
especially legally and we need to have a

969
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,800
consistently updated legislative and

970
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:04,810
judicial structure a good example is the

971
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,600
Council of Europe Convention on

972
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:09,790
cybercrime cts 185 also known as the

973
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:12,400
Budapest convention that sets analyst

974
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:16,540
standards that signatory countries

975
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:18,040
including Canada adhere to and these are

976
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,810
significant challenges that need to be

977
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,520
overcome for us to be able to deal with

978
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:23,830
the challenges that we have before us

979
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:28,750
and especially of those unknown unknowns

980
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:31,090
that we really will have to do with my

981
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:32,530
take away nothing new you recognize we

982
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:36,250
all recognize the complexity that's out

983
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:39,330
there we have not adjusted to that

984
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:41,770
complexity policing or in the judiciary

985
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:45,700
and we need to have a larger more

986
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:49,720
strategic debate not looking for simple

987
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:52,149
solutions to complex issues but well

988
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:56,080
thought out and well financed

989
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:58,810
better there and so pants is the first

990
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,990
question I was on my first slide I can't

991
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:05,820

1026
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,309
yesterday he spoke about the unfortunate

1027
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:40,009
story which was actually an enlightening

1028
00:52:37,309 --> 00:52:44,569
story for him as well as for us being

1029
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:46,010
chased by a police officer and of course

1030
00:52:44,569 --> 00:52:48,140
you will appreciate myself as being a

1031
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,520
police officer you know I'm just

1032
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:52,400
thinking my god it's another generation

1033
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:54,380
another country but nonetheless it's it

1034
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,780
taints policing overall so I want to be

1035
00:52:54,380 --> 00:53:01,040
able to correct a wrong that was done at

1036
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:04,040
that time and instead of giving to the

1037
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:06,890
Clifford hit across the head I think it

1038
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,808
was with a rifle but I want to be able

1039
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:11,058
to present to him the challenge point

1040
00:53:08,809 --> 00:53:14,359
from Halifax Regional Police on behalf

1041
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:15,770
of the employees who are here as well as

1042
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:16,970

1043
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:19,940

1045
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:26,619
