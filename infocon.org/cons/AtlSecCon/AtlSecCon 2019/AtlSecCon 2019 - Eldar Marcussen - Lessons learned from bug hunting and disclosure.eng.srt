1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,740
okay I don't have a fax it's good to be

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:26,369
back I was actually here six years ago

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:28,769
security conference 2013 by camping or

4
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,140
what I have learned from doing bag

5
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,360
hunting for a long time and there's

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,250
really only two parts doesn't even talk

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,739
about bug hunting moving around a bit

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,840
about this brochure and we'll finish off

9
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:45,149
with a conclusion now about myself I'm a

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,420
former developer transition Minturn

11
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,489
pentester

12
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:53,399
full-time security researcher I'm in the

13
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:56,218
software labs of zenit labs which is

14
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,480
part of dark matter and we're hiring by

15
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,910
the way we're not on that spreadsheet

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,369
but if you go on a website there's about

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,369
70 roles including some here in Canada

18
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:27,049
on my own so with that out of the way

19
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:33,479
specifically when I say bike hunting I'm

20
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:38,280
really interested in bugs that results

21
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:43,829
in vulnerabilities so you know what is

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:47,399
it what I don't care for QA bugs

23
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:49,949
anything like that where do I look for

24
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,119
at least specifically for me it has to

25
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,610
be software but obviously

26
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,880
vulnerabilities can be found anywhere

27
00:01:52,610 --> 00:02:01,289
ranging from security locks airport

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:09,098
security IOT software hardware you know

29
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:10,959
crypto bullets yes absolutely everywhere

30
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:12,518
and basically every system has an

31
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,209
opportunity to have its security posture

32
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:15,209
strengthened

33
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,900
that'll vary depending on who you are

34
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:28,840
some people look at it on a challenge

35
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:34,719
some people to improve their some people

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:41,519
look at it to improve the security

37
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:41,519
posture of the software industry

38
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,980
everywhere

39
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:30,879
and you can apply that in different ways

40
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:33,370
and as such there really isn't a cookie

41
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:37,120
cutter approach so you can use tool to

42
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:40,569
find some vulnerabilities but I think

43
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,879
uniquely what you do is you start with

44
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:46,060
what you know and then you look for

45
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,099
problems in that space if you try to

46
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,739
look for vulnerabilities in a completely

47
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:52,869
different space you'll often be hindered

48
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:55,569
by the fact that you're learning the new

49
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:59,199
technology more so than actually funding

50
00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:01,418
vulnerabilities so let's say you just

51
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,590
learn okay I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna

52
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:04,590
look for some vulnerabilities

53
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:11,519
I generally always recommend with

54
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,519
reading the documentation

55
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,690
or even just straight up or examples

56
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,160
when I was here six years ago I was

57
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,669
talking about security problems in

58
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,250
payment gateways and universally across

59
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:43,289
all the payment gateways I was looking

60
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,010
at and presenting at the time they all

61
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,840
had the same design flaw which I assumed

62
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:51,150
came from copying a previous

63
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,479
implementation and it sort of eventually

64
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,549
spread and became the standard but that

65
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,560
was something that identified simply by

66
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,699
reading the documentation and he said

67
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,500
the sign flaw that you can't easily

68
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:06,539
patch out of existence so that's that's

69
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,639
a very good place to start and very

70
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:11,940
valuable and then you gotta learn to

71
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,289
recognize weakness patterns or you know

72
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,900
critically think about what you're

73
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:18,270
reading whether or not it makes sense

74
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,359
whether or not there are corner cases

75
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:27,109
that they didn't think of and once

76
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:40,080
you're done with that you actually test

77
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:41,940
the authentication rather than

78
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,300
authorization so you get privilege

79
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,099
escalation vulnerabilities and the other

80
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,240
thing that's nothing very important is

81
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:52,260
once you find something or you've had an

82
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,210
idea you sort of you read the

83
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,820
documentation but but what if that

84
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,580
assertion and the assumption that this

85
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:02,909
function you know always returns true

86
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:07,530
it's wrong you know it's very often good

87
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:17,880
to challenge challenge the status quo

88
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:20,729
you know be be curious assume that the

89
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,820
documentation is right and assume that

90
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:31,219
the the framework you're using is with

91
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:31,219
that flawless on its own now once you

92
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:37,339
consuming a large volume

93
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:40,289
nation and then you might not be too

94
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:42,239
specifically experienced with with a

95
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:43,919
large number of under ability classes

96
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:46,018
and Sarah I generally said there's a

97
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,149
couple of things you did to simplify it

98
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:51,029
and the first one is to start off

99
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:52,559
learning specific bag classes so you

100
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:54,058
might say well this week I'm gonna learn

101
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:55,889
SQL injection and this week I'm gonna

102
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:58,609
learn learn buffer on the flow so this

103
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:01,619
week I'm going to learn some other

104
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:03,659
vulnerability and you can hop on exploit

105
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:06,059
maybe you can find software that is

106
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:07,769
vulnerable to the class you want to you

107
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,269
want to learn you can download the

108
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:12,419
export you can download the vulnerable

109
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:14,939
application and then you can see what

110
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,489
they actually did but better yet you can

111
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:20,219
try to discover it yourself

112
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:22,198
so from installing blank piece of

113
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:24,269
software finding the vulnerability

114
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,759
writing your own exploit it's a very

115
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:28,499
good learning curve and then I generally

116
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,999
say that once you once you have one you

117
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:32,879
then build on it so you learn one by

118
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:38,599
class two three four five and expense

119
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:43,319
that reviewing software generally it's

120
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:46,110
focusing on specific abilities at the

121
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,489
time until you get familiar with the

122
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,669
software and at that point you can start

123
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:54,268
looking for for more things and it

124
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:56,339
certainly I generally never look for

125
00:07:54,269 --> 00:08:04,379
cross-site scripting because those

126
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:06,449
things just show up everywhere it's like

127
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:08,059
two or three years later you can still

128
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:12,709
come back to the same piece of software

129
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:12,709
and if you find something you you can

130
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:23,819
when you find one durability what you

131
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:28,349
want to do with it is you want to report

132
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:30,089
it so whether it's to the vendor or

133
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:32,338
whether or not you're going through some

134
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:35,639
like search that's kind of up to you but

135
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:38,759
I generally find that my my enthusiasm

136
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:41,339
for software vulnerability kind of

137
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:44,750
follows this curve here which is it's

138
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:44,750
kind of flat I've got an idea

139
00:08:49,650 --> 00:09:53,500
I usually find that you can leverage up

140
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:56,290
specific report writing wasn't my

141
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,510
favorite part of the job right advice is

142
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:28,650
usually easier and they're very short

143
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:28,650
and sweet so some of my declines and

144
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,520
nonlinear time scale in this problem

145
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:49,270
because essentially the first three

146
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:54,490
panels and then portion typically drags

147
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:56,319
on from one month to multiple years so

148
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,639
it actually looks very different in

149
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,910
reality than what you see here

150
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,769
and and of course one of the other

151
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,839
problems with the fact that the score

152
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:08,749
she drags on for so long is that as you

153
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,999
find vulnerabilities this doesn't scale

154
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:13,699
so I had a friend in Melbourne it just

155
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:18,049
tweeted the other day that he so far in

156
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:19,368
2019 he has gotten over 100 CDs and if

157
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:21,079
each one of those is to a different

158
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:23,889
vendor and each one of those drags on

159
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:26,719
for four years it's got a lot of time

160
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:46,910
messing emailing vendors and trying to

161
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:54,679
follow up getting a batch piece that

162
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:56,329
email chain anyway so when you are

163
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:58,639
reporting one ability there's a couple

164
00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:02,029
of things you should know the first one

165
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,679
is what do you report you gotta you know

166
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:11,629
write on the technical accurate

167
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:15,350
description section if your expert is

168
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:16,519
changing them altogether each problem

169
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,480
that needs to be addressed by the

170
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:40,819
developer needs to get us on specific so

171
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:42,829
you describe I generally don't try to

172
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:44,449
tell vendors how to fix the problems in

173
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:47,569
the software I might give you a

174
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:49,339
reference link but I generally leave it

175
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:52,128
up to them to choose how they're going

176
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:55,549
to mitigate the problem because a lot of

177
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:57,790
the time mitigations aren't just used

178
00:12:55,549 --> 00:13:00,860
perimeters queries or whatever the

179
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:03,769
security industry tend tend to repeat us

180
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:08,329
an anthro very often security problems

181
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:09,949
in in other ways as well now where we

182
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,949
have to report it that's the hardest

183
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:12,719
part

184
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,520
I'm like established vendors and

185
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,800
particularly in the later years where

186
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,860
we've done many programs it's gotten a

187
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,719
lot easier to explain order to work out

188
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:55,320
and where you need to just send this

189
00:13:21,720 --> 00:14:11,940
information they have no and yes a new

190
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:14,450
standard security security information a

191
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,890
lot of the big players they do have

192
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:23,400
notification pages they just not live

193
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:28,410
where you think that they would I gently

194
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:58,110
email support and they'll see see in

195
00:14:28,410 --> 00:15:00,630
abuse cities cities you can just go to

196
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:05,900
my online web form you fill in the

197
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,900
details you click Submit and you should

198
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:17,160
Google details and if you don't want to

199
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,920
do that

200
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,579
open wall has a web form we just take

201
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,579
your button and you

202
00:15:24,509 --> 00:16:03,910
any public which is where the researcher

203
00:15:55,239 --> 00:16:06,009
will find a vulnerability and be more in

204
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,118
detail later whether they sell it on the

205
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:10,029
black market or sell it to a private

206
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:13,839
expert acquisition program doesn't

207
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:27,309
matter doesn't get notified it's

208
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:51,910
unlikely disclosure is what we usually

209
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:52,689
there's a reward no that's the one that

210
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,839
we see the most

211
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:57,429
it's when a vendor gets an email from

212
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,329
security researcher there's a bit of

213
00:16:57,429 --> 00:17:04,648
back-and-forth

214
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:09,490
a patch gets produced public disclosure

215
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:13,958
bug track or released alongside the

216
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:17,189
software and then apply the patch which

217
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,949
is I guess the primary pin disclosure

218
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:24,490
full disclosure is typically when the

219
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:29,579
vendor gets notified when the research

220
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,579
makes public there's no

221
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:57,550
and then the last one which is pretty

222
00:17:37,630 --> 00:18:06,190
new it's a notional see specific this I

223
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:10,710
think people they're unhappy with the

224
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:13,710
current status quo to make money

225
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:17,620
all right now so much say I didn't see

226
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:24,160
responsible disclosure on that slide

227
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:27,330
I really dislike used to say but the

228
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,330
industry as a whole

229
00:18:41,550 --> 00:19:00,330
traditionally it was used by vendors to

230
00:18:44,890 --> 00:19:11,920
make sure public smack responsible

231
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:14,770
public responsibility you know well hey

232
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:20,410
Chico gets produced in the first place

233
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:22,210
which were prevented so that's that's

234
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:27,300
the reason why I dislike responsible the

235
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:32,140
second reason why dislike responsible is

236
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:43,810
no matter how you some users will always

237
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:45,799
be and so yeah you know we spoke with

238
00:19:43,810 --> 00:20:02,570
the vendor and

239
00:19:45,799 --> 00:20:59,720
no superiority using now the industry

240
00:20:02,570 --> 00:21:03,769
does I really think we should value to

241
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:26,059
the discussion to begin with there's a

242
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:31,779
mute button liberally engage the other

243
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:31,779
thing that I see is this installment I

244
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:48,730
think the truth is that what keeps you

245
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:48,730
secure is

246
00:22:16,540 --> 00:24:05,899
so very valuable for defenders

247
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:23,030
and again you might argue that there's a

248
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:37,820
link between proof of concept once it's

249
00:24:23,030 --> 00:26:09,560
a passion available the problem is or

250
00:24:37,820 --> 00:26:12,879
even MOOC and so between

251
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,879
the time between

252
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:18,840
the disclosure local vendors think that

253
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:23,340
you should delay that on one two weeks

254
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:36,928
or whatever to patch adoption unless you

255
00:26:23,340 --> 00:27:13,110
have very rapid automatic cashing we

256
00:26:36,929 --> 00:27:17,510
have no way of knowing what the last the

257
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:17,510
Scotia policy compliance as a problem

258
00:27:19,010 --> 00:28:21,860
being each if you find that the week I

259
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,860
think it's useful to wait for money days

260
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,330
again it's

261
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:36,809
but I think that we can we possibly need

262
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:39,799
to rethink the core the core problems

263
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:39,799
that we wanted

264
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:49,210
with the current disclosure so also

265
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:51,490
placed under this this is a OC guy I

266
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:56,680
know him I absolutely expected better

267
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:58,630
from him don't arrest security

268
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,330
researchers security researchers they're

269
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:04,330
trying to help the bad guys that I'm

270
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:06,189
going disclose that they exploited

271
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:09,490
saying you never get to yell at them

272
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,840
right so he's shelling any guy who's

273
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,460
trying to help and the other thing is

274
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,100
looting his he's not yelling in the

275
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:17,410
vendor so in this specific case it was a

276
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:20,639
vendor who had exposed all the customer

277
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:24,070
databases on the internet no credentials

278
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:28,030
cameras on the internet no credentials

279
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:30,490
this thing wasn't showdown and at this

280
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:32,830
point whether or not it's insured and

281
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:35,230
bad guys either months old and or they

282
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:37,419
they simply they scan for it themselves

283
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:45,850
the people who want to steal this data

284
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:47,140
and I've already stolen it and he's

285
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:53,800
yelling at the guy who's trying to help

286
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:57,870
the vendor teach the problem so yeah all

287
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,870
right some of my own personal stories

288
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:05,460
trying to speed this up a bit I'll

289
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:09,450
probably go over just you know all right

290
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,450
this is a non-scientific

291
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,120
75 most of the time going to deal with a

292
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,560
vendor they're very good

293
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:26,709
you know I send them an email all that

294
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:28,600
apply no hard feelings even if they're

295
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:30,900
never seen the vulnerability report

296
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,899
before

297
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:42,659
in the undefined section so I never got

298
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,660
to deal with we just

299
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,060
I've also done a number of different

300
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:00,490
disclosure methods I've gone through

301
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:02,600
search before

302
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:09,920
direct I've done full disclosure I've

303
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:12,490
done my man piece the one thing I'd say

304
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:15,380
about going through a search is usually

305
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:18,260
usually good as well they usually you

306
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,610
know help the one thing that I feel like

307
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,020
they do that is that they kind of just

308
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,939
shuffle e-mails back and forth and it

309
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,620
tends to add to your your volume of

310
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:27,170
email as opposed to dealing with the

311
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,879
vendor directly but if you are concerned

312
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:30,560
about you know I've been there turning

313
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,000
around and trying to sue you for finding

314
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,310
a vulnerability in the product which we

315
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,410
all know happens going through a search

316
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:42,560
can be a useful way of dealing with that

317
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:44,510
so in my experience disclosure tends to

318
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,159
pull in one other two streams one is I

319
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:47,330
contact the vendor si hey I got some

320
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,550
information how would you like to

321
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:51,139
receive it they respond

322
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:55,879
I send through the details we email back

323
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:58,670
and forth sometimes to patch but

324
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,320
sometimes they take forever or they

325
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:02,090
change them on say we're not going to

326
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,429
patch this whatever then the advisory

327
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:07,399
comes first and public pressure tends to

328
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:09,890
make them rethink and the patch becomes

329
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,330
second and the other the other one is

330
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,530
when you email the vendor email the

331
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:28,820
vendor email the vendor and you never

332
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:31,610
get a response just one of these two but

333
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,919
I will talk about some of the the banks

334
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:36,590
have been involved with that we're very

335
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:39,140
nonlinear or very non straightforward so

336
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:41,659
the cacti super link a place or a

337
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:45,250
network monitoring tool that a plugin

338
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,250
for dealing with links

339
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:55,730
in 2014 somebody published an exploit

340
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:58,010
that's SQL injection expert on Expo dB a

341
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:59,510
few months later I'm on a pen test I

342
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:01,940
come across the same software the same

343
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,860
plugin I independently find the SQL

344
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,299
injection and then when I get back to

345
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,250
the office next week and install the

346
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:08,990
software and I determine that it's

347
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:11,480
actually not just an SQL injection it's

348
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:13,850
a very trivial remote code execution so

349
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,529
I contact the vendor we can loss the

350
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:17,719
diets that deleted the website so I

351
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:19,250
wasn't able to recover it but the vendor

352
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,659
anyway they come back and they go yeah

353
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:25,880
it speaks to next week and I come back a

354
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:29,269
bit later to check and that's the end

355
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:33,580
it's not public and the download is

356
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:33,580
still serving the old vulnerable card

357
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:55,370
critics and then I give up an escalating

358
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:57,919
but I come back a bit later because the

359
00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:00,709
way I see it they've already had the

360
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,260
initial exploit expect to be for six

361
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:05,840
months and anyone who actually looked at

362
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:09,020
the source code would have typically

363
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,969
draw the same conclusion it's a remote

364
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:12,530
code execution this is very likely to be

365
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:14,480
exploited in the world but this states I

366
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,940
mean it's been public for six months so

367
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:24,589
release my exploit and I include my

368
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:26,589
proposal patch so that you know nothing

369
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:31,190
else they still serve the vulnerable

370
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:32,690
code and then I've kind of just given up

371
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:36,230
on it and I went back and I look through

372
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:41,379
the timeline before we giving this

373
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:45,949
presentation as it turns out in 2016

374
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:47,989
basically two years later they added the

375
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:51,949
the plug-in functionality into the core

376
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:54,709
of the application in github and then

377
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:57,529
six months after that they released the

378
00:34:54,710 --> 00:35:00,440
official version that not contained the

379
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:02,750
plug-in in the core but it's also its

380
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,359
it's not no longer vulnerable so that's

381
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:07,540
great that's almost three years after

382
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:11,509
the initial disclosure then I have a

383
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:15,279
patched version in the core but the

384
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:15,280
website has enough that it still shows

385
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,599
you know eventually a year or so after

386
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,819
this way they go on there after the

387
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:24,680
website indicate it's now in core blah

388
00:35:22,819 --> 00:35:26,960
blah blah the old download link is still

389
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,060
there it's still vulnerable if you run

390
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,819
the old version of the software or you

391
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:33,890
try to install the plugin over the top

392
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:38,599
of this you might end up still being

393
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:43,160
vulnerable so and they never disclosed

394
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:46,280
anything to their users into himself in

395
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:48,470
this they just incorporated it into the

396
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:52,250
core functionality and she quietly

397
00:35:48,470 --> 00:36:04,118
patched it so that was one experience I

398
00:35:52,250 --> 00:36:04,119
have a lot of these same thing run later

399
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,710
two weeks later somebody opens an issue

400
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:20,750
on the developer saying hi he said Billy

401
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:24,410
could you please patch this I run

402
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:44,920
yourself through and then nothing

403
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:55,430
happens random person the expert called

404
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:57,770
system function in PHP see the problem

405
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,970
is that they chose to call system with

406
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,200
it they could call pass-through where

407
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:04,549
they can do any number of other things

408
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:07,250
you can't just go patching on the basis

409
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,540
that if you just you know do this one

410
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:11,570
content change you wouldn't be

411
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:13,970
vulnerable because that's not understand

412
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:21,940
the problem here is a bunch of other

413
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:21,939
people also joined in on that eventually

414
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:30,380
this is a problem now you know who wants

415
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:33,500
to patch this apparently he doesn't

416
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:35,630
intend to patch it so he's asking the

417
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,720
community for I guess that's fair enough

418
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:42,980
but no one comes forward to submit a

419
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,839
patch so one year later you know this

420
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,850
thing has now been in publicly

421
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,400
exploitable for for two years they

422
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:52,069
firmly submits a patch and he closes the

423
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,440
issue and I remember looking at their

424
00:37:52,070 --> 00:38:03,080
past John this looks like the wrong

425
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:04,820
approach for solving this problem I'm

426
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,600
working on some material for for

427
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:12,530
training this would be I think a good

428
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:15,049
good use case to look at patching not

429
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:18,200
being done correctly so I come back to

430
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:20,060
look at it turns out the developer has

431
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,669
rebooted the code back to the original

432
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,840
vulnerable code presumably because he

433
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:26,330
made a mistake in the pattern of the

434
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,430
patching Brooke starting and it's still

435
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:30,830
there today he's still serving the

436
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:32,660
vulnerable code he still has no there's

437
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:35,060
no updates on its website there's

438
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:39,770
nothing you know he's closing issues on

439
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:42,980
the github I guess so this thing's been

440
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:45,530
yeah for for four years and anyone who

441
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,760
downloads this gets a free remote

442
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,920
understand to get a remote code

443
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:54,500
execution from the internet as soon as

444
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:56,810
they deploy that's great so those are my

445
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,520
stories I mean you know there's only

446
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:04,460
some of the story it's not every story

447
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:07,790
is bad but it also proves this notion

448
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:11,300
that vendors don't necessarily care to

449
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:13,040
fix the flaws in their product they

450
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,420
don't actually necessarily care about

451
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,580
the security of the users even though

452
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,720
they have a public statement about we

453
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,880
take security

454
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,790
that is not a very seriously blah blah

455
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:26,030
blah we repeat if I ever get breached

456
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:27,560
but deep down a lot of them they just

457
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,619
want to write their software or live

458
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:33,049
their life or you know do whatever so

459
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:35,090
let's look at some some of the very

460
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:36,830
famous cases hopefully you all know

461
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:40,940
these three that I'm going to go through

462
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:43,098
we get shell shock shell shock is it's a

463
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:46,280
very curious example this one followed

464
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:48,800
wouldn't you know people would have

465
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:53,630
called responsible disclosure for I call

466
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:55,240
coordinated disclosure in September the

467
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:58,930
initial

468
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:02,439
environment ability was reported and

469
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:06,680
then they decided on roughly a two week

470
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:10,630
patch cycle so 24th of September the

471
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:14,839
patch all the distributions

472
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:28,720
notifications that were already by the

473
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:30,970
patch released all very good but

474
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,399
unfortunately it was such a trivial

475
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:37,549
vulnerability to make a worm right next

476
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,859
work for that it would literally take

477
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:42,470
someone with skills five minutes to

478
00:40:39,859 --> 00:40:45,020
write a function and exploit and then

479
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:49,759
you depend on the entire internet to go

480
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:52,310
and apply the patches from there they're

481
00:40:49,760 --> 00:41:03,800
using and that's always going to fail

482
00:40:52,310 --> 00:41:07,330
because certainly at any given time also

483
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:09,890
that the patch was initially flawed and

484
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:23,180
there was in fact six other hundred

485
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:25,848
bilities and it took about a week and

486
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:29,230
then over the next month or so patches

487
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:29,230
do get applied and

488
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,610
scaring some use all sort of dice off

489
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:37,950
this is something that follows the stock

490
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:41,400
standard recommended disclosure

491
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:43,230
practices and you know we don't actually

492
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,670
know how many people got exploded across

493
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:48,000
the internet but it was a non-trivial

494
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:50,490
amount we don't know much target stone

495
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,660
etc and it just goes to show that you

496
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:55,500
can do this motion with the best

497
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:58,529
intention and recommended practices but

498
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,390
if the time it takes to write next foot

499
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:02,490
or reverse the patch it's less than it

500
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:03,589
takes to apply the patch you're in

501
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:06,709
trouble

502
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:10,500
alright the other famous one heartbeat

503
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:13,020
so in April in 2014

504
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,730
within two days of each other both

505
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:18,560
Google and codon on the condom reported

506
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:20,730
the same vulnerability they scheduled a

507
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:25,170
patch release back for about a week

508
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:26,910
later and what actually happened was two

509
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:28,380
days before then somebody decided to

510
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,120
make it press release saying that oh you

511
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,920
know serve honorably in open SSL but we

512
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:34,529
are patched and they're broke the

513
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:38,490
embargo there's also a lot of other

514
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:43,100
potential concerns about the embargo and

515
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:43,100
handling of this pre-release information

516
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:55,620
there's a lot of argument but the thing

517
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,680
that I think we can focus on again it's

518
00:42:55,620 --> 00:43:08,180
asana patching so at the time that this

519
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:11,990
bean burger broke in the seventh from CA

520
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:15,210
that are vulnerable oddly two days later

521
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:17,759
security did a scan of the internet they

522
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:24,990
found six hundred and fifteen thousand

523
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:27,540
servers they also found three hundred

524
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:30,859
thirty person that had happened enabled

525
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:34,050
but it didn't appear to be vulnerable

526
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:37,140
likely patched and on one hand I think

527
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:40,140
that's good within two days we have one

528
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:41,879
third of the the server codebase have

529
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,020
applied the patches I'd like to see that

530
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:47,610
heuerman

531
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:50,759
it's not a bad start however the CI son

532
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:52,320
of thing was significantly slower couple

533
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,610
of days later only thirty thousand of

534
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:57,150
the five hundred thousand certificates

535
00:43:53,610 --> 00:44:00,600
have been reissued a week after the

536
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:03,420
initial embargo brach there were press

537
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:08,330
releases with official breach reports of

538
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:11,130
companies getting again a month after

539
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:14,910
net craft does another press release as

540
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:17,450
it turns out 43% of the sea-ice have

541
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:17,450
been replaced

542
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:24,480
furthermore 7% of the had not renewed

543
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,960
their key

544
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,670
so the key potentially been stolen it's

545
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,770
still in use so you renew the

546
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:34,590
certificate but the attacker has the key

547
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:36,090
can still just at will decrypt your your

548
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:39,240
traffic or perform and in the middle

549
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:42,270
attacks against your website so very

550
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:44,609
poor practices there as well we moved on

551
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:48,330
to June at this point errata that's

552
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:54,570
another skin 309,000 so this stage the

553
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:56,279
bulk of servers have been patched we

554
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:58,770
don't really have clarity as to how

555
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,880
quickly those patches were were applied

556
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:10,980
but there's still there's still one

557
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:16,680
third now in January 2017 showdown did

558
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:20,450
another and they found that three years

559
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,450
after the almost three years after

560
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:27,210
disclosed 200-person or roughly 20% of

561
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:31,020
the initial silver base we're still

562
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:34,470
vulnerable so yeah this is a very high

563
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:36,420
profile vulnerability you'd hope that

564
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:39,118
patch adoption and remediation would

565
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:41,130
have been faster would have been you

566
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,869
know more widespread but here we are

567
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:46,740
three years later 20% is still

568
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:49,440
vulnerable and they would probably still

569
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:52,250
be vulnerable even if the embargo hadn't

570
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,050
hadn't broken and the

571
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:57,950
the disclosure and follow the intended

572
00:45:54,050 --> 00:46:00,290
in the intended path but its owner comes

573
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:02,390
back to this notion that you can't fix

574
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:04,910
vulnerabilities with discussion you have

575
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:06,529
to fix it with patch it similarly I'll

576
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:10,220
skip this one really quickly eternal

577
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:13,640
blue Busan / / 2016 Microsoft said

578
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:16,578
please turn off SMB version 1 following

579
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:20,710
bad luck then

580
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:24,829
in March in 2017 that you should have

581
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:27,920
okay blue month after that shun brokers

582
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:31,670
releases the export public a month after

583
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:35,329
that wanna cry 8 so at that stage you'd

584
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:38,180
had 2 months of the patch window sir

585
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:42,770
provides some air cap dates and you had

586
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:45,560
had six months of official advice and

587
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:46,790
turn off SMB version 1 you had if you'd

588
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,560
listened to the security industry you

589
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:52,339
would have been the ease of warning some

590
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,680
turning off SMB one and still what a

591
00:46:52,339 --> 00:46:59,690
crock hits courses

592
00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:03,049
billions of dollars in damage and at the

593
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:10,390
end of 2018 the estimate was still there

594
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:10,390
was millions of unpatched pieces yeah

595
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:20,869
he's a whole bunch of other stories with

596
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:33,970
vendors from promoters physically

597
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:40,450
attacking through dodgy patching through

598
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:40,450
things it's it's not it's not a problem

599
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:51,078
the conclusion it's not it's not hard to

600
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:53,589
find this you know funny things like

601
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:56,380
hard-coded credential and I devised this

602
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:59,740
failure to validate SSL Certificates

603
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,740
default credentials

604
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:05,580
you know week we password policies any

605
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:13,740
number of things like this it's pretty

606
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:18,690
easy to find you don't have to be that

607
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:20,850
is everyone durability every every

608
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:25,590
impact every vendor they're all

609
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:28,230
different you can sort of its this is

610
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:31,230
this is the wrong policy one policy

611
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:35,609
suits all right it's I really feel that

612
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:37,380
each one really should be evaluated and

613
00:48:35,609 --> 00:48:41,609
disclosed in accordance to its own

614
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:49,410
criticality Albanese law that's that's a

615
00:48:41,609 --> 00:48:59,790
pretty new thing but it pops up he gets

616
00:48:49,410 --> 00:49:01,410
hassled by people and it's been proposed

617
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:09,290
that we should have something officially

618
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:12,290
called Albany slaw acid bender your

619
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:14,580
allocated time for the structure is

620
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:16,950
directly inversely through the amount of

621
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:18,980
time your staff spends harassing

622
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:25,350
security researchers on the internet I

623
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:28,500
don't think we need I think we should

624
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:30,660
all do better I don't think that people

625
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:33,840
will stop harassing security researchers

626
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:35,759
even though I wish they would but people

627
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:38,130
who are in this industry I don't think

628
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:45,090
will make good informed decisions on

629
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:47,760
behalf but I think bigger than the

630
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:50,820
squash of debate we really need to work

631
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,859
on you know secure code development

632
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:54,330
whether you think that's shifting left

633
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:56,850
whether you think it's better frameworks

634
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:59,220
what do you think it's better tooling it

635
00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:00,690
doesn't matter we I understand that some

636
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:03,390
bugs will probably always still slip

637
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:05,520
through that's not a problem and that's

638
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:09,038
what we need to fix patching right

639
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:11,859
eventually you're gonna have to

640
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:14,979
for your product and you don't want to

641
00:50:11,859 --> 00:50:17,319
leave you use this and risk yeah you

642
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:21,968
really want the patch to be reliable

643
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:23,769
patch to come in quickly and yeah so

644
00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:28,390
that's it I know we're out of time

645
00:50:23,769 --> 00:50:30,459
so questions I have a bunch of middle

646
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:32,009
koala thinks if you catch me afterwards

647
00:50:30,459 --> 00:50:35,879
and you have a question I'll give you a

648
00:50:32,009 --> 00:50:35,880
little koala from Australia
