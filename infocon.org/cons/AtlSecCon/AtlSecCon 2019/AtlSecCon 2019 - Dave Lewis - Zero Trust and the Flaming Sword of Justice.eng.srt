1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,170
yeah cliff excellent Wow yeah no

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:12,990
pressure so first of all I want to say

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,519
thank you for having me here again I

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,619
really do appreciate the opportunity

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,270
come down here because well you see all

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,689
you fine folks and also visit my

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,710
relatives which is always fine what I'm

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,180
here to talk to you about today is

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,800
talking about zero trust which is

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,080
unfortunately become a bit of a muddy

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,000
buzzword so we're trying to shed a

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,320
little bit light on more of a same

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,340
approach to how we talk about these

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:41,370
things turns out these remotes work

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,780
better when you turn them on so for

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,010
those of you who may not know me a

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,899
little bit about myself

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,460
I haven't been doing information

19
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,370
security in one form or another for a

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,989
better part of 25 years and along that

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,550
line I've made my share of mistakes

22
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,559
which I'm sure you've heard me say

23
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,120
before but that just did all those

24
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:02,849
mistakes have been great learning

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:05,339
opportunities and me yesterday I have

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,770
made a lot of curious mistakes that have

27
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,130
be turned into good things for the most

28
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,600
part and along the way I've learned all

29
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,908
these stories that as I mentioned

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,830
previously these are stories that I can

31
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,030
use to give lessons for others that

32
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,350
hopefully won't make the same mistakes

33
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,180
or don't need to make the same mistakes

34
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,330
that I made

35
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:26,070
so I identify myself as a hacker and if

36
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,509
you go around the internet you find a

37
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,630
not a whole lot of people like that's

38
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,229
too much it's really interesting how the

39
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:37,770
internet sees us in some ways I am a

40
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:40,470
very proud Canadian and these days that

41
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,390
has a lot of cachet in most parts of the

42
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,890
world especially when you go to the

43
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,149
Nordic countries and they assume right

44
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:50,850
away that you're an American exactly so

45
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:56,780
case in point this tattoo on my arm here

46
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:59,939
I got this done last summer because and

47
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,840
this lady nicely dressed walks up to me

48
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,908
excuse me

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,909
[Music]

50
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:14,040
I never been so scared in my life what

51
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,069
would happen if I had answered it any

52
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,140
other way so being a big fan of security

53
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:20,488
multi-factor authentication and having

54
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,540
traveled the world they see all these

55
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:29,790
folks with Canadian flags go one step

56
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:31,620
further and that's why I got this and

57
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,929
I'd like to point out the folks that we

58
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,430
very much love our hockey as we go

59
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:40,069
around the world but you know these days

60
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,069
were more into golf too soon

61
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:46,080
but I do work for duo and I work their

62
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:48,060
capacities Advisory sisa which means I

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,620
get to play the role of C so without

64
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,030
having to worry about all the wonderful

65
00:02:49,620 --> 00:03:00,209
things that all you folks have to deal

66
00:02:51,030 --> 00:03:02,280
with of all the budgets dealing with my

67
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,900
prior job I basically for cliff lifted

68
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,000
it up move it over put it down and do

69
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,580
and then a few months later this

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,750
happened and at first I'll be honest I

71
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:18,540
had a lot of fear and trepidation

72
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:21,299
because but this is turned out to be

73
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,608
absolutely fantastic especially from the

74
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:25,680
dual perspective because things that we

75
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:27,510
did entirely have access to all of a

76
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,250
sudden the world is at our feet and this

77
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,530
is rather amazing in that regard because

78
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:40,470
it can help us to deliver better

79
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:42,989
security to our customers but we did

80
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,380
miss a really key marketing opportunity

81
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:49,470
with the duo Cisco amalgamation we could

82
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:56,970
have called it disco I think that would

83
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:58,769
be full credit to her so the whole goal

84
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:03,900
of what we do is our missions to protect

85
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:06,390
your mission we are working to

86
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,209
democratize security because you want to

87
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,828
make it as easy as possible I would say

88
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:19,280
by show of hands how many people here

89
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:19,280
tried PGP

90
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,969
so you have to use it and that's the

91
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,590
problem is there's too many folks out

92
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,660
there that are not security minded not

93
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,460
technically minded not physics

94
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,610
superstars like we have over here we

95
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,530
have common users that need to be able

96
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,540
to use security products that are going

97
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,520
to work for them effectively and that's

98
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,900
the key we need to do a better job of

99
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:45,359
this across the board so what is zero

100
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,409
trust you want to know what when things

101
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,380
have changed you want to be able to

102
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,360
continuously verifying you want to know

103
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,760
that you are all of your networks are

104
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,830
hostile not know you have to assume that

105
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,730
that is the one key piece of the puzzle

106
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:01,859
you have to and if you start there as

107
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:08,610
your baseline it gets easier to move

108
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:12,300
forward so using things that you've had

109
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:14,520
for the last 25 30 years better there

110
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,870
are too many times those implementations

111
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,599
and various companies in whatever

112
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,490
capacity that were not done in the

113
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,350
correct fashion one of my favorite

114
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,420
stories is though company I work for we

115
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,910
had seven different network monitoring

116
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:29,070
solutions installed and I started there

117
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,890
and I said why is this and that I was

118
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,930
told that each one of these individual

119
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,820
applications had a different feature so

120
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,260
I pulled all the marketing materials for

121
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,940
all seven of these as well as the

122
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,539
technical specs and found out that each

123
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:45,960
one of them did all the same things so

124
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,790
we really got ourselves into a hole so

125
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,739
we're paying 23 percent per annum

126
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:53,100
on maintenance on products that we

127
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,660
didn't and we have all these products

128
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,150
that over time we build up the security

129
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,770
debt and as we build the security debt

130
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,030
it compounds the problems because then

131
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,039
when something goes wrong it's going to

132
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,299
go really really wrong and we need to

133
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,990
make sure that we're ready for these

134
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,780
sort of things if you ask this entire

135
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,780
room what is love you're gonna get a

136
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:15,210
different answer and unfortunately

137
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,190
that's where the whole process seems to

138
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,140
be moving towards so we have to do a

139
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:22,920
better job of making sure we clarify the

140
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:25,169
message too many companies say this way

141
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,419
zero trust is by this box and you're

142
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:30,000
fine zero trust is there checkbox you're

143
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:32,000
good know is it something to aspire to

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,370
it is a way to do

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,600
be better and making sure that things

146
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,730
are going to go according to plan

147
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,550
because we know they're not going to

148
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,040
this is really how you should view the

149
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,390
internet at large and you have to

150
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,700
understand the threats are going to come

151
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:52,190
from places you really should expect but

152
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:55,520
you usually don't and as a security

153
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:57,050
practitioner we tend to have this as the

154
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,120
way we feel about things on a regular

155
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:03,620
basis or maybe that's just my recurring

156
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:08,870
nightmare is really interesting so back

157
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:26,780
in 2000 paper and really interesting the

158
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:28,100
whole concept we know that to being user

159
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:33,049
account management all of these

160
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:35,390
different pieces John Cato did a great

161
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,910
job in 2010 when he coined the term zero

162
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:42,469
trust because it put a marketing type

163
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:45,169
wrapper around this concept so many of

164
00:07:42,470 --> 00:08:33,169
us were like oh yeah we have been doing

165
00:07:45,169 --> 00:08:34,729
this it wasn't sexy this so the idea is

166
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,338
changing as we're going along we're

167
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:39,469
looking at all ways that things that we

168
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:40,820
didn't imagine 10 years ago a lot of

169
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:41,820
companies where you know this is our

170
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,460
perimeter this is

171
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,460
this is where our boxes are and you have

172
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,770
but that has changed so we have to

173
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,780
change as well the mobile device is

174
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,780
becoming a consumer device of choice I

175
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,949
phone for three days doing meetings

176
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,540
doing documents and everything until

177
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,030
they got that whole mess sorted out and

178
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:18,810
saved me from myself but the funny thing

179
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:20,010
was this is actually doable after a

180
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,089
couple of hours of getting used to the

181
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,780
pain and suffering of doing it

182
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:26,580
differently okay so more and more users

183
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,819
out there realizing this same sort of

184
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,770
thing and zero trust can be used to

185
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,140
enable that multi-cloud just as one of

186
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:39,120
those things so if you have your company

187
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:42,120
is using Gmail or as your outlook sorry

188
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,640
office 365 any of these products you can

189
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,710
use a dual access anyway as an example

190
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,390
there are others out there that will

191
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:53,490
marshal access to these particular

192
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:55,590
resources BYOD used to be that horrible

193
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,420
term that security folks would then spit

194
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,430
on the floor when they heard it it sound

195
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,650
very much achievable and breach

196
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,699
prevention this is one of those things

197
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,699
that drives me absolutely bonkers

198
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:09,710
because a lot of the breaches that we

199
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,710
find today we're imminently preventable

200
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:14,939
so with the beyond Corp as I was saying

201
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,350
this was their version of things and

202
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,510
they had their report card that they

203
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,300
came out and they talked about their

204
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,710
experiences in 2017 and all of this is

205
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,060
published all of these documents are

206
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,000
available so I highly suggest that you

207
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,040
go ahead and check them out for reading

208
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,420
so the traditional perimeter approach of

209
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,670
you know this is my moat this is my

210
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,459
walls this is my drawbridge that really

211
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:38,849
is the deprecated notion of a network

212
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,920
today nowadays zero trust is about

213
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,860
access decisions and where they're being

214
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,479
made we all love our triads so we look

215
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,700
at this particular triad we're talking

216
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,060
about your apps your devices and your

217
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,060
users

218
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,880
and when you're looking to build that

219
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,530
zero trust methodology you've got to

220
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,580
start with some of the fundamentals like

221
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,230
I was talking about earlier there are

222
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,680
some things that we have been doing for

223
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:03,720
years confirming user identities having

224
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,060
an accurate source of truth for users

225
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,860
one company I worked at many years ago

226
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,099
we did an assessment of all the user

227
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,110
accounts in our inventory one person on

228
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,410
that list had left the company 10 years

229
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:18,870
prayer and died five years prior his

230
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,650
account was still active and had been

231
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:24,000
accessed since he had left the company

232
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:26,280
these are the kind of things that are

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,660
avoidable in that case the perfect staff

234
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,060
had removes but where was the process

235
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,920
would have been good you want to be able

236
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,869
to gain visibility as a result of having

237
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,880
that inventory and looking at your

238
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,860
devices making sure that your devices

239
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,689
there's a uniform security across the

240
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,550
board I've worked in companies in the

241
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,230
past where a certain director needed

242
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,240
access to some site so he can download

243
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,910
pictures of kittens or something and it

244
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,760
was maddening because he refused to

245
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,949
listen to any of our advice to be fair

246
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,630
as a security practitioner at that time

247
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,330
we were very much of the mantra how do

248
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:59,370
we get to know that was an incredibly

249
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,260
bad idea back then and we didn't really

250
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,540
appreciate it nowadays were getting

251
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:07,020
closer to the idea of this is a bad idea

252
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,480
we can do a better job you can then and

253
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,220
enforce contextual policies on your

254
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,230
users once you have that uniform across

255
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,450
uniformity across the board and then you

256
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:18,060
can secure access to the applications if

257
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,500
you are whatever dot-com and your email

258
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,420
is mailed out whatever to come and you

259
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,770
only want your employees to access that

260
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,910
you can set that out through an access

261
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:29,280
gateway these are achievable today this

262
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,689
is one of the ultimate lessons that I

263
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,230
learned early on in my career is

264
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:36,930
castle's simply don't scale and this may

265
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,540
sound trite but that's the reality of it

266
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,489
is when you have an on-prem set up and

267
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,500
only a certain amount of bandwidth oh

268
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,150
it's okay we have disparate pipes going

269
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,130
to two different ISPs that just happened

270
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:49,199
to terminate in the same Colo hotel long

271
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,910
story been there done that these are the

272
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,050
things that we got to realize is we have

273
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,430
to make sure that when we're building

274
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,370
stuff we're building it in such a way to

275
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,650
scale and also just because you have

276
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,530
that moat you have that firewall that's

277
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:02,850
Kalman I'll talk about later today

278
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,660
you don't trust something simply because

279
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,060
in your

280
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,920
your firewall one organization I worked

281
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,650
at there was a great moment where I was

282
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,150
talking the CIO said it's okay we didn't

283
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,949
have net razón segmentation we didn't

284
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,780
have any sort of controls on our laptops

285
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:20,670
and desktops because it's okay we trust

286
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:22,709
everyone here a novel idea but that

287
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:25,319
really wasn't something that was gonna

288
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,700
be functional and we all like to be

289
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,690
environmentally friendly but one of the

290
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,390
things that we have to make sure that

291
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,710
we're not doing is recycling passwords

292
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,390
because when the attackers compromised a

293
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,430
site and then they're using those the

294
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:38,189
credentials to go against other sites

295
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:40,430
doing credential stuffing attacks this

296
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:43,680
is something that again is preventable

297
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:46,280
static passwords really have come and go

298
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,050
on as a useful way of doing things

299
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,180
because you walk up to the wall you say

300
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:54,449
this is this the password password one

301
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:57,089
and they'll say no go away then you go

302
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:59,490
back and say this password - no go away

303
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,840
and so on until you get in because it

304
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,200
doesn't confirm who you are it just

305
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,340
confirms you have the right magic word

306
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,990
and when we're talking about castles not

307
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,420
scaling in security paradigms that are

308
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:11,760
just horribly broken case in point

309
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,260
so before I ever got into this field I

310
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,870
actually did a degree in classical

311
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,939
studies and archaeology shock phase and

312
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:20,010
one of the interesting stories from that

313
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,530
time was this was the sack of Rome in

314
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,660
410 AD the Visigoths came they set up

315
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:32,819
shop around the entire city and cut off

316
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:36,150
all access in or out because they ran

317
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:39,900
out of supplies the Visigoths in 410 AD

318
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:42,209
showed that this style of defense was

319
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,069
horribly broken so why do we as

320
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:47,850
organizations still use this sort of

321
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:49,110
approach today being Canadians we like

322
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,000
to make fun of you know things like

323
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,170
going on hiking yo-you hoists it's

324
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,960
always good to be ahead of the Year

325
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:56,370
hiker behind you because bears but these

326
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,190
days there are bears literally

327
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,690
everywhere and last time I gave this

328
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,580
talk there just happened to be a Russian

329
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:06,900
military attache in the audience so that

330
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:08,490
was really funny you want to reduce the

331
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,410
risk this is the key piece of the puzzle

332
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:13,200
as you're going through and talking

333
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,089
about doing zero trust the idea here is

334
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,550
quite simply to reduce the risk that

335
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:22,510
your

336
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:24,969
your organization too because if we

337
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:27,670
don't do this sort of approach we end up

338
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:30,880
with this guy the flaming sword of

339
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:32,079
justice so back in the early 2000 I

340
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,780
worked at a company and there was a guy

341
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,410
there who his literal goal in life was

342
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,850
to get every single person fired for any

343
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,719
transgression whatsoever didn't matter

344
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,240
what it was

345
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,150
you know surfed to auto trader con CA

346
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,500
nope he's got to go

347
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:49,990
why oh because it's not business

348
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,630
relevant it was just it was absolutely

349
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:55,120
insane but this was that whole mantra of

350
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,710
how do we get to know and we as security

351
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,720
professionals have to do a better job of

352
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,700
enabling our organisations to do things

353
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,950
better faster in a safe and secure

354
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,990
fashion because I've been to a couple of

355
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:07,390
DevOps conferences recently and they are

356
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:09,880
going out of their way to say security

357
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:13,180
is not relevant and this is a problem

358
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:16,210
because they are running into these guys

359
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:19,599
and I understand why their headspace is

360
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:23,710
there this is something we can do better

361
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,630
at and if we don't get better things the

362
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:28,510
data breaches are gonna keep coming and

363
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,860
there's no shortage of these and now I'm

364
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,270
going to put a couple of slides up here

365
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,310
for a couple of data breaches and it's

366
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:35,079
not to cast aspersions on these but it's

367
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:38,260
just to show that this can literally

368
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,760
happen to anyone there are so many data

369
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,550
breaches out there that is absolutely

370
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,870
mind-boggling at this point in time so

371
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:46,689
from a couple of reports here from the

372
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:50,050
DV Dvir and IDC Research so in one case

373
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,970
here 81% of breaches that involve stolen

374
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,620
or weak credentials so sites that were

375
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:57,250
compromised and then credential stopping

376
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:59,860
attacks and then 70% of these were using

377
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,530
compromised devices that's a pretty

378
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:06,400
staggering amount of pretty staggering

379
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:08,649
number other and the perimeter is just

380
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,980
that the perimeter has melted away or

381
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:13,930
was never really there to start with

382
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,760
because another organization I worked at

383
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,740
it was really funny it's like okay we

384
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:23,619
have a firewall no problem you can't use

385
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:25,720
any sort of chat protocol so I was like

386
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:28,899
that and I tunneled it through port 80

387
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,150
and it worked he's like you can't

388
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:34,270
do that said why not said well there's a

389
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:36,040
firewall they said evidently and this is

390
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:39,580
one of those things it's just we have to

391
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:43,960
change our thinking we have to be

392
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:45,790
curious and the idea of the perimeter is

393
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,730
very much something that has to change

394
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:51,070
and this is one of the lines I love

395
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,720
stealing from my boss the perimeters

396
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,939
anywhere that an access decision is

397
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,760
being made I used to be of the opinion

398
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,550
that anywhere your data is I like this

399
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,640
definition far better is far more on

400
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:05,080
point

401
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,920
the new perimeter has changed

402
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,080
significantly

403
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,730
you have hyper Conner Millions remote

404
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,879
employees and so on and so forth the

405
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,260
force yeah so on and so forth and these

406
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,990
are the things that we have to take into

407
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,370
account when you're looking at zero

408
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,750
trust model you want to make sure you're

409
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,850
looking at all the users in your

410
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,770
environment you want to make sure you're

411
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,540
looking at the applications that you're

412
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,460
using and the devices in your

413
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,670
environment whether they're BYOD or at

414
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:35,860
corporate assets this slides a little

415
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:37,870
bit of our marketing just an example the

416
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:41,439
idea here is with a zero trust type of

417
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:44,290
model you are using this to access

418
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,910
resources whether you're at home in a

419
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:50,139
coffee shop or in the office

420
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:51,970
treating them all the same way and to be

421
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,710
fair I brought up a similar type of idea

422
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,690
in 2003 and one of the power companies I

423
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,060
was working at and I said he'll be great

424
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:01,540
idea we make Bastion hosts of all the

425
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:04,210
laptops desktops and servers I escaped

426
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,920
that meeting with my life just barely

427
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,390
because the team that would had to

428
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,410
support it was in the room at the time

429
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,930
and they didn't really care for that

430
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:14,800
idea but spring forward to 2019 and here

431
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:16,600
we are back in 2012 I started tracking

432
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,060
data breaches on my own website because

433
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,740
apparently I needed a hobby and it was

434
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,720
amazing as I went through the data here

435
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,430
one of the things that pops out here at

436
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,750
the time was LinkedIn with six and a

437
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:28,780
half million records in one of their

438
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:30,520
data breaches that sounds quaint by

439
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,170
today's standards where we have data

440
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,620
breaches in the order of magnitude of

441
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:37,030
billions of records and I know what I'm

442
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,320
talking about about how painful data

443
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,600
breaches are because I've lived through

444
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,100
one myself and one coming network that

445
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,480
this happened when I got into work

446
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,870
though

447
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,580
the next morning the phone was ringing

448
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,989
and there was CBC and various other

449
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,030
organizations when I have a chat with me

450
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:54,330
about this particular website and this

451
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:56,310
company we had this particular server

452
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:58,320
was supposed to be taken offline two

453
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,480
years two years sorry two weeks prior to

454
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,310
this and we were promised oh yes no

455
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,870
problem would be taken offline and I

456
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,460
couldn't get mad at the team that was

457
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:08,219
supposed to take it offline because that

458
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,780
was my error and my team's error we

459
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,000
didn't follow up with them to make sure

460
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,980
it was done this was something again

461
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,150
that was imminently avoidable it was a

462
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,090
mistake that I learned a very valuable

463
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:21,060
lesson from thankfully there was no real

464
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:24,659
harm done other than reputational damage

465
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,830
which ultimately we survived now if you

466
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,270
look at the cycle information is

467
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,530
beautiful botnet I absolutely loved

468
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,000
pulling these slides out over and over

469
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,680
again because this is a couple years ago

470
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,450
that's closer to three years ago now at

471
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,010
this point but you get the various types

472
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,380
of data breaches and based on their

473
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:43,980
magnitude and then you jump forward to

474
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:45,210
not too long ago exactly wow this is one

475
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,780
of the things that drives me nuts

476
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,460
a lot of this is avoidable so much the

477
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,680
data breaches are so bad that the site

478
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,480
information is beautiful net net had to

479
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,040
change the way they do things and this

480
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,210
is how their data breaches are presented

481
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:02,760
today they had to reject the way they

482
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:05,640
did things because of this problem so

483
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:11,730
why is this relevant well because

484
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:14,880
there's laws and there's lawsuits issues

485
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:17,460
but for here November 1st 2018 as at

486
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,550
that point you have to redo report data

487
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:23,790
breaches that are and I have to read

488
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:26,520
this because this is here we go

489
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:28,110
real risk of significant harm so you

490
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,150
have a data breach that can result in

491
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:32,370
real risk of significant harm to

492
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:35,040
individuals involved in that data breach

493
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:38,129
you have to report it by law neat thing

494
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:41,250
inhibitor that's not defined as to what

495
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,630
a real risk is bit of a problem but I'm

496
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,550
sure something that can be remedied in

497
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,130
time and as we're going through and

498
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:49,710
looking at all these things all these a

499
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:51,870
minimal things there's a theme you know

500
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,100
passwords are really something that is a

501
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,600
deprecated notion

502
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,820
making sure that our systems are

503
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,709
hardened or configured properly things

504
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,899
that we should have been doing for 25

505
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:03,270
plus years are now biting us in the

506
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,770
backside then you want to look around

507
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:10,020
the neighborhood and see what's going on

508
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:13,168
so like any good security person look

509
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:15,030
the show down this is how many ports are

510
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:18,150
currently open as of the last snapshot

511
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:20,700
showdown in Canada if I screw that down

512
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:22,320
a little bit this is Nova Scotia now

513
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,330
that's not to say that that there is

514
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,799
that many problems but you can be

515
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:32,000
guaranteed a subset of those are going

516
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:32,000
to have issues too soon

517
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,400
and as you're going through it you're

518
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,200
looking at the different things you're

519
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,240
seeing all these compromised databases

520
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,669
or SSH versions and all these sort of

521
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,260
things and then you see things like this

522
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:45,570
there were all kinds of webcams in

523
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,240
Canada and this one is in Nova Scotia so

524
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,678
I really am having trouble trying to

525
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,570
understand what's so important about

526
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,250
this particular garage door that they

527
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:56,460
needed a camera but I'm sure that's a

528
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:58,470
question for another day so we look at

529
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,419
all these things these low-hanging fruit

530
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,799
that can be easily fixed these passwords

531
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:03,600
that are being an issue all these

532
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:06,059
different pieces that we can be doing a

533
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,889
better job protecting and that brings us

534
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:11,039
up to a zero trust Network proposition

535
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:13,799
or as I prefer to call it a trusted

536
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:17,220
access visit proposition we wanted to

537
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:18,720
value the stolen credentials so for

538
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,280
example if your company is compromised

539
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,770
and all the credentials are dumped and

540
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,990
they're not posted on pastebin or github

541
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,299
or whatever it happens to be how do you

542
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:29,450
know that you've been popped if these

543
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:33,230
credentials are being used against you

544
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:35,340
some consideration low-hanging fruit

545
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:38,549
patches that could have been applied

546
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,760
that we're missed my favorite one of all

547
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:43,200
is in so many words in the past

548
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,549
Oracle patches they came in on a

549
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,010
quarterly release cycle

550
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:49,139
we're not applied for two years out and

551
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:51,990
usually the answer that I got from the

552
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:56,419
DBA was it's my database it's working

553
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:58,530
fine you want to confer mate in conflict

554
00:23:56,419 --> 00:24:00,360
complicate that lateral movement of the

555
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,710
attacker if in fact they are able to get

556
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,678
in your organization you don't want them

557
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:08,030
to be able to pivot through your network

558
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,030
why are we gonna make things easier

559
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:14,690
and of course I took my bastion host

560
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:17,110
conversation from earlier and put it but

561
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:19,370
this is what that would have been so

562
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:20,479
this is a really interesting thing is

563
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,639
when we're looking at all these hosts

564
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,830
and how we harden them it's amazing what

565
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:26,719
we do we will go out of our way to

566
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,299
harden the system that we put in the DMZ

567
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,830
and make sure it is locked down tight

568
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:33,710
and then systems on their back-end

569
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:37,668
processing have entire installs of

570
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,809
Microsoft Office on them why I asked the

571
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:40,370
support team does one particular

572
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:42,080
organization why we had done that and

573
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,080
they said because we had it and we had a

574
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:49,549
license for it and we thought why not

575
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:53,230
but they had so this method of doing

576
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:55,929
security is really not going to work so

577
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:58,879
discussion you have to set expectations

578
00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:00,590
not only with your own team but the

579
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:03,139
other parts of the organization that you

580
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:05,870
have to contend with procurement HR

581
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:08,209
finance all of these folks that you need

582
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:12,500
to communicate with in order to get this

583
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:13,909
ball moving you want to aspire to a zero

584
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,100
trust network because there's no zero

585
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:18,440
trust certification there's no checkbox

586
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,969
that say yeah I'm done it is something

587
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,740
that is a continually moving target

588
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:24,320
that's not to make it sound depressing

589
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:26,720
it's completely honest with you about it

590
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,230
you can get to that point but it's an

591
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,029
iterative process and as we're going

592
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:34,909
through and getting these incremental

593
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:37,429
wins be it an asset inventory or any

594
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:39,980
sort of management of your user accounts

595
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:43,330
you need to celebrate that internally as

596
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:47,169
a win because we're very very very good

597
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,168
professionals about beating ourselves

598
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:57,110
and what are your priorities when you're

599
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:58,610
getting started so I had a conversation

600
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,809
at a conference recently and there was a

601
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,299
few people there and I said okay well

602
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:04,100
where are you on the zero trust roadmap

603
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:06,139
they're like oh we're already zero trust

604
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,168
we're good to go I said okay cool what

605
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:11,658
kind of asset inventory yeah we don't

606
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:15,799
okay what kind of user management you

607
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:18,860
have we have eighty okay are the council

608
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:20,120
whole been checking them nope and so on

609
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,429
and so forth and I realize

610
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,709
that they had just decided that they

611
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:26,510
would say we were trust certified or not

612
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,700
certified doesn't exist well we were

613
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:32,410
zero trust but they haven't even done

614
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,410
any of the work to get to that point now

615
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:37,040
I said it before I'll say it again

616
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,480
because this merits repeating if your

617
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,710
site has been compromised and your

618
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,770
credentials are being used against

619
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:45,500
another site or against or against your

620
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:46,730
own site how do you know if you haven't

621
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,650
been alerted or you haven't been

622
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,940
checking or you have a very expensive

623
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:53,060
monitoring system that you haven't

624
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:55,220
looked at for six months how do you make

625
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:58,220
sure that the hygiene of your systems

626
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:02,150
that your employees are using are up to

627
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:04,760
snuff you want to make sure you verify

628
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:07,940
your users verify your devices and

629
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:13,580
protect every application that you have

630
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:16,520
to deal with there we go so again

631
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,899
repetition trusted users you want to

632
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,250
make sure you're only allowing folks

633
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,820
into your environment that are supposed

634
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,680
to be there

635
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,030
you don't want King Arthur showing I'm

636
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,090
saying you know I actually work here

637
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:28,670
because that's a problem stolen

638
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:30,379
credentials the attacker only needs to

639
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,880
have the username and password in these

640
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,290
days as we've seen from the data breach

641
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,010
data that was on information it's

642
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:38,420
beautiful is really plentiful but if you

643
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,340
have two-factor authentication or

644
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:42,200
multi-factor authentication all of a

645
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,939
sudden you have been taking a stick and

646
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:48,230
stuck in the spokes of the attackers

647
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:50,690
before they can get anywhere you want

648
00:27:48,230 --> 00:28:02,120
make sure you have trusted devices so if

649
00:27:50,690 --> 00:28:02,930
you're using the right device you want

650
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,120
to make sure that you're taking that

651
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:06,230
process and if you're doing a BYOD

652
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,889
approach you want to make sure that

653
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:12,200
they're shut it off in a separate group

654
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,460
because this is a great example of what

655
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,590
happens if your software is not

656
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,120
up-to-date now this is a screenshot from

657
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,379
one of our internal decks but this

658
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,209
actually happened to me when I was on

659
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,490
the road in Germany because I had not

660
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:28,550
been updating my iteration of Chrome and

661
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:30,380
I had this pop-up so this is an example

662
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,210
here where it says okay you have a

663
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,690
policy that says your software has to be

664
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,419
update

665
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:38,179
with say five days lead time in order to

666
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:39,529
from patch to application or whatever

667
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:44,239
happens to be absolutely configurable

668
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:52,960
this is a great example and this has in

669
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:52,960
the past with BYOD you can avoid that

670
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:06,320
too you want to be able to enforce a

671
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:07,789
policy on these BYOD visa devices so

672
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,809
they can come into the network you want

673
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,070
to make sure that they're having

674
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:13,070
updating software so if they have a

675
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:14,418
laptop that's running Windows ME you

676
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:16,668
don't want them in the network in any

677
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,349
way shape or form and this is a way that

678
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:20,690
you can enforce that they are at a

679
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:22,749
certain level of patch revision

680
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:28,220
depending on whatever it happens to be

681
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:29,570
based on your individual criteria you

682
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,840
want to make sure that every application

683
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:35,330
that you're accessing is the connections

684
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,728
are being marshaled so that you don't

685
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:39,139
have random people at a coffee shop in

686
00:29:37,729 --> 00:29:42,379
Romania they're connecting to your

687
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:44,779
systems that you don't and then you can

688
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:46,699
get granular with those policies you can

689
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:49,429
lock them right now saying you can't

690
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,139
access this or that if that's your

691
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:53,599
policy or if that's your requirement

692
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:55,428
that's just any of these types of things

693
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,529
that you look at for your environment

694
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:59,690
you want to make sure that you are doing

695
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:02,239
it to satisfy your needs and your

696
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:04,999
requirements as a vendor I'll happily

697
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:06,529
sell you stuff all day long but it

698
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:08,479
doesn't do me any good if you're not

699
00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:09,950
happy with what you're getting because

700
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:11,629
if it's not satisfying what you're

701
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:15,529
trying to achieve what's the point

702
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:17,109
really having been a defender myself for

703
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:20,239
twenty years I had my share of

704
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:22,908
interesting sales calls and I know what

705
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:25,340
you're up against so make sure that

706
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:27,349
you're a champion for yourself and make

707
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:29,178
sure that you're looking at your network

708
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:32,479
differently as to where the access

709
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:35,539
decisions are being made so zero trust

710
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:36,889
or fix that trusted access here's a

711
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:38,749
really easy shopping list to get you

712
00:30:36,889 --> 00:30:41,299
started make sure that you're building

713
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:44,690
out your asset inventory addressing your

714
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:45,430
user management device management having

715
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:48,220
a you

716
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:50,050
security policy across the board so you

717
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,940
don't have those random laptops that

718
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:53,409
have been off the network for two weeks

719
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,210
because they're off on vacation they're

720
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:58,000
running a highly vulnerable piece of

721
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:59,440
software something that is avoidable

722
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,750
this point because then you could block

723
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,240
them using the zero trust approach or

724
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,650
trust access one of the really cool

725
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,410
things that I always love to advocate on

726
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:11,530
that you can do yourselves is building

727
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:14,530
out defined repeatable processes these

728
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:17,020
are things that nobody ever wants to do

729
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:19,629
but get real value from once they're in

730
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,830
place so and one we're gonna need to

731
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,160
know was that and I love telling this

732
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,020
story

733
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,990
the CIO decided he was going to take the

734
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:28,300
entire year off no new projects period

735
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:30,970
only maintenance on current things and

736
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:34,659
we rolled out ITIL for the organization

737
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:36,310
over the course of a year at first we

738
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,860
all thought he had completely lost his

739
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:40,960
mind but once it was implemented once it

740
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:45,189
was running our rate of incidents

741
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:49,570
dropped 72% we could measure it that's

742
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:52,300
pretty significant processes and that's

743
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:53,649
something you can do yourselves and then

744
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,290
once you get beyond that you can start

745
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:59,260
looking at things like user user

746
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:00,250
behavior device behavior making sure

747
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,910
that you're implementing that or

748
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:05,170
segmentation I might know a company but

749
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,580
these are the things that are the

750
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,410
products that can fall out of things

751
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,480
like a zero trust approach when you have

752
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,820
that implemented and you can then start

753
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,580
reaping the benefits of the data that

754
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,860
you're then collecting now as you take

755
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,840
these low-hanging fruit away and you

756
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,760
make sure that security is implemented

757
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,010
in the same fashion across the board

758
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,110
then you realize the attackers have to

759
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:28,810
go somewhere else and then they're gonna

760
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:30,820
go after your api's and any sort of the

761
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,929
authentication flows and that's where we

762
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,240
have to make sure that we're paying

763
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:36,040
attention to as well one of my favorite

764
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,080
things with years ago my friend Robert

765
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,850
Hanson he started adding all these

766
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,399
people on Twitter to his account and

767
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:43,750
none of us had done that manually so he

768
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:56,520
just had this huge list of people that

769
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:56,520
were following him to learn

770
00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:01,940
making sure properly documented and

771
00:32:59,029 --> 00:33:03,379
secured because if you don't use hackers

772
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:06,590
we're going to come at you and do any

773
00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:09,168
sideways this here is an example of a

774
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:10,428
submarine cable map of all the internet

775
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:12,950
connections that are available out there

776
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:13,970
and this is just one example of the many

777
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,299
different ways

778
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,869
the attacker can look at you via coming

779
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,940
through

780
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:22,340
dial-up and mitre he comes from a

781
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,479
submarine cable going after a package

782
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,789
that you're incorporating into your

783
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:27,349
software by a third-party developer you

784
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:29,720
have to look at all these different

785
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:31,189
angles because the idea of the hacker

786
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,440
droppings erode and trying to get in

787
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:36,349
your network really is move beyond that

788
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,559
where they can just take the CEOs in

789
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:46,849
minute for lunch and get their password

790
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:48,200
either by y9m or brick so this is one of

791
00:33:46,849 --> 00:34:04,549
those things where you have to look at

792
00:33:48,200 --> 00:34:08,470
it and say security can be done 14

793
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:15,288
minutes later the phone rang again

794
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:17,750
network directory Oh because there were

795
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:20,359
default credentials on an access point

796
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:23,980
from a third-party vendor into our

797
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:27,589
network bitten by the static password

798
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:29,389
these are things that can go away now we

799
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:32,960
look at things like SSH this is a great

800
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:36,619
example people don't regularly patch

801
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,569
their association implementations this

802
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:44,119
is just one example from the sample that

803
00:34:38,569 --> 00:34:57,250
I had just one system in candidate so

804
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:57,250
how many people will be vulnerable and

805
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:10,049
that's why we have to make sure

806
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:12,150
the current one you want to encrypt all

807
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,500
the things there are so many times in

808
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,120
the past people they all encryption

809
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:19,740
takes up too much overhead we can't do

810
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:24,779
that all of these you can encrypt your

811
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:26,189
traffic at rest and in flight we can't

812
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,870
do it as it's being processed because

813
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,090
homomorphic encryption I haven't seen a

814
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:34,859
good implementation of it yet lots of

815
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:36,540
talk about it being out there but that

816
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,000
being said we can also do a better way

817
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:41,370
of doing passwords web often is

818
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,510
something that was ratified by w3c where

819
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:47,819
you can actually use password

820
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:54,320
authentication really cool and you can

821
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:59,970
have if you take nothing else away from

822
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:12,630
this is your homework go open standard

823
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:13,980
there is nothing this is I hope so let's

824
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,310
go back over this and do a little bit of

825
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,750
sorry assume your network is hostile you

826
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:21,029
want to settle should trust engine you

827
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:23,730
want to make sure that you are verifying

828
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:26,790
your users devices and applications you

829
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:28,860
need to reduce that surface threat why

830
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:31,110
do we have easy phone abilities out

831
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,270
there that can lead to stuff like people

832
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:34,800
iterating on the URL and getting all

833
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:37,830
this data they should never have had

834
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,830
access to in the first place you want to

835
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:45,620
continuously validate trust with verify

836
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:45,620
and test again and keep it simple

837
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,560
repetition is something I enjoy build

838
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:58,250
your asset inventory get a hold on your

839
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,299
user management what's on your network

840
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,070
there's been times in the past where I

841
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,960
would go ahead and do an assessment or

842
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:05,250
as part of the organization I say how

843
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:09,950
many windows servers are on the network

844
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:14,220
how many systems yet and we get a bunch

845
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:16,140
you need better answers from that you're

846
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,950
defined repeatable processes or things

847
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,950
that you can do

848
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,919
you're gonna help remove they run around

849
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:25,869
with your hair on fire and write down to

850
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,910
network zone segmentation there is no

851
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:29,650
reason that I should be able to sit at

852
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,848
my desk at a financial institution that

853
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,680
I may or may not have worked at in the

854
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,880
past and query the mainframe directly

855
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,980
and do all kinds of really horrible

856
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:40,540
things and no one have any logging

857
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:46,210
turn-on for that that shouldn't be able

858
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:48,819
to happen so back in 1962 MIT had a

859
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,920
system called CDSs and this was system

860
00:37:48,819 --> 00:37:52,300
for allowing access to supercomputing

861
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,460
resources where people can I think it

862
00:37:52,300 --> 00:38:05,849
was four hours per week they could use

863
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:08,290
it and to help Marshall that access and

864
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:15,849
what I understand this is actually the

865
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:21,460
first password implementation to the

866
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:23,440
punch this is something that was done to

867
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:27,220
in response to something as opposed to a

868
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,799
proactive measure passwords have their

869
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:33,490
life it's time for us to do something

870
00:38:29,799 --> 00:38:35,980
better as security practitioners we need

871
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:39,250
to not be the sort of flaming justice

872
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:41,589
and riding in and saying no there's a

873
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:43,480
better way to do it and that sort is

874
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:45,549
melting away because we are doing a

875
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,720
better job of communicating we're doing

876
00:38:45,549 --> 00:38:49,030
a better job of having these

877
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,859
conversations of having a curiosity

878
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:52,450
about what people are doing and trying

879
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:54,490
to internalize and understand what

880
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:56,859
they're trying to achieve there's no

881
00:38:54,490 --> 00:39:01,479
need for us to throw the Holy Hand Rock

882
00:38:56,859 --> 00:39:02,980
every time somebody goes that being said

883
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:13,150
I would like to thank you all for

884
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:15,220
listening and ever that you don't want
