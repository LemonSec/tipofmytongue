1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
I want to introduce somebody very

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,149
special you know I've been in this

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,799
industry now for 21 years and it's

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,540
people asked me why did you get in this

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,550
and the first responsible as well

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,870
21 years ago there wasn't much going on

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,550
and computers seem good but I got in and

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,230
I got into secured you and when I was

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,699
talking security 21 years ago I almost

10
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,170
got fired in first seven or eight years

11
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,789
of my career for talking security

12
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,990
because nobody want to hear about it and

13
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,220
I kept bringing it up bringing it up

14
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,198
bringing it up and it was delaying

15
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,729
projects and got pulled outside a few

16
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,689
times so finally I quit that job and

17
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,140
went somewhere else where they actually

18
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,149
like security but my point is one of the

19
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,230
key reasons I love security and I took

20
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,410
an interest in it there's a little book

21
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:44,538
now anybody here read the Cuckoo's egg

22
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:47,218
yeah yeah you read that one sir yeah

23
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:48,870
it's really interesting from my

24
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,980
perspective it lit a fire and I think

25
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,800
for most of the guys here a little fire

26
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,110
in us for in full suck and you know it's

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,599
I think it's the first really well

28
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,480
documented what I like to call forensic

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,010
examination of an incident and very well

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,930
documented and we're very lucky all the

31
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,309
way from Oakland California that have

32
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,439
the author of that book just an

33
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,850
all-around great guy who loves lemonade

34
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,158
so if you're gonna drink make sure it's

35
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,929
lemonade please join me in welcoming

36
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,930
Clifford scroll to the stage

37
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,320
[Applause]

38
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,100
[Music]

39
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:36,600
great Oh conference says here conference

40
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:40,440
badges are needed to gain it um I came

41
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,520
out here mostly to meet some people but

42
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:47,600
I got arm-twisting doing a talk um I

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,880
went up into my attic to dig up the

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,509
audio-visual things from my from the

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,789
talk that I gave at the NSA down down at

46
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,920
Fort

47
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:01,430
thirty years ago I won't found in my

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,440
attic my original view graphs those of

49
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:09,080
you who are over 50 years old probably

50
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:11,210
recognize these and I tried to find an

51
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,680
overhead projector here it turns out

52
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:17,450
there are none in Halifax and and the AV

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,270
crew informs me that there not only are

54
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,549
none to be found in Nova Scotia but

55
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,070
document cameras also have become

56
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:27,170
extinct as a result of the way I'll do

57
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,730
my talk since I'm allergic to PowerPoint

58
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:33,429
I simply hold these up and allow you to

59
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:36,470
see them and more or less read from them

60
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:38,390
and so the first slide is is just

61
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,030
gobbledygook saying I'm cliff Stoll and

62
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:46,730
you don't care about that the second one

63
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:50,390
here zoom in zoom please you'll notice

64
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:53,149
that it has about 30 or 40 or 50 logos

65
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,820
on it because Lawrence Berkeley labs you

66
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,750
story came from used to have a rule that

67
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:01,730
said every slide every view graph every

68
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,350
PowerPoint has to have a logo on it so I

69
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:10,120
figured on the average you've now seen a

70
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:13,100
logo the next thing worth mentioning

71
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:18,050
it's wonderful to have these heads

72
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:19,730
because they reach the next thing is to

73
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:23,540
just say thank you to a bunch of people

74
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:30,829
all of whom are right here let's see is

75
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:35,290
this visible to you nope good thank you

76
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:38,239
to all the people listed people like

77
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,010
Eric Beale saved Cleveland Gil Johnson

78
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,739
these were people that I worked with in

79
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:46,190
the mid 1980s several of whom were

80
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:48,250
heavy-duty UNIX jocks and taught me

81
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:57,290
everything I don't know today about

82
00:03:48,250 --> 00:04:00,230
about UNIX and and these yes-no then

83
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,420
people who did all of the work I'm here

84
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,760
just a sort of claim credit for it which

85
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:08,390
is a standard way of working in

86
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,220
in computing namely make sure credit

87
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:22,969
belongs to you and blame belongs to

88
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:28,880
somebody else so I'm there go back to go

89
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:32,840
back to the mid-1980s there's a few gray

90
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,909
beards here probably most of you weren't

91
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,880
around then but those of you who

92
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:40,880
remember in the mid 1980s computer

93
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,620
security didn't exist at the time I was

94
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,139
an astronomer working at Lawrence

95
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:49,430
Berkeley labs managing a bunch of UNIX

96
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:52,070
workstations and trying to keep trying

97
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,780
to design some off axes hyperboloids to

98
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,690
build into the Keck 10-meter telescope

99
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,969
that's having a brief time doing

100
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:03,530
numerical analysis when the grant ran

101
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:09,530
out and I sort of had to go downstair go

102
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:12,469
downstairs yeah oh cool you don't want

103
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,580
to hear about how I had to go down you

104
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,470
don't want to know how I was an

105
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,900
astronomer trying to figure out how to

106
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,910
design telescopes and the grant ran out

107
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,440
and you'll find a job working at the

108
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,410
computer center because I was a physics

109
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,200
jock and there were no such things as

110
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:31,810
computer jocks at the time so I changed

111
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,810
hats and on the first Oh

112
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:57,370
it says oh you can almost read it it

113
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,380
says what do you do when you find it

114
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,080
intruder remember this is a talk I gave

115
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,580
at the NSA and they they said oh this is

116
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,690
will do would you talk about what

117
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,740
happens when somebody breaks into your

118
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:09,969
computer and so I'm worried about what

119
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:15,910
are you doing somebody's breaking into

120
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:19,660
your computer well obvious things you

121
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:21,790
disable his access you cork up whatever

122
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,910
computer security holes you have you

123
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:27,100
tell your systems users about it but you

124
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:29,470
don't publicize it you keep your mouth

125
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:33,370
shut you don't tell people about it so I

126
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:37,210
figure okay these are obvious rules for

127
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:41,100
how to how to handle a computer security

128
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:46,539
incident this is the 1986 version of

129
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:53,350
system response however nobody taught me

130
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:55,900
that in physics so so when I find

131
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,720
somebody breaking in my system I'll let

132
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:09,849
the bastard in I

133
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:13,630
I let the guy in rape I keep the whole

134
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:16,450
wide open but I want to monitor

135
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:18,640
everything I want to see all the traffic

136
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:21,969
coming in I want to see all the traffic

137
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:26,409
going out I want to I want to know

138
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:30,010
what's happening here look at that while

139
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:34,930
I'm telling them what it says um I want

140
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:40,590
a not even visible you have a cell phone

141
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:44,410
put the flashlight on that I want to I

142
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:48,580
want to monitor all the traffic coming

143
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:50,820
in all the traffic going out meanwhile I

144
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:55,289
want to make noise

145
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:58,950
I want to tell people about this I want

146
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:03,120
to tell the right people which in 1986 I

147
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:09,360
thought included the NSA 30-some years

148
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:14,060
later it means you in my opinion central

149
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:17,520
to doing good computer security is

150
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,560
telling people what's going on what have

151
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,159
you discovered what have you come up

152
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,440
with

153
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:30,600
and today 3035 years later the same

154
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:33,809
thing is true however the field hasn't

155
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:41,330
at best evolved it at worst become

156
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:41,329
rather more interesting so with that

157
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:57,689
cool why don't I just put these over

158
00:08:46,160 --> 00:09:02,430
there you know what happens may I ask

159
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:06,720
you to throw my slides wonderful

160
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,800
wonderful look at this this is you'll

161
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,560
have to put a piece of white paper

162
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:19,949
behind it because the professional

163
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:23,060
camera person just happily the

164
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,060
microphone doesn't work either

165
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:35,200
yes nope um what what's cool about this

166
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,060
is it reminds me of what to say yet it

167
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,670
isn't really PowerPoint but it's sort of

168
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,459
it's poor man's PowerPoint from from way

169
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:45,360
back long ago when you don't understand

170
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:48,130
something when you can't figure it out

171
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,690
do the kind of research that you learned

172
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:55,240
in freshman physics do the kind of

173
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:57,160
research namely you apply what few

174
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:02,080
physical principles you can figure out

175
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,910
you you think heard about you know that

176
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,810
there's a connection from someplace to

177
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,380
someplace else

178
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:10,869
you know that within your CPU there has

179
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:14,620
to be a link from whatever malware is

180
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,410
happening to an outside source you keep

181
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:20,940
a notebook one of the things that

182
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:24,579
astonishes me about about the nature of

183
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:27,840
of computing is how nobody writes

184
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:31,840
anything down everyone will keep

185
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:34,330
enormous lee elaborate logs and will

186
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,350
save it will analyze it with Splunk will

187
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:41,500
go through and feed it through Wireshark

188
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:43,630
but amazingly hardly anyone writes

189
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:48,910
things down in handwriting in a notebook

190
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:53,410
I was brought up in physics you go to

191
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:55,750
the observatory and you go to the

192
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:59,740
observatory and if you make an

193
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:02,170
observation next morning it had better

194
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,880
be in your notebook cuz of it ain't it

195
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,939
didn't happen you're gonna have to go

196
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:11,050
back and do it again so write things

197
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:14,680
down what else is there another thing

198
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:16,240
that I well I I need to see my notes or

199
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:22,510
else I'll start talking about other

200
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:26,470
things ah no no no go back a slide yeah

201
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:29,470
oh yeah keep a notebook do your own

202
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:32,460
homework what do I mean by do your own

203
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:36,160
homework this is basic physics people

204
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:38,230
don't let somebody else have the fun of

205
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,819
doing your

206
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:44,690
if there's anything that I can say it's

207
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:47,420
this that going through your logs going

208
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,220
through your going through your system

209
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,000
and understanding your local area

210
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,370
network is a joy and a gas because

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,040
that's who we are we're computer jocks

212
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:00,650
trying to figure out an enormous lee

213
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,900
elaborate system it's and and trying to

214
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:05,959
find what might what mouse or what rats

215
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:09,530
are hidden in this mess of ether that we

216
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,750
have in our back or back rows find new

217
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:15,230
methodologies compiled statistics trust

218
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:18,520
only yeah trust only what you can prove

219
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:21,140
you'll have lots of you'll have lots of

220
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,970
worries and you'll say I think it's this

221
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,670
but trust only what the chain of

222
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:31,250
evidence says you can do publish your

223
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:34,490
results to me if if you don't write it

224
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:38,060
down it didn't happen if you don't

225
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:40,730
publish it if you don't if you don't get

226
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,430
up and give a talk about it it's gonna

227
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:47,570
happen again but it's gonna happen to

228
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:49,880
somebody else speak out on the troubles

229
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,440
that you have you'll be astonished that

230
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,530
people come up to you and said boy you

231
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,200
know I had the same troubles finally

232
00:12:54,530 --> 00:13:01,280
don't give up everyone will tell you to

233
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,490
stop doing this hey we've got we're in

234
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,980
crunch time we can't let you do this

235
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:16,130
don't give up what's next do I have

236
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:20,300
another slide coming up yes No Oh on the

237
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:23,470
subject of publishing I published paper

238
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,430
in the communications of the ACM the

239
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,880
Association for computer machinery

240
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:32,300
called stalking the wily hacker in April

241
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,439
1987 about how I caught a hacker and I

242
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,780
thought that would be the end of it I

243
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,060
figured oh after I write this Oh I

244
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,959
published I can go back to doing physics

245
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:44,390
Yeah right

246
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:46,730
um um I then wrote a funny short book

247
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,199
called the Cuckoo's egg and I thought oh

248
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,880
I don't have to worry about this anymore

249
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,890
I can go back to doing physics in

250
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,280
astronomy

251
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:59,140
not likely go to the next go to next

252
00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:06,189
slide and see what's there Oh was it

253
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:08,439
safe zoom in I can't read it what

254
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:12,040
happened - what happened - I'll just go

255
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,750
back and read it gang I'm sorry overhead

256
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:19,270
projectors they're obsolete and so is

257
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:22,900
everything that I know oh yeah yeah we

258
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:25,449
did all of this on zero budget you know

259
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:28,870
we had one quarter of a full-time

260
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:33,520
equivalent one quarter of an FTE to do

261
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:38,320
all computer security you know um our

262
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:43,199
total budget in 1986 for all of computer

263
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,460
security was zero dollars put into

264
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,640
taking into account inflation today

265
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:53,920
that's equal to zero million dollars so

266
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:56,560
I mean I'd rather be doing you know I'd

267
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:01,180
rather be doing physics beyond that I

268
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:03,369
have no expertise I have no experience

269
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:06,699
I can't publicize this I can't there

270
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:09,760
were no online web blogs to publicize

271
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:13,390
this and I don't want to tip my hand

272
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,760
anyway finally I have no mandate nobody

273
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:17,920
said look cliff it's your job to track

274
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,270
down this guy you gotta you gotta catch

275
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:25,030
this guy quite the opposite people said

276
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,329
including my boss cut this out go and do

277
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:30,010
the work that you're supposed to do and

278
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,450
my feeling was the work I'm supposed to

279
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,750
do is exactly this there was a

280
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:39,280
one-to-one on to mapping as he's saying

281
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:41,770
math but and our funding agency said if

282
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:45,550
you can if you allow this to become

283
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:47,500
known will cut your Congress will cut

284
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:54,449
your money will double that amount and

285
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:54,450
cut it from your budget so so what

286
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:05,709
what do you do what do you do when

287
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:10,810
you're broke when you're stupid and when

288
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:13,360
you're discouraged what you do is you

289
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:15,699
come up with very primitive tools you

290
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,670
use a screwdriver as a chisel and a

291
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,530
crescent wrench as a hammer you come up

292
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,870
with cheap methodologies because there's

293
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:25,510
nothing else you're broke and you come

294
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:29,110
up with some creative solutions my point

295
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:32,740
here is not oh this is what I did a long

296
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:37,330
time ago no this is what all of us can

297
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:39,700
and should be doing because the amount

298
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:43,420
of smartness I had when I detected this

299
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:48,910
guy breaking into our system is was zero

300
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:50,410
so where should I go from here um is

301
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:56,410
there another slide after this er is at

302
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:58,680
the end of the talk um shine your

303
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:01,480
flashlight on that for a minute and I

304
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:06,750
really can't see what I'm doing them if

305
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:09,339
I let that happen I'll be well maybe

306
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:20,650
anyway let me just tell me what happened

307
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:26,938
so it's oh the middle of 90 what

308
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:30,270
happened in 1986 August I had left the

309
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:34,420
telescope project to work down into the

310
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:37,150
downstairs at the computer system we had

311
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,520
a bunch of UNIX workstations built by

312
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:43,300
Sun a bunch of accidie MS systems built

313
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:47,190
by digital equipment couple and the

314
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:49,629
usual assortment Milosh of win of

315
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,550
Microsoft and Apple computers spread

316
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,460
around it was in the early days of

317
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:56,290
Ethernet and we had this thing called a

318
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:00,670
Cisco router which we're all trying to

319
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:02,220
figure out how does it work one day Erik

320
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,020
Beals one of the

321
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,690
real computer jocks that I was working

322
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,820
with comes up to me and it's like my

323
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:13,380
second day in the job guy comes up to me

324
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:15,899
and says hey cliff we've got a computer

325
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:20,880
accounting problem the accounts for the

326
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:25,920
system just died and figured out the way

327
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:28,590
we the way it was built was we had a we

328
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,360
had a an accounting system we hired a

329
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:32,129
freshman at the University of

330
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:37,080
california-berkeley we hired this

331
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:38,760
freshman to come over and build an

332
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,669
accounting system so that every time

333
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,070
somebody would every time somebody was

334
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:47,120
on our system we charge of nickel and

335
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:49,649
dimes we just did a little bit of money

336
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,479
um depending upon how much time they

337
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,950
used and then funnel it off and pay you

338
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,429
pad or wallets with it

339
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:58,050
our idea was just just pay for the

340
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:02,250
computing time they used the network

341
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:04,919
time and Sun and so every entry in the

342
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,780
Etsy password file in every one of our

343
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,800
systems would be mirrored into the

344
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:12,210
accounting and one day the the

345
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,040
accounting program was dead in the water

346
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:20,190
which meant that we were losing money

347
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:22,170
and not much but one day Erik Beals

348
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:25,770
comes by and says cliff the accounting

349
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:28,679
is off by about Oh 75 cents 85 cents the

350
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:30,750
it's just not working later so I looked

351
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:34,790
at it and spent an afternoon playing

352
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,790
with it and they found oh yeah there's a

353
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:45,870
you don't have to you can turn your

354
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:48,660
flashlight off if you want so I figured

355
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:50,639
hey look this is a worthwhile thing to

356
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,010
investigate you know why is the

357
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,360
accounting program broken and so I

358
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:58,200
started looking at it turned out that

359
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:01,199
there was a user who had an entry in the

360
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:04,640
etsy pin the password file of one of the

361
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,559
UNIX boxes that didn't have a mirrored

362
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,340
entry in the accounting program saying

363
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,889
this is weird

364
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,500
I started looking carefully at that and

365
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,440
realized that somebody was using our

366
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,990
system

367
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,810
to the tune of several minutes maybe 20

368
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:21,890
minutes to half an hour a date and

369
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:23,179
getting away with it without being

370
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,670
charged and I'm thinking how is that

371
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,490
possible and yeah and so one day I go

372
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:30,290
off and I'm often some astronomy seminar

373
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,960
being bored and you know you're sitting

374
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,430
there in a boring astronomy seminar I'm

375
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,940
thinking how is that possible it occurs

376
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:40,910
to me in order to add a user to the

377
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,500
password file somebody has to be route

378
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,440
somebody has to have system manager

379
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:49,700
privileges and I start thinking about it

380
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:54,830
and I say whoa this is interesting this

381
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:58,700
is this is weird and producer should I

382
00:20:54,830 --> 00:21:03,129
be on the stage rather than here does

383
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,130
anybody care no okay

384
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:16,580
don't trust that one okay this one

385
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:18,880
either so so I start following this and

386
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,530
I'm wondering how do you how do you

387
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,010
figure out what's going on so I went

388
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:30,200
over to the password file I've saved

389
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:33,020
looks good to me there's and it was a

390
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,640
Friday morning when I started looking at

391
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:38,590
this and I realized that most likely

392
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:42,080
somebody was sneaking into my system and

393
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:49,340
had added a user which shouldn't be

394
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:51,050
possible and so I did what anybody else

395
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,360
would I did the same thing that

396
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:55,399
everybody here would do I said I'm going

397
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,679
to monitor all the traffic coming in and

398
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,020
going out of my system over the weekend

399
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:07,390
it's Friday I'll just go and see what's

400
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:10,460
there and

401
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:12,740
and I'm dirt and I say well how do you

402
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:18,650
monitor this remember this is 1980 this

403
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:21,380
is 30 years ago and things like TCP dump

404
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:25,370
and Wireshark were these were things you

405
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:28,100
dreamt about the tools at hand were I

406
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:31,550
had a bunch of things called teletypes

407
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:33,590
anything here of a teletype oh you have

408
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:36,020
a beard do you have a gray beard you

409
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:37,490
know what this is right yes yes yes Oh a

410
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,730
teletype these were these were

411
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:44,570
mechanical things right oh you read the

412
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:47,060
book so teletypes were were mechanical

413
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:53,060
things at one point point point there

414
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:56,690
were impact printers and so I went

415
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:59,470
around so one of the very very few

416
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:02,000
things that I learned in graduate school

417
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:04,490
they don't teach you much in grad school

418
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,490
but there was one lesson I learned the

419
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:09,860
one lesson I learned was it's easier to

420
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:15,920
apologize later than to get permission

421
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:18,530
in advance so so I waited around till 5

422
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:22,580
o'clock 5:30 on a Friday afternoon and

423
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:25,040
said you know I got a hookup

424
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:31,570
we have about 40 modem lines coming in

425
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:34,220
40 or 50 modem and wide narrowband

426
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,080
things coming in I want to monitor then

427
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:39,020
the first way I'll monitor them is I'll

428
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,689
just take the PC or the Mac off my desk

429
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:45,350
put it in use clip leads to wire into

430
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:48,740
the rs-232 connector but after 2 or 3 or

431
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:53,689
5 pcs you kind of run out of pcs and

432
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:57,200
things to record data on so I then got

433
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:59,330
one of these lab carts you know push

434
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:04,340
carts over the lab and went along

435
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:07,939
building 50 liberating people's pcs from

436
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:12,230
their offices just sort of going from

437
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:16,670
office to office helping them empty

438
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:19,970
their desks and and by 7:30 or 8:00 I

439
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:21,080
had a collection of about Oh

440
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:26,320
4

441
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:28,730
50 PCs and Mackintosh's and and

442
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,149
teletypes and decorators and things like

443
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:36,019
this all connected around to this group

444
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:39,408
of of modems in VAX is and unix

445
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:41,799
workstations with clip leads to do multi

446
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:45,080
drop rs-232 which is another story that

447
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:46,970
a smart person of course any of you

448
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,220
would say oh why don't you just modify

449
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,919
the kernel so that you record everything

450
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:54,440
but look I'm a physics jock not a

451
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,480
programmer and I knew that I'd rake

452
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:03,019
things and I'd get all sorts of cool

453
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:07,450
cool messages so did this Kamin got a

454
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:11,269
sleeping bag a thermos of vegetarian of

455
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:18,529
minestrone soup then went to sleep next

456
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:20,330
to all of this woke up seven oh I'm

457
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:26,679
sorry I should stay on topic what was I

458
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:28,879
going to say was I going to say oh yeah

459
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:33,320
my mom will stuff to the second bullet

460
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:34,998
point yeah he detected an intruder and

461
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,279
he monitored his activity watch this

462
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:42,070
trace things back contact it analyzed an

463
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:49,820
estimated okay um enough said

464
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:53,960
so I'm there and I'm saying okay I'm I'm

465
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:57,230
there and I'm season next morning it's 8

466
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:00,919
9 in the morning I'm still half asleep

467
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:04,639
in my sleeping bag right next to this

468
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:08,269
old vac 780 that was left over from the

469
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:11,269
Late Jurassic age and and surrounded by

470
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:13,700
UNIX workstations that had really nice

471
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:18,559
warm fans that allowed you to sleep

472
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:21,919
without needing a sleeping bag and and

473
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:24,529
the sky comes in Roy Kurth he's the

474
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:29,210
assistant director of the lab so he's

475
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:31,190
got a beard and a tie he's important but

476
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,350
oh but it's Saturday morning so the tie

477
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,490
is missing but the beard is there and he

478
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:36,889
sort of kicks me

479
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:42,679
out of the sleeping bag and he says to

480
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:44,630
me I understand I understand that some

481
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:48,140
offices are missing some computer

482
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:50,000
equipment and I'm lying there surrounded

483
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,900
by these things and I say I haven't the

484
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,850
slightest idea I have no idea and he

485
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,720
says it would be a right neighborly

486
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:02,120
thing if all of it were returned to

487
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,070
which I say oh well sure and I start

488
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,350
hauling this stuff back up pushing on

489
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:08,389
lab carts up to building 50 a 50 beats

490
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:14,330
and getting it back to where it belongs

491
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:18,920
and on one of these printers it's 10 20

492
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:24,010
meters of printout of how somebody has

493
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:27,170
come into our system across from a modem

494
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:34,480
logged into our UNIX box used the

495
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:38,260
crontab set user ID to root program to

496
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:42,410
fire every five minutes fire up a

497
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:46,340
process that changes his account from

498
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:49,250
guest to route privilege turn off the

499
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,080
counting system to follow him and then

500
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,150
once accounting was shut off and he had

501
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:56,990
route privileged to go out across our

502
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:59,780
local area network into something called

503
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:02,590
a Cisco routers which I never even knew

504
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:06,710
that we had and then started

505
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:08,870
systematically breaking into or logging

506
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:15,950
into military computers around North

507
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:18,889
America looking at this printout and I'm

508
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:21,679
saying this is absolutely weird it's

509
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:24,710
it's utterly nonlinear because this is

510
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,510
Berkeley California you know you could

511
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:28,670
imagine somebody breaking into a

512
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:32,690
computer and stealing granola recipes

513
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:35,960
but it's Berkeley you don't you know soy

514
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:37,850
start looking at what he's gripping for

515
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,240
him sorry I'm looking at what what this

516
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:43,850
guy is looking for and it's stuff like

517
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,150
atomic things and and rocket tests and

518
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:52,730
I'm saying this is

519
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:52,730
this bizarre what's going on here why

520
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:59,970
it's so it immediately becomes clear how

521
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:04,879
to Cork things up I see what our set

522
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:10,290
user ID - root hole is I see that a a

523
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:12,120
mailing protocol of something called the

524
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:16,980
post office protocol had been installed

525
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,540
with set user ID - root that shouldn't

526
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,330
have been somebody made a minor mistake

527
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:23,280
in in doing this but that didn't answer

528
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:25,379
the real question namely why is somebody

529
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:30,020
breaking in and using our system like

530
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:32,820
this and what's going what's going on so

531
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:37,410
what what did I say next on that you

532
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:40,830
just tell me what does it say yeah that

533
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:44,340
one what does it say oh yeah yeah we

534
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:47,040
watch over so oh yeah of course of

535
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:53,970
course so I'm there and I'm saying you

536
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:56,280
know you know it's it's it's a

537
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:59,660
scientific institution so what's gonna

538
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:02,190
happen is Monday we have a meeting

539
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:04,920
naturally you know nothing ever happens

540
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:06,450
without a boring meeting so Monday

541
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:09,410
morning there's a meeting where

542
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:12,840
everybody in the confirm computing

543
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:15,330
physics and the lab director the lab

544
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:21,000
director shows up and Roy Kurtz is there

545
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:24,300
and he doesn't just have a beard and a

546
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,950
tie but he's got a suit so I'm there and

547
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:31,980
I'm trying to describe all the stuff and

548
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:36,270
the lab director says look yeah look at

549
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:38,910
this this guy is breaking into our

550
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:42,510
computer he has access to all of our

551
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:44,460
files all of all of our data he can

552
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:50,210
tamper with anything that he wants he

553
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:50,210
can erase anything that he wants he's

554
00:30:51,250 --> 00:31:03,800
he's holding us without he's genuinely

555
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,660
in charge of our computers and the

556
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:12,740
director of the Leia lab Dave Shirley

557
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:18,110
says this is important I want you to

558
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:20,810
catch the guy take all the personnel all

559
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:23,209
the resources all the time you need

560
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:25,700
I want you to catch the guy if it takes

561
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:28,760
three weeks I want you to find out who

562
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:33,920
it is so I had three weeks to fool

563
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:35,200
around and find out who it is so so how

564
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:42,080
much time do I have

565
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:45,560
timekeeper infinite time okay um um so

566
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:49,480
so I said to myself okay I gotta do

567
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:52,550
something about this where do I go so

568
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,620
again I pretty much did what anyone in

569
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:57,290
this room would do although I must say

570
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:59,929
things like Splunk and Wireshark didn't

571
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:02,180
exist but I did the manual equivalent of

572
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:07,940
this print it out

573
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:09,920
and and watch things I set up a serial

574
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:12,440
line analyzer so that when any of the

575
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:17,300
passwords that were compromised were

576
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:19,700
used it would pull a relay make it

577
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:22,100
outbound telephone dialer and dial a

578
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,870
pocket pager that I had and it would

579
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:28,070
send Morse code to me telling me what

580
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:30,770
was going on of course today the concept

581
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:33,770
of a pocket pager doesn't exist

582
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:37,280
the idea of Morse code over over an

583
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:41,980
analog voice line doesn't exist the word

584
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:44,899
analog doesn't exist so this is the

585
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:48,080
mentality that I was in and I assumed

586
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:51,320
that again any of you would do this in a

587
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:57,340
much more elegant and eloquent method

588
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:57,340
but I'm fooling around so over the next

589
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:04,159
over I'm thrilled that slide on once

590
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,430
again string your flashlight on and see

591
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:09,650
what it says um blablablablabla oh yeah

592
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:12,320
yeah um over the next year we watched

593
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:15,530
him try to break into about 450

594
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:18,050
computers manually one by one typing IP

595
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:19,670
networks in and there were almost

596
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:24,500
entirely military and defense

597
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:33,110
contractors meanwhile oh is this visible

598
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:39,200
even we traced things back to the source

599
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:43,850
which was we trace things backwards to

600
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:46,220
the source which which at the time the

601
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:48,379
FBI what I made this slide the FBI

602
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,240
wouldn't say he was coming from Hannover

603
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,820
Germany they said no we're prosecuting

604
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,100
so don't mention that it's from Hannover

605
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,629
we traced this back to a group of

606
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,659
computer hackers in Hannover Germany

607
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:01,280
which at the time was in West Germany

608
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,970
and they were working with a group in

609
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,620
East Germany and selling passwords

610
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:08,960
information gleaned and the whole kit

611
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:11,270
and kaboodle to a group called the Stasi

612
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,220
and the Stasi doesn't exist anymore so

613
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:15,509
again this is all dreamland out of

614
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:17,129
history that a few of you may

615
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:20,669
remember these words but most of you

616
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:22,530
will recognize them as times of an

617
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:23,940
easier day when there were good guys and

618
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:28,610
bad guys there was a difference between

619
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,610
them today there's it's hard to tell um

620
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,510
so it took a year to trace things back

621
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:35,820
me oh of course

622
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:37,860
um meanwhile it's visible on these

623
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:40,620
slides but I'll just point to it here

624
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:42,540
meanwhile we did we contacted anybody

625
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:45,299
that we thought might be interested

626
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,620
namely the Department of Energy the FBI

627
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,720
the Air Force Office of Special

628
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:52,080
Investigations national computer

629
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:54,839
Security Center the NSA CIA anybody that

630
00:34:52,080 --> 00:35:00,529
the local police even and it turned out

631
00:34:54,840 --> 00:35:02,820
that we learned right away that everyone

632
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:04,890
everyone wanted to hear what was going

633
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,350
on everybody wanted to see my log book

634
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:11,009
in my notebook but nobody was willing to

635
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:14,180
help it's just bizarre idea that well

636
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:16,650
sure we want to know what's going on but

637
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:18,089
solve your problem know when you solve

638
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:23,580
your problem tell us about it

639
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:26,100
so in addition there were really severe

640
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,230
communication protocol problems for

641
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:31,500
example in talking to the earth at the

642
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:34,170
time no one had heard of the internet

643
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,120
the internet essentially didn't exist it

644
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:38,820
was called the ARPANET in the ARPANET

645
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:40,200
was owned and operated by the military

646
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,790
and the Air Force Office of Special

647
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:48,180
Investigations was in charge of security

648
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:49,800
for it and they the language that I

649
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,799
spoke was different from the language

650
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,350
that they spoke so there was a what he

651
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,230
call of an impedance mismatch we're

652
00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:00,390
getting any traffic across the network

653
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:02,550
was was difficult because the language

654
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:08,400
didn't agree there was no mapping

655
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:13,950
function so what else did I say down

656
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:16,950
there yeah we analyzed the traffic

657
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:18,990
keywords targets and sure enough it was

658
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:22,379
almost all military stuff people were

659
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:24,479
looking at military things and again

660
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,100
this is utterly bizarre somebody's

661
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,109
trying to commit espionage over the

662
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:31,009
computer networks

663
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:32,569
and finally we found that of 400 to 500

664
00:36:31,009 --> 00:36:35,299
computers that somebody tried to break

665
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:37,549
into it was simple statistics to say oh

666
00:36:35,299 --> 00:36:41,180
the guy got into about 20 percent of

667
00:36:37,549 --> 00:36:43,400
these I'm sorry one in 25 percent of

668
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:45,759
these this guy broke in two in other

669
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:50,559
words computer computers were

670
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:53,559
surprisingly poorly secured you know

671
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:56,450
noticeably more than a few percent were

672
00:36:53,559 --> 00:37:00,319
absolutely open and vulnerable unlike

673
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:02,629
today when probably one in twenty

674
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:05,839
computers is open and quite vulnerable

675
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:07,190
so you know some things don't change go

676
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,769
on to the next slide if you can't I'd

677
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:12,430
like to know what to say next

678
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:12,430
if anything Oh

679
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:23,180
probably not our idea was here's our

680
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:27,890
chance to catch somebody you know if

681
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:29,719
there's if it's our chance if if

682
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:32,150
somebody's freaking you we're gonna try

683
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:36,170
to catch this person and go after them

684
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:38,569
and find out who's there so so ring an

685
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:41,630
alarm if the guys up you know to me this

686
00:37:38,569 --> 00:37:43,940
meant Oh put us hardware serial line

687
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,979
analyzer and look for the bitstream that

688
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:48,650
corresponds to a password that that's

689
00:37:45,979 --> 00:37:51,589
been compromised and then have it pull a

690
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:52,789
relay in and pull a dialer and dial a

691
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:55,369
pocket page here you know this is

692
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:57,440
primitive stuff but you know it it was a

693
00:37:55,369 --> 00:38:00,259
primitive time back before there were

694
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,999
things it was it was a primitive time

695
00:38:00,259 --> 00:38:05,660
back before people put sugar in their

696
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:09,259
coffee it was a time when it was a time

697
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:10,940
when there were it was a time when when

698
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:17,390
having such things as cell phones in

699
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:19,369
your pocket was unheard of and so so so

700
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,690
we figured okay well we'll try to catch

701
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:25,579
this guy we'll try to see what's going

702
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:29,989
on we'll also have periodic meetings

703
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:31,489
that would say thing and yeah we'd ring

704
00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:33,799
an alarm whenever the guy comes through

705
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:36,799
we'll print out what he does if there's

706
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:38,779
obvious danger if somebody's obviously

707
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:39,739
breaking in and about to delete our

708
00:38:38,779 --> 00:38:40,880
files do it

709
00:38:39,739 --> 00:38:45,559
RM

710
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,180
startup star will disconnect the guy but

711
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:49,009
the problem is you have to be careful

712
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:53,899
about disconnecting somebody don't just

713
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:56,450
want to pull the plug or do a pseudo and

714
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:58,460
and remove the guy you want to know that

715
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:01,609
he's not watching so I would go over and

716
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:03,799
take my keys in jangle them against the

717
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:07,069
comm lines they are the serial lines

718
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:09,319
that were connected in so that the

719
00:39:07,069 --> 00:39:10,910
protocol would slow down and slow down

720
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:13,190
and slow down to the error correction

721
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:17,180
until the person was unable to do much

722
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:22,479
my idea was concealed as much as

723
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:22,479
possible that I'm watching meanwhile

724
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:28,660
yeah notify authorities which was

725
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:31,069
largely a waste of time

726
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,348
notify other sites directly make a phone

727
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:34,819
call if necessary keep things off net

728
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:36,259
that was pretty easy to do because there

729
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:41,109
wasn't much of an that and protect our

730
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:43,430
users so enough of an introduction

731
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:45,229
watching this guy we watched him try to

732
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:47,989
break in stolen blah blah blah we

733
00:39:45,229 --> 00:39:51,890
watched for keywords and garbage like

734
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:54,170
this we watched him break systematically

735
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:58,538
break into ten or twenty thirty sites it

736
00:39:54,170 --> 00:40:02,359
was a it was a pretty nutty time um

737
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:09,769
meanwhile our local trace oh you wanted

738
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:16,249
to turn we wanted to trace things so

739
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:19,098
that first tracing things through our

740
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:22,669
own local area network this was the mid

741
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:25,160
to late-1980s tracing rings through our

742
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:28,940
local area network was a phenomenal

743
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:31,879
headache today tracing things through

744
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:34,759
the network in my own house is a

745
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,930
headache I'm astonished how poorly

746
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:41,180
documented and what poor software there

747
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:44,328
is to just tell you what your network

748
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:46,098
looks like forget tracing things over

749
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:48,739
the network where you have real IP

750
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:51,410
numbers it's hard to figure out what

751
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:53,160
connects to what and what's going over a

752
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:55,589
particular cable or

753
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:59,578
connected over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth at any

754
00:40:55,589 --> 00:41:01,410
instant it's surprisingly it's

755
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:03,299
surprisingly poor and the more things

756
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:06,019
that allow me to do it the more confused

757
00:41:03,299 --> 00:41:08,549
I get and I was plenty confused then

758
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:10,319
after tracing things from that we trace

759
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:15,119
things through our local area network

760
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:18,119
into a wide area network called time net

761
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:22,109
from time net we found that we're

762
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:23,640
connecting across North America into we

763
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:25,558
were able to trace the guy through

764
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:28,950
California we got a valid California

765
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:31,259
search warrant that led us over to a

766
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:33,779
place called McLean Virginia outside of

767
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:37,730
Washington DC in McLean Virginia we

768
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:40,410
found that somebody's we found that a

769
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:42,869
place that actually specialized in

770
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:48,450
computer security called mitre MIT re

771
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:52,109
mitre the MIT Research Institute was was

772
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:54,210
was the source of our troubles I call a

773
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:57,328
collar you know and trying to find this

774
00:41:54,210 --> 00:42:00,059
place was was quite challenging because

775
00:41:57,329 --> 00:42:01,769
our search warden didn't work across

776
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:04,410
States and getting across the North

777
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:06,180
America but eventually we find that we

778
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:09,680
found out who it was and was able to

779
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:11,970
show Oh somebody's breaking in and

780
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,410
they're coming out of your system tell

781
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:15,959
the guys and they pulled the plug on

782
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:18,808
their modem and we think ok that's the

783
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,329
end of it instead from then on we found

784
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:25,319
connections coming directly into our

785
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:28,289
system from Europe and we're able to see

786
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:30,740
that somebody is using an X 25 network

787
00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:33,829
which was an early frame relay network

788
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:37,140
now thoroughly obsolete from time net

789
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:40,710
someone was connecting from Europe into

790
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:43,078
our system in Berkeley and the

791
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:45,329
connection was by way of satellite links

792
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:48,450
called inter IRC an internet

793
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:51,150
international record carrier so we

794
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:55,230
called up them they put an engineer on

795
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:57,180
it who stopped by my house and we had a

796
00:42:55,230 --> 00:43:01,049
delightful evening together which

797
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,788
involved a pair of sneakers being dried

798
00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:03,230
out in a microwave oven but that's

799
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,750
another

800
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:09,859
that I won't tell you about um and and

801
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:13,700
during that time the representative from

802
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:15,319
time net was able to show that the

803
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,600
connection was coming from the

804
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:21,170
University of Bremen in Bremen Germany

805
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:24,080
so somehow there was a connection direct

806
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:26,930
from Raymond Germany through time net

807
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,940
into Berkeley into Berkeley into our

808
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:31,160
computer across there into the ARPANET

809
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:33,770
into military computers filching

810
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:36,140
information going backwards none of

811
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:38,810
which is surprising to anyone in this

812
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:41,509
room all of us like to talk about the

813
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:44,119
cloud as if connections are meaningless

814
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:46,580
to me connections are really important I

815
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:48,080
don't just want to know what the

816
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,560
connection is from over here to over

817
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,160
there

818
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:54,680
I want to see what the connections are I

819
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:59,060
want to see what the wiring is because

820
00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:03,250
really I'm a physics jock I like knowing

821
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:10,009
what wires connect from here to there to

822
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:12,770
elsewhere and I'm curious to see how you

823
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:18,320
get from here to there

824
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:20,210
Oh which is one of oh oh I'm sorry I

825
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,490
should have pointed out I do have an

826
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:31,750
organ organization for my talk is this

827
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:33,250
visible namely you know when you think

828
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:35,030
of course

829
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:38,000
[Applause]

830
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:41,030
of course you think you actually believe

831
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,120
that I'm following my PowerPoint slides

832
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:46,460
no my talk is right here in my hand just

833
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,839
before I start I write down what I want

834
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:52,160
to talk about and what's on my thumb

835
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:56,510
here is the word curiosity should there

836
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:58,819
be anything that I leave you with it's

837
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:01,910
not oh go out and buy my book it's not

838
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:06,500
to go out and and do something great

839
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:09,350
no it's be curious it's the one thing

840
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:14,120
it's the one thing that your boss will

841
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:16,460
never tell you to do be curious the

842
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:22,310
people who are doing this kinds of thing

843
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:28,670
the people who who are the people who

844
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:31,759
are who are in charge will always tell

845
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:35,480
you oh just obey the rules just do what

846
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:39,140
I'm telling you my idea is it's your

847
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:47,320
responsibility to figure things out and

848
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:53,270
to make is and to make sure that that

849
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:56,750
your your work is is is intellectually

850
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:59,360
satisfying your job whether it's

851
00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:02,650
teaching whether it's research whether

852
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:10,130
it's grunt computing and programming

853
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:16,660
your job is to be curious which to me

854
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:20,270
leads directly to what I was saying here

855
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:23,990
our idea was to trace things backwards

856
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:27,080
across a computer network and try to

857
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:32,270
figure things out and ultimately we did

858
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:35,390
some hacker uses a phone system in you

859
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:36,800
in HoN / connects to the German datex be

860
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:38,870
networked through the international

861
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,940
record carrier two-time net to Lawrence

862
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:43,370
Berkeley labs in Germany across the

863
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:46,130
ARPANET the MILNET and breaks into 1 mil

864
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:46,790
net site and then another end of my

865
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:48,210
story

866
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:51,270
as far as as

867
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:56,040
the NSA was concerned this was all they

868
00:46:51,270 --> 00:47:01,290
wanted to know Oh 15 showed to them I

869
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:09,720
don't want to know about it um sugar

870
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:12,869
thank you and in more detail for my

871
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:14,689
friends at the NSA you know how what are

872
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:17,849
the details of how this happened

873
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:20,160
datex Network University of Bremen Micro

874
00:47:17,849 --> 00:47:25,079
VAX from their connecting across

875
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:27,328
networks and the ddn's on meanwhile we

876
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:29,760
had an interesting problem after five

877
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:33,599
months in we had we were able to

878
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:37,609
localize the problem back to Hannover

879
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:40,170
Germany but we found that here we are

880
00:47:37,609 --> 00:47:44,098
tracing things back in the middle of the

881
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:46,619
night into into Hannover Germany but the

882
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:49,500
guy either because of lousy phone lines

883
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:51,869
or smarts on the part of the people

884
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:56,309
breaking it and would disconnect after

885
00:47:51,869 --> 00:48:04,799
15-20 minutes all of this happened way

886
00:47:56,309 --> 00:48:07,440
back way long ago when you remember when

887
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:11,040
telephones were connected by things

888
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:13,549
called wires yes wait wait wait you have

889
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:17,730
to say yes yes I do

890
00:48:13,549 --> 00:48:20,790
once upon a time the thing in your

891
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:23,640
pocket was called a wallet once upon a

892
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:26,250
time you if you wanted to make a

893
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,170
telephone call you went over to the wall

894
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:30,329
you picked up this thing called a

895
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:35,900
handset and you put your finger in

896
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:35,900
something called a dial anyone go

897
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:50,000
these things called

898
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:54,830
rotary phones and in order the way they

899
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:57,650
worked was as when you made a dial two

900
00:48:54,830 --> 00:49:00,200
three four kilometres away a bunch of

901
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:04,460
solenoids and relays it goes click click

902
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:06,020
click click and it's so doing if you

903
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:09,110
wanted to make a phone trace you didn't

904
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:11,570
type something in on a user interface

905
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:15,620
and say trace this number you had to

906
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:19,610
have a human being take a taxicab to

907
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:22,150
downtown Hanover and get out an ohmmeter

908
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:24,980
a voltmeter and start tracing solenoids

909
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:28,310
in a big building called a central

910
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:31,340
exchange in other words that would take

911
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:32,509
an hour to make a phone trace just took

912
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,940
five minutes to say it would take an

913
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:36,350
hour to make a phone trace um the

914
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:39,020
problem was this guy would only connect

915
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:41,029
for 20 minutes or half an hour so the

916
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:47,090
question was how do I keep this hacker

917
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:50,300
online for 15-20 minutes an hour hour

918
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:55,240
and a half what's the next thing they're

919
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:55,240
just show me what's quick quick quick

920
00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:01,940
January 17 1977 finding traces to an

921
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:08,930
individual hints of involvement oh cool

922
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:14,260

absolutely sweet haven't you always

927
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:37,400
wanted to be a chess champion what don't

928
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:40,279
just tell me tell everybody I would yeah

929
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:43,069
wouldn't it be cool to not just be an

930
00:50:40,279 --> 00:50:51,190
ordinary chess champion but to get a

931
00:50:43,069 --> 00:50:54,859
chess rating 1500 1800 2000 say yes yes

932
00:50:51,190 --> 00:51:00,349
this guy over here no kidding

933
00:50:54,859 --> 00:51:08,150
this guy Arthur Arthur Fiske where he's

934
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:14,499
in he's a people need classes he's a

935
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:21,499
what don't tell me that I tell them that

936
00:51:14,499 --> 00:51:27,589
this guy earther bisque where he's gonna

937
00:51:21,499 --> 00:51:39,348
teach me and you how to always win at

938
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:48,440
chess right here 10 tips on how to win

939
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:55,759
it just by international Grandmaster all

940
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:59,900
you need to know is rule number two he's

941
00:51:55,759 --> 00:52:02,779
going to give you ten rules if you only

942
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:06,499
know rule number two you'll always win

943
00:52:02,779 --> 00:52:10,430
at chess and because of mathematical

944
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:17,299
game theory this applies to computing if

945
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:21,368
you want to translate ah yes yes yes you

946
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:26,980
want to win at chess rule number two

00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:35,970
zoom in on that let's work you know make

949
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:37,859
the best possible move you know when in

950
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:39,569
doubt when you're trying to decide

951
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:42,900
should I make a lousy move or a good

952
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:48,180

955
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:59,330
considering entering into a relationship

956
00:52:54,980 --> 00:53:09,810
rule number four is also useful namely

957
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:21,299
know what the men are worth having said

958
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:24,330
that can I say in the immortal words of

959
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:27,180
the Oakland Tribute Tribune stolen his

960
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:29,790
sweetheart were in the shower together

961
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:32,100
one day when they came up with a

962
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:37,440
solution to trying to keep this hacker

963
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:39,299
online they come they build a crate very

964
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,100
large file full of completely bogus

965
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:44,070
information about what the topics they

966
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:45,930
knew the hacker was interested in the

967
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:47,840
time that he spent downloading it would

968
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:50,609
give the police time to track him down

969
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:52,530
we tried to make the file look really

970
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:54,690
bureaucratic good boring his girlfriend

971
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:56,490
said if we had said look here it's

972
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:58,620
classified information he would have

973
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:00,899
caught on right away the trick worked

974
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:02,970
the hacker came across the file and

975
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:05,640
spent more than an hour loading it into

976
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:07,589
his own computer during that time German

977
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:10,230
police were able to trace his telephone

978
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:12,600
number stolen his sweetheart celebrated

979
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:16,440
their triumphs with milkshakes made from

980
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:19,890
homegrown Berkeley strawberries so we

981
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:22,700
waited the obvious namely we created a

982
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:25,410
completely bogus file a set of these

983
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:27,509
containing what was then a huge amount

984
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:30,060
of information many many megabytes of

985
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:34,820
information and allowed this guy time to

986
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:34,820
just download it to

987
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:45,180
we this guy spent more than an hour

988
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:47,880
downloading all of this garbage into his

989
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:49,830
computer and to make these bogus files

990
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,410
we didn't just make the usual bogus

991
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:55,259
files all we did was took bureaucratic

992
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:57,629
college memos and research memos and

993
00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:00,630
changed people's names to Colonel in

994
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:03,060
general and lieutenants and it turns out

995
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,859
that bureaucratic memos are the same

996
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:06,480
everywhere they look and sound the same

997
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:11,640
all you had to do is make it look more

998
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:13,380
like oh this is secret stuff flip to the

999
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:21,440
next thing is there a sample of what we

1000
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:24,119
put together yes sir visible not

1001
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,890
probably not very visible those of you

1002
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:30,750
in the front row can see that this is

1003
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:33,450
all a dot matrix printer stuff and if

1004
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:36,420
you look carefully oh yeah it says name

1005
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:38,640
name city city states dear sir blah blah

1006
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:42,780
blah look carefully up there and you'll

1007
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:45,990
see the more command this those of you

1008
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:49,050
who are UNIX jocks probably know about

1009
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:52,618
the less command which is a way of

1010
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:54,990
printing things out on your screen the

1011
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:56,820
less command evolved from the more

1012
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:59,580
command and the more command devolved

1013
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:03,420
from cat which was just to catenate

1014
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:05,660
files out but this is one of dozens and

1015
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:09,570
dozens of files at this guy printed out

1016
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:11,640
which in this case says dear sir thank

1017
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:14,130

1028
00:56:38,609 --> 00:56:45,540
the guy about two hours an hour and a

1029
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:47,720
half two hours to print print all this

1030
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,720
out

1031
00:56:50,500 --> 00:57:00,410
and over the next over the next a couple

1032
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:02,270
days we find that the German one

1033
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:05,660
discriminant in the Bundespost have

1034
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:08,900
tracked the number back to source number

1035
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:13,609
three a clock see Strasse an apartment

1036
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:16,130
in Hannover Germany we find that indeed

1037
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:17,990
somebody has somebody from this place is

1038
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:21,050
breaking into our computer they start

1039
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:22,520
phone traces they keep tracking them but

1040
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:24,350
they're clever police they're not like

1041
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,480
me they're smart rather than going in

1042
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:29,890
and busting them immediately they wait

1043
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:35,570
they wait for a month to three months

1044
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:47,240
three months after that file from our

1045
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:54,890
UNIX computer gets uploaded into three

1046
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:58,279
months later oh yeah zoom in on this

1047
00:57:54,890 --> 00:58:01,339
professor camera person three months

1048
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:04,580
afterwards we get a letter in the mail

1049
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:07,220
no kidding a letter comes for this

1050
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:12,080
completely fictitious secretary the one

1051
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:14,120
that this this fake secretary receives a

1052
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:19,009
letter in the mail from a guy named

1053

documents document 37.6 blah blah blah

1056
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:30,410
somehow or another this fraudulent

1057
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:35,360
information that we placed on our UNIX

1058
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:41,350
system in January by April had found its

1059
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:46,250
way into a Bulgarian a Bulgarian

1060

1065
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:07,560
on some guy named laszlo Balin I take a

1066
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:10,350
look at this letter that says blablabla

1067
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:12,240
it's addressed to the SDI network

1068
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:13,490
project did Berkeley California they

1069
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,319
spell our name wrong

1070
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:38,520
dear mrs. Sherwin blablabla as will be

1071
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:42,540
low what's these documents I'm looking

1072
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:47,280
at this and I say oh my god this is

1073
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:51,420
serious you know this is like some guy

1074
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:53,910
who's a spy and so I did what anybody

1075
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:56,190
else would do in Berkeley I call it the

1076
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:59,069
FBI and the FBI says oh my god that's

1077
00:59:56,190 --> 01:00:05,190
serious whatever you do don't touch that

1078
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:13,860
letter back because there's fingerprints

1079
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:19,740
on it so put on some latex gloves get a

1080
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:21,930
glassine envelope find the letter don't

1081
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:23,220
touch it don't touch to that letter it's

1082
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:24,839
got fingerprints on it

1083
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:27,450
you're supposed to hold it up like this

1084
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:29,340
you're supposed to put flat and you

1085
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:31,109
don't just hold it like this you hold it

1086
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:33,780
by the middle because the fingerprints

1087
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:36,600
are all around the edge and you sort of

1088
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:41,160
put it in the you put it in this glass

1089
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:44,009
scene envelope you flip flip and then

1090
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:45,839
you take it over to the FedEx box in

1091
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:49,080
downtown Berkeley to get it over to the

1092
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:51,150
crime headquarters in Washington DC but

1093
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:54,150
by accidents along the way I'm running

1094
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:57,240
over to the FedEx box entirely by

1095
01:00:54,150 --> 01:01:00,770
accident I bumped into a photocopier so

1096
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,770
I now have a copy of this um

1097
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:17,250
um much time do I have what one minute

1098
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:18,089
two minutes five minutes okay um ten

1099
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:30,270
minutes okay

1100
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:35,610
so in short following yeah leave Leave

1101
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:37,500
I'm following this the the yeah the FBI

1102
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:42,360
actually took me seriously for a short

1103
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:44,760
period of time and was over the next six

1104
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:47,880
months prosecuted these people in in

1105
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:51,120
Germany on charges of espionage and it

1106
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:55,110
was one of those weird things of hey

1107
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:57,470
somebody's and a group of five hackers

1108
01:01:55,110 --> 01:02:00,630
one committed suicide along the way

1109
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:03,959
three others were convicted of espionage

1110
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:08,270
and then the Berlin Wall came down and

1111
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:13,830
they were subsequently not imprisoned

1112
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:15,900
set a sets the ball rolling for a number

1113
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:17,730
of different things all of which is an

1114
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,440
introduction to what I wanted to say

1115
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:21,690
which is outlined on my hand and

1116
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:25,580
apparently I've got five or six minutes

1117
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:28,170
to say what I wanted to say let's see I

1118
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:31,470
want to say thanks to Nick thanks to

1119
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:33,960
Travis of course um orthogonality in

1120
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:37,140
computer security routers I mentioned

1121
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:41,460
our Cisco router that we had Cisco

1122
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:44,359
router serial number three I did mention

1123
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:47,790
rule number two and rule number four I

1124
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:51,950
have a note saying that this is my left

1125
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:51,950
hand I'm not sure why I have that

1126
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:08,470
it sounds it sounds like what I have to

1127
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:13,430
say is thoroughly and utterly obsolete I

1128
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:16,129
agree with you it is there is nothing

1129
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:18,500
that I've said so far that I think you

1130
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:23,690
wouldn't do yourself given the

1131
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:27,110
circumstances again my idea is the

1132
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:30,290
curious person when they see something

1133
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:32,090
that's out of the ordinary will look at

1134
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:33,430
things and try to figure out how do you

1135
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:36,020
deal with this what do you do with it

1136
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:38,720
what's what's the connectivity from over

1137
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:42,230
here to over there what's the how do how

1138
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:46,100
do things work what's going on in my

1139
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:50,540
system I gotta know it's not enough to

1140
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:54,980
say oh I was told X Y Z or them or the

1141
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:59,180
man pages say ABC no I gotta understand

1142
01:03:54,980 --> 01:04:01,610
that's why we're here so should I leave

1143
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:03,649
you with any words of wisdom and I don't

1144
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:09,230
have wisdom so I'll leave you with words

1145
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:14,390
namely be curious don't allow weirdness

1146
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:16,370
in your system to go non understood one

1147
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:18,319
thing that I've been barking at for five

1148
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:21,980
or six years has been the idea that

1149
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:25,730
computer security goes works perfectly

1150
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:28,520
alongside efficient computing that

1151
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:31,130
quality security does not get in the way

1152
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:32,980
of our users but rather helps our users

1153
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:36,350
get get along with one another and

1154
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:39,140
isolates them just the right amount from

1155
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:42,620
one another that quality system

1156
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:44,930
management works well with quality with

1157
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:48,640
quality security one thing that I'm

1158
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:52,580
interested in is how to orthogonalize

1159
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:55,490
security from from system administration

1160
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:58,400
so that a system administrator who has

1161
01:04:55,490 --> 01:05:02,350
really has keys to the whole system can

1162
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:04,910
be detected by the security personnel

1163
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:07,730
operating independently of one other

1164
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:10,580
term how do we make systems where this

1165
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:13,430
where we cannot fully trust

1166
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:16,520
system manager how can we make systems

1167
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:19,160
that will give us tripwire advance

1168
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:21,259
notice that there's trouble within the

1169
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:25,609
systems that we're managing how can we

1170
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:29,660
make networks that that will warn us

1171
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:32,510
when an idiot has done something stupid

1172
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:35,720
to me these are fascinating questions

1173
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:41,150
that happily are your domain for

1174
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:44,180
exploring and fooling around with I was

1175
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:47,110
I would like to mention something I

1176
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:49,970
mentioned to Travis the other day that

1177
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:52,850
I'm now making mathematical shapes

1178
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:54,799
called klein bottles those of you who

1179
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:56,900
are mathematicians those of you who have

1180
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:59,540
PhDs in mathematics will immediately

1181
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:02,330
recognize this is a one-sided surface

1182
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:04,730
called a Klein bottle and you'll say wow

1183
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:07,430
that's cool those of you who have PhDs

1184
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:10,400
in mathematics will say wow that is so

1185
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:11,810
cool and so neat I gotta have one well

1186
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,180
it just so happens that I'm donating

1187
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:18,650
this to Travis so that he can give this

1188
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:20,899
away tomorrow afternoon for in ways that

1189
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:23,540
he will decide and those of you who know

1190
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:25,880
about Klein bottles will say yeah but

1191
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:27,920
that one's made of glass can't you make

1192
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:31,760
it out of something more interesting and

1193
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:36,260
the answer is why of course with my wife

1194
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:44,330
I've knitted a Klein bottle hat as well

1195
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:48,500
as a matching Mobius loop scarf and

1196
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:52,750
you'll notice that it works even on the

1197
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:55,610
East Coast so thank you very much

1198
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:58,240
however I can't let you have it Travis

1199
01:06:55,610 --> 01:07:02,000
mate when he gives this away tomorrow so

1200
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:04,689
having said that should I shut up or

1201
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:10,070
should I say something else say more um

1202
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:14,330
no no no no no I'm on my little finger

1203
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:16,220
over here it says all truth sure sure

1204
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:23,720
does okay notice he even agrees with me

1205
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:24,319
um going back aways in 1973 I was an

1206
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,939
undergrad

1207
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:28,400
at the State University of New York at

1208
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:30,290
Buffalo across from Fort Erie and used

1209
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:34,850
to bicycle Deford areas hangouts a

1210
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:37,070
couple friends of mine and while an

1211
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:39,259
undergraduate there were riots going on

1212
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:42,400
on campus have protesting some water or

1213
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:44,960
something like this and the riots were

1214
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:48,200
had nothing to do with me because at the

1215
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:51,080
time I was studying physics and as I was

1216
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:52,759
studying physics I figure you know riots

1217
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:58,250
I don't care anything so one April

1218
01:07:52,760 --> 01:08:00,050
evening the people were rioting on

1219
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:02,720
campus and there was a midterm coming up

1220
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:05,450
in my physics department so I said I'm

1221
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:08,089
gonna find out what's going on here and

1222
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:12,890
so I'm walking across campus like 9

1223
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:15,980
o'clock in the evening and there's a

1224
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:20,389
policeman cop over there looks at me and

1225
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:23,270
says you you're a student but I say yeah

1226
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:27,260
I'm a student but I'm not a riot or I'm

1227
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:30,799
studying physics statistical mechanics

1228
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:34,130
thermodynamics mechanics guy says you

1229
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:37,160
you're a student and the guy reaches

1230
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:41,660
behind him pulls auto-rifle goes kaboom

1231
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:44,779
and a tear gas canister the size of the

1232
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:45,410
size of a pepsi-cola can goes what's in

1233
01:08:44,779 --> 01:08:48,589
front of me

1234
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:51,589
I got a breath of air tear gas that I

1235
01:08:48,589 --> 01:08:58,100
can't breathe and this placements coming

1236
01:08:51,589 --> 01:09:01,220
after me and he wants it with with a

1237
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:03,109
rifle because I'm a rioter and saying

1238
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:05,540
I'm not writing I'm a student studying

1239
01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:08,600
quantum mechanics and physics ain't

1240
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:10,490
chasing me across campus over to the

1241
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,589
bell tower on campus there's

1242
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:15,410
Campanelli bell tower I go run across

1243
01:09:12,589 --> 01:09:17,930
campus I'd say this is bizarre what am I

1244
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:20,899
doing here why am I here then to sky

1245
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:23,240
young what 22 23 years old guys chasing

1246
01:09:20,899 --> 01:09:24,719
me into this across campus have seen

1247
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:30,279
this

1248
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:32,589
I'm not right I'm just being me and it

1249
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:35,019
Jason means building up two flights of

1250
01:09:32,589 --> 01:09:39,160
stairs there's a door about a meter and

1251
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:41,380
a half tall metre wide I look at the

1252
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:42,849
door the door looks at me I pull it open

1253
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:47,680
I jump in

1254
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:51,490
pull the door closed it's the door to

1255
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:55,450
the bell tower there's a policeman

1256
01:09:51,490 --> 01:10:00,340
banging on the door but I'm inside the

1257
01:09:55,450 --> 01:10:03,610
door is latched I look around it's the

1258
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:09,850
bell tower at the University of Buffalo

1259
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:12,790
and if I look around it's dark and even

1260
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:17,440
though it's dark I can see that there's

1261
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:21,820
a machine with brass gears and your

1262
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:25,710
pendulum going tick tick tick yeah

1263
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:25,710
looking at the same this is weird

1264
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:31,030
but I realize oh it's the clock it's you

1265
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,830
know the pendulum is driving a clock and

1266
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:34,420
the clock is driving you know that's one

1267
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:36,970
of these bell towers it has a clock on

1268
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:42,160
the outside you know you like up up by

1269
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:44,410
the Citadel and I look at the clock and

1270
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:46,389
I look at the pendulum I realized that

1271
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:47,740
the mechanics of a pendulum say that if

1272
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:50,380
you shorten the pain you let me takes

1273
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:51,460
faster lengthen it tick slower and the

1274
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:53,620
square root of the length is

1275
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:55,150
proportional to the period for small arc

1276
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:56,650
lengths that I'm remembering my physics

1277
01:10:55,150 --> 01:11:00,969
I'm saying okay I can get that on the

1278
01:10:56,650 --> 01:11:03,099
next week's midterm but then I look from

1279
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:07,960
it and from the set of gears from this

1280
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:11,290
clock down here is some dowels going up

1281
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:15,970
into some differential gears up behind

1282
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:19,210
so I walk up this staircase as I walk up

1283
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:22,920
the staircase I get to a place where I'm

1284
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:29,290
behind four clocks and they're lit up

1285
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:32,650
and the hands are moving backwards again

1286
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:36,190
it's like it's like the clock up up here

1287
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:37,030
where you see it's from the front it

1288
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:38,650
looks like oh it's

1289
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:40,990
right now been pointing to 12 o'clock

1290
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:43,809
for the past few weeks but eventually

1291
01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:45,550
the clock hands and start moving but

1292
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:47,110
from the inside the clock hands are

1293
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:48,640
turning backwards I'm looking at it

1294
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:50,650
thinking how do you get time to go

1295
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,910
backwards what's the physics of turning

1296
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:58,120
time backwards I'm thinking about

1297
01:11:51,910 --> 01:12:00,940
Lorentz contractions and and and I'm

1298
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:05,200
asking myself why am I here

1299
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:08,379
what am I doing here they see that

1300
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:10,030
there's a steer not your face there's a

1301
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:13,120
ladder going from there so I start

1302
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:17,110
climbing this rickety ladder and I push

1303
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:18,910
open hatchway a little hatchway that

1304
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:19,809
goes up to the top and where there's

1305
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:22,300
four bells

1306
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:27,010
there'll be brass bells and they've been

1307
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:29,860
poured out of brass and around it is a

1308
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:32,380
cupola maybe 2 or 3 meters in diameter

1309
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:34,570
and I can look out through the little

1310
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:36,520
arched windows and I can see down on

1311
01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:40,269
campus it's 10 o'clock at night and

1312
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:43,120
watching students throwing bricks at the

1313
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:44,890
police I'm watching the police shooting

1314
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:47,019
tear gas it's the students that I'm

1315
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:49,440
saying this is bizarre what am I doing

1316
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:53,020
here why am I here

1317
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:55,269
and then I remembered what my high

1318
01:12:53,020 --> 01:13:02,700
school teacher English teacher said to

1319
01:12:55,270 --> 01:13:06,370
me that when people when people fake

1320
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:09,460
when when people make these bells they

1321
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:11,590
write an inscription on them so I reach

1322
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:15,010
over and wipe the pigeon burner off one

1323
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:17,050
of these bells and I asked the Bell why

1324
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:25,120
am I here and the Bell answer is loud

1325
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:29,050
and clear so at this time at this time

1326
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:37,150
I'd like to tell you the words inscribed

1327
01:13:29,050 --> 01:13:43,860
on a cell tower bells namely all truth

1328
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:49,469
is one in this light may science and

1329
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:54,259
religion endeavor here for the steady

1330
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:59,100
of mankind from darkness to light from

1331
01:13:54,260 --> 01:14:05,940
narrowness to broad-mindedness from

1332
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:13,400
prejudice to tolerance it is the voice

1333
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:16,519
of life which calls us to come and learn

1334
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,519
thank you

1335
