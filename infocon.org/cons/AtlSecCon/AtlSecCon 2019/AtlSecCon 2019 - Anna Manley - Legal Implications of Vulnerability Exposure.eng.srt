1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:15,239
okay all right I can tell this is

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:18,869
working actually seems quite okay so hi

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,670
everybody i'm anna manly i actually i

4
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:25,109
tried to remember the first year that I

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,470
was here I think it was 2015 sounds

6
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,840
about right

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,279
okay so I just want to start by saying

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,948
this is completely unrelated to my talk

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,620
but the first year I was here I had the

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:50,280
bathroom all to myself

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:55,349
it was great this year yes absolutely

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,090
amazing so good for you yeah no but I

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:02,910
will require a private bathroom next

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:04,589
time I come back okay so this talk is I

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,899
also need to start by say I'm going to

16
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:11,400
give you a few disclaimers here not my

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,960
usual area so I put this abstract in for

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,000
this talk I thought that it would be

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,189
easy there's actually books written on

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,210
this topic so what I had attempted to do

21
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:27,000
is the state of the law in this area

22
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:32,758
I've attempted to make you extremely

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,320
paranoid activities but I also tried to

24
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,470
give you basically a working level of

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:50,490
knowledge in this area and what happens

26
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:55,610
when you voluntarily yourself this is a

27
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,270
very cursory talk some of the details so

28
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,490
I'm a lawyer

29
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,020
none of this is legal advice all that

30
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,810
stuff this is my usual disclaimer

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,689
it's my answer to 90% of your questions

32
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,830
is going to be it depends so and that's

33
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,690
incredibly annoying

34
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,690
I know that but it really does depend on

35
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,489
so but this talk was also and the title

36
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,510
of this talk was just an excuse for me

37
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:23,190
to see how many cat pictures

38
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,630
presentation I'm attempting to break my

39
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,980
own record I don't know what that is but

40
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,310
I think I've broken it with this slide

41
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:32,070
alone so spoiler alert I'm successful so

42
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,440
the reason I wanted to do this talk is

43
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,150
that last year around this time a young

44
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,550
man we already talked about in this

45
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,160
morning which is good he's 19 years old

46
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,260
he was arrested and it was important to

47
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,090
be a very spectacular raid the reports

48
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,620
of his floorboards being torn up to find

49
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:50,130
offending computers I'm not sure if

50
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,050
that's true but that's that that truth

51
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,640
or lie has entered the zeitgeist so

52
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,990
that's part of it's part of the story

53
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,089
now and he faced prison time for

54
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,160
unauthorized use of a computer when he

55
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,630
downloaded approximately 7,000 documents

56
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,880
from the provinces freedom of

57
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,910
information and protection of privacy

58
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,549
website using their request portal their

59
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:15,060
client portal so what actually happened

60
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,860
is he changed the end of a URL and then

61
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,750
of having access to private information

62
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,860
and other users of the portal

63
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,160
information that he shouldn't have had

64
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,680
access to and he downloaded all of the

65
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:29,280
information because you know why not and

66
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,500
a lot of trouble so this is this

67
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,320
document is horrible I'm sorry I promise

68
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:38,750
but it's actually it's relevant so the

69
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:42,239
reactions ranged from poor kid to

70
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:49,709
underdog hero type right for this guy

71
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:52,200
it's kind of this the story of this

72
00:03:49,709 --> 00:04:01,230
community and I started to call him the

73
00:03:52,200 --> 00:04:02,579
double you get kid super I called him

74
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,280
this in spite of the fact that he was

75
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,140
not a kid right he was 19 years old and

76
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,239
he was really a hero he was just a

77
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,708
curious kid who screwed up and to me

78
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:15,360
quite frankly pissed the wrong people

79
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:17,190
off so but as we as we talked about this

80
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,750
morning the Halifax police did

81
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,358
eventually drop the charges

82
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,150
this guy and I think that all of you

83
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,940
breathe a collective sigh of relief for

84
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,739
your teenage selves because you've had

85
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,480
all probably done something at least

86
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:35,790
kind of similar in the past I'm not

87
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:38,820
looking at anybody alright so but this

88
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,670
incident was very important because it

89
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:45,659
taught us something about how

90
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:48,690
organizations respond to not only

91
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,780
breaches but also disclosure security

92
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,540
vulnerabilities a lot about how the

93
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,090
visceral reaction that they have not

94
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,890
only is it extreme it's also very Swift

95
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,440
and I'm not just referring to law

96
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,240
enforcement this was this was an OSHA

97
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,410
government basically saying this is

98
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,300
happening and we think we're being

99
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,190
hacked and somebody saved the children

100
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,160
oh my god everybody's going to die right

101
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,960
so the emotional reaction actually does

102
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,760
make sense because people the nature of

103
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,859
the information that was on this portal

104
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,630
this is information that is intensely

105
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,400
personal okay and it very it was for the

106
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:25,380
request so it was it wasn't one

107
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,469
particular type of information this was

108
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:37,020
basically all of them from all types of

109
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:41,490
information which is why the government

110
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:43,500
and many organizations have this free

111
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,430
code most organizations have some kind

112
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,680
of intense and personal information

113
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:51,900
because so that's how I'm not saying

114
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,690
it's justified I'm saying I understand

115
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,489
their emotional reaction so this is also

116
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,890
why they're so quick to complete

117
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,510
innocent discovery with nefarious

118
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:03,360
purpose because they're not quite sure

119
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:08,280
how to draw a line between the two of

120
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,770
them but there was a lot of speculation

121
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,280
here last year about this kid's

122
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:16,740
motivations however it seemed to most

123
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,479
outside observers that was just a see

124
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:23,600
how deep the rabbit-hole goes type of

125
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,599
situation or like this type of situation

126
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:30,840
or this type of sweater bully related

127
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:34,680
and whoever gets this reference wins so

128
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:38,330
I wasn't surprised by the story in the

129
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:42,930
least okay I have represented companies

130
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:44,520
and the initial calls when they come in

131
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,790
are panicked

132
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,010
they are very intense conversations and

133
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,710
people people do get very up in arms

134
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:56,670
about having somebody tell them that

135
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:59,969
they have security now I have pleasure

136
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:04,590
of knowing many of you and my spouse

137
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:07,590
himself is a wizard so I know that

138
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:10,409
you're very curious people I know that

139
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:12,840
and that's - that's - your collective

140
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:18,540
credit that is consistent across the

141
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:21,630
entire industry and I know that you have

142
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,070
a cat and mouse mentality there's

143
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,540
nothing wrong with that but think the

144
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,990
language is the language that you use to

145
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:31,110
describe your glossary right honey pot

146
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:35,960
phishing breach brute-force Trojan horse

147
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:39,960
these are the languages of war and games

148
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,210
right so and it's very playful but the

149
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,810
playfulness and curiosity that you have

150
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:48,599
that's necessary in the industry can get

151
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,650
you into a lot of trouble and trouble

152
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:57,600
with the law

153
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:59,429
all right so that's what I want - I

154
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,000
really just want to talk about on a

155
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:10,380
practical level when you disclose

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:12,360
bilities as volunteer what happens so

157
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,340
I've spoken about this section of the

158
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,400
criminal code before it used to have a

159
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:20,909
different number used to be three 41.1

160
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,200
it has changed sometimes here so this is

161
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,910
the anti hacking provision of the

162
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,789
criminal code all right don't read it

163
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:28,260
it's boring but basically what it is is

164
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,930
that if you fraudulently are without

165
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,090
color right either intercept any

166
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,700
function of a computer system obtain a

167
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,290
computer service or use a computer

168
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,169
system with the intent

169
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:42,978
or intercept a computer service or you

170
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:45,480
use a password or traffic in a password

171
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:49,500
obviously without the right to have that

172
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:54,000
password then you're caught by the code

173
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:59,880
so it really does does cover the

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:08,310
majority of the activities all right now

175
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:11,760
the last section refers to mischief so

176
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:15,209
any hacking where your goal is mischief

177
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:19,520
has you caught by section there's

178
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,520
actually a specific section that deals

179
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,740
this one is with you willfully destroy

180
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:30,100
or alter data or if you render data

181
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:32,920
meaningless useless or ineffective or if

182
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,500
you interfere with lost lawful access or

183
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,969
use of a system then you are in breach

184
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,740
of this mischief provision so you are

185
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,940
causing mischief I know that that sounds

186
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:45,430
fun but it's actually pretty bad so this

187
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,950
this one is like I said it's specific to

188
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,719
computer data you can also be found

189
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,160
guilty under the general mischief

190
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,200
provisions that this one is all about

191
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,480
people who make that like denial of

192
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,450
service attacks right so and also people

193
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,780
who make that unintelligible so mischief

194
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:04,770
over $5,000 so where the damage that

195
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:08,350
you've caused by way of mischief is over

196
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:11,920
$5,000 carries a maximum penalty of 10

197
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:15,340
years and if the mischief causes an

198
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,520
actual danger to life not if it causes

199
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:22,060
harm if it causes an actual danger to

200
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:25,060
life the maximum punishment is life

201
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:29,430
imprisonment so that's pretty serious

202
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:31,900
pretty damn serious for hacking now I

203
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,719
guess in order to understand these laws

204
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,459
you need to understand the state of the

205
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,880
law before they came into effect and

206
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,440
what what whole these laws were we're

207
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:46,750
filling what what gap they were filling

208
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,800
so this case the crown beam are I think

209
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,470
I'm saying that right it happened to

210
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,030
2015 it was try it was decided in 2015

211
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,550
but the offenses actually took place

212
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:57,910
earlier than that so this was a

213
00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:01,569
situation where a gentleman with some

214
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:03,579
knowledge of computers I told his

215
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:06,310
girlfriend that he would fix her

216
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:09,190
computer and he decided that he would

217
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:10,719
extract the sexy pictures of her off of

218
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:16,360
that computer and save them onto his

219
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:19,840
computer and then they broke up you know

220
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,680
what happens he decided to distribute

221
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:26,670
these images not only at her workplace

222
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:31,420
but also post them online on various

223
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:33,099
sites so it should come cops all right

224
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,349
so so there's there's this court case

225
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:38,950
and one of the questions that arose

226
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:43,750
at the hearing and trial was whether or

227
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:45,370
not he had stolen her data whether or

228
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,800
not he had actually taken something from

229
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:50,170
her so this is more of a theft and

230
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,180
unfortunately at the time the only law

231
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:56,079
that would have protected her from that

232
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:58,300
theft of data basically her only hacking

233
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,820
light provision at the time was for

234
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:06,670
theft but the court held in this case

235
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:11,110
that he could be found guilty it wasn't

236
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:13,120
something that could be taken now this

237
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,800
is why and this is where the laws came

238
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,720
from this is why the laws have to exist

239
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,609
why hacking legislation came in part of

240
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,260
the reason in these cases this is just

241
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,750
an example this is just the first one

242
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,790
that came up on my search the rest of

243
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,470
them there's a huge long list of

244
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,900
basically the exact same scenario

245
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,880
happening and courts not being able to

246
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,640
grapple with the fact that someone has

247
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,820
stolen data from somebody else using the

248
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,430
traditional law at the time so the law

249
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,930
that applies to avaaz or a car I've

250
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:44,109
couldn't apply to data that's why the

251
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,520
laws came in so the new laws on computer

252
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,230
data didn't apply to this case because

253
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,180
the time of the offense the new laws

254
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,450
came in in 2015 they cable got Royal

255
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,670
Assent at that time and this one

256
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,470
obviously didn't apply they dealt with

257
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,020
that at the hearing this guy basically

258
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:01,330
got off scot-free and as a side note the

259
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,740
laws regarding the distribution of

260
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,680
intimate images without somebody's

261
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,180
consent also did not apply to this case

262
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,859
because they were not enforced at the

263
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:14,979
time so this guy just got off scot-free

264
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,060
so you can imagine why we want to create

265
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:20,470
laws to protect people from these

266
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:22,869
scenarios and public sentiment has since

267
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,120
changed so the state of the law in

268
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,340
Canada right now and this is just me

269
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,040
kind of summarizing the slides we've

270
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,200
just gone over is if you hack into

271
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,469
someone's computer without their

272
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:39,220
permission even if their system is

273
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:41,890
horribly insecure even if they deserve

274
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,990
it because they should know better even

275
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,610
if they have a duty to secure that

276
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,480
network and protect people's data if you

277
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,230
hack into it

278
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:57,730
even to show the vulnerability

279
00:13:49,230 --> 00:14:00,520
you're breaking the law all right this

280
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:03,730
headline kills me absolutely ridiculous

281
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,350
place so but the point is the hacking is

282
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,520
being taken very seriously now it's an

283
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,770
evolution where we came from

284
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,230
the law old laws trying to grapple with

285
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,150
this new emerging issue laws now apply

286
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,060
to that issue because public sentiment

287
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:18,760
has changed based on the offensiveness

288
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,500
of those previous cases so public

289
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,670
sentiment now is holding that hacking is

290
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,230
very serious were all very concerned

291
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,490
about it you see news reports about a

292
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,140
breeze breach reports and all these

293
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,839
things and everybody is getting very up

294
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,600
in arms and very paranoid about it and

295
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,160
this may sound very extreme and I know

296
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,110
that some of you a problem have probably

297
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,199
experienced this in some way or another

298
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,839
but I mean consider this so the last

299
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,540
time I was here I was quite pregnant I

300
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,830
was very round I would kind of waddled

301
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,079
around I didn't get to drink at the

302
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:51,790
after party it was horrible but I'd

303
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:53,530
since given birth to to this I'm kidding

304
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,380
he's actually is actually way worse than

305
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:58,839
that no I love him he's fantastic but

306
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:01,350
when when I was giving birth I opted for

307
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:03,910
the epidural okay and I saw one of these

308
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,130
wonderful glorious beeping machines next

309
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,560
to me so I was hooked up to a drug

310
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:12,990
infusion pump that's what this is now an

311
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,989
epidural is generally a fentanyl drip

312
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:28,480
but the interesting thing is is that

313
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:30,190
this this drug was locked up it was

314
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,930
locked up and it was followed around by

315
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:34,089
nurses and every there was a chain of

316
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,579
custody for the fentanyl but the device

317
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:39,640
was left completely unlocked right this

318
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,050
is a locking there's old plexiglass lock

319
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,060
in case right the device was left

320
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,589
completely unlocked and it has an open

321
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,479
interface the one the model that was

322
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:49,870
next to me had a handy little USB port

323
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,130
on the other side of it and there have

324
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,390
been multiple researchers who have

325
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,390
gotten I've discovered that these

326
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:08,139
and mice my spouse who knows a lot about

327
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:09,490
these things I can talk about but he

328
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:11,079
knows about these things he felt it was

329
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:18,850
a very good time to talk to my Anessa

330
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:21,279
just about device security so but and

331
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,720
this is let me get to my point

332
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,410
under the current provisions of the

333
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,449
Criminal Code if you attempt to expose a

334
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:32,499
vulnerability and a device like this if

335
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:34,449
you do so without permission then you

336
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:36,249
are could you are potentially causing

337
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:37,930
harm to a person there's a risk that you

338
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:39,730
are causing harm you're causing genuine

339
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,439
risk to life think about it that if the

340
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,389
drip were some of the safeguards were

341
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:45,129
not going to didn't work okay and the

342
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:47,350
drip started running faster I would be

343
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:49,360
dead okay I would die for a fentanyl

344
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,579
overdose directly through directly to

345
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,350
your spine so there's a real risk here

346
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:56,559
and this is one of the things that when

347
00:16:53,350 --> 00:17:05,279
the public hears about this they freak

348
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:05,279
out and they feel very vulnerable and I

349
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:18,250
my previous my previous talks conference

350
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:24,579
and so causing direct harm in terms of

351
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:26,949
what happens when you when you wasn't

352
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,990
wasn't cutting it that's basically what

353
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:30,539
why the law has changed okay a lot

354
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,770
needed to catch up with the fact that

355
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:35,799
simply accessing and disseminating

356
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:37,179
information was was a violation and it

357
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:40,059
eventually did that's why the change has

358
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:41,890
happened so because and part of that was

359
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,649
from the Ashley Madison hack because we

360
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:47,260
realized that people who are actually

361
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:49,239
deeply affected by their information

362
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:54,789
being released to people committed

363
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:56,950
suicide information was released you can

364
00:17:54,789 --> 00:18:08,140
imagine why this website where people

365
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:13,210
would but the

366
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:14,590
real risk now when this after this

367
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,510
happened and they started trying to find

368
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:19,990
the people who were who perpetrated this

369
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:22,210
attack the Toronto Police said

370
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,100
specifically this is a crime we're

371
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:26,650
coming after you it's very serious and

372
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,810
that was to their credit one of the

373
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,060
first times that they had actually come

374
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:32,919
out and said yes hacking is a crime it's

375
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:36,340
very serious it causes harm to people

376
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:38,740
we're coming after you now unfortunately

377
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,389
the practicality of finding these people

378
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,480
proved to be more difficult than they

379
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:44,800
could imagine ever happening and no

380
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,440
charges have even been laid in this

381
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:52,470
attack now other jurisdictions are also

382
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,830
heard of this one this was another

383
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:59,590
another teenager with like brains but no

384
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,870
common sense this type of situation so

385
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:20,470
this was an Australian teenager who

386
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:23,860
hacked into doing something wrong he

387
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:26,110
would have done something else but a

388
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,850
name the folder happy hack hack I mean

389
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:31,120
he wasn't exactly covering his trails

390
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:33,159
trail very well so he was he was caught

391
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,669
and he actually ended up pleading guilty

392
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,050
and because he was a minor and because

393
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,730
they didn't receive any actual harm

394
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:42,100
arising out of the release of the

395
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,290
information I think he really received

396
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,879
eight months of probation or something

397
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,950
like that probably community service

398
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:52,180
which I'm sure for a teenager is worse

399
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:54,010
than jail but anyway he did it didn't

400
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:56,230
end up so badly for him but the point is

401
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,640
is that it definitely could have because

402
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,380
a lot of this and a lot of our

403
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,110
perception and the reaction to these

404
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:05,620
these events depends on what actually

405
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:08,260
happens so if someone actually gets

406
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,969
harmed by the event then the response is

407
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,570
going to be switched and it's going to

408
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,290
be brutal

409
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,290
whereas

410
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,469
information you know maybe it's not all

411
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,570
that personal even if it is that

412
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:22,150
personal nothing bad happens then the

413
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:24,370
response is generally oh those hackers

414
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:26,320
and it doesn't and no one really pursues

415
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,330
it and that's partly because it's so

416
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,460
difficult to pursue these criminal cases

417
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,530
that and a lot of police departments

418
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,910
just don't have the resources to do that

419
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,418
we talked about that a little bit this

420
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:38,500
morning

421
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:40,120
ah which brings me to I mean the obvious

422
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:46,090
conclusion hacking is really illegal

423
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:48,250
this is just it's just but I mean we're

424
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,289
talking about something else other than

425
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,500
happy today we're talking about you

426
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:54,879
discovering a vulnerability and

427
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,549
disclosing it and that's where we need

428
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,440
to really drill into the provisions and

429
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:04,590
how you actually get caught by these

430
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,590
provisions and how you can how you can

431
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:13,780
get a free but there are two elements to

432
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:16,240
every crime okay there's the intent

433
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,610
element and there's the actual doing of

434
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,010
the crime okay your mens rea which is

435
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:25,270
your intent okay and the actus Reis

436
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:26,710
which is Latin for so and it's a

437
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,090
difference between just thinking about

438
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,070
doing something and actually doing it

439
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,939
and it's the difference between

440
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:33,639
accidentally doing something illegal

441
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,470
okay and intending to do something

442
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,929
illegal and all you need to know that

443
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,450
ignorance of the law is not an excuse

444
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:42,549
okay that's one of my favorite to tell

445
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,840
people just because you don't know what

446
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:45,580
the lie isn't just because you don't

447
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,949
know that it's a bad thing it doesn't

448
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,389
mean that it's not going to catch you so

449
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,620
that's not what I'm talking about here

450
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,929
I'm talking about actually having to

451
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,449
form the intent to do something and that

452
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:57,610
is an element of a criminal offense if

453
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,799
that's not there if the intent isn't

454
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:02,289
there then you can't be caught but

455
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:03,820
whatever the criminal provision is okay

456
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:06,549
and the classic example is breaking into

457
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,260
a car okay so we've got mobile guy

458
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:09,879
thinking about it intending to do it and

459
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:13,539
the difference between him actually

460
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:15,520
doing it so this is an important

461
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:18,760
distinction we talk about the the W gang

462
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,250
q okay he access information that didn't

463
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,480
belong to him that he shouldn't have had

464
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,690
access to

465
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,640
but did his activities if his actions

466
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:33,940
rise to the level of criminal activity

467
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:37,180
and I mean short answer no the intent

468
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:39,550
element of the anti hacking provision of

469
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:41,830
the criminal code is fraudulently and

470
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:45,700
without color of Rights that one up on

471
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:47,830
the top there and fraud fraud is exactly

472
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:51,700
what you think it is okay so it's a

473
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:53,530
deliberate deceit or falsehood and color

474
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,020
of right is something that's a little

475
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:59,530
bit more obscure but it's basically

476
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:02,379
having an honest belief that you have

477
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:07,120
the right to in this case access or use

478
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:09,100
a computer or computer system even if

479
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:14,770
there's no basis in law for that honest

480
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:18,820
belief you have to have now that's kind

481
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:21,550
of a it's a difficult concept to work

482
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,889
your way around there there are multiple

483
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:25,980
cases on people there's there's a case

484
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:30,100
actually where a woman was held

485
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:32,830
regarding it was I think it was her a

486
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,870
relative of hers she bludgeoned them to

487
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:37,240
death because she thought that they were

488
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,280
they were killing her infant they were

489
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,390
kind of hunched over she came in and

490
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,020
they were kind of hunched over the

491
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:46,330
infant and she hit them with a shovel or

492
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,940
something they died immediately and she

493
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:50,560
actually was not found guilty because

494
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,910
she didn't have the intent to kill

495
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,970
someone what she had the intent to do

496
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:56,770
was to defend her child so she couldn't

497
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:59,080
because she didn't have to do that so

498
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,550
that's how powerful the distinction is

499
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:07,060
and that's how powerful the actual

500
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:10,450
intent element of an offense is so but

501
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:12,909
it does not include a mere belief in a

502
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:16,810
moral entitlement to something so I

503
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:18,910
can't say well that's mine so mine so

504
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:22,570
I'm not stealing it from you that's not

505
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:27,270
how this works it has to be and for in

506
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:27,270
this context because you think

507
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,000
because stupid them that's not at work

508
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:35,610
so moral entitlement doesn't get you

509
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,509
there and the axe is the action elements

510
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:41,158
of this offense are in a B C and D all

511
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:42,470
right we don't need to talk about those

512
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,880
right now we've already reviewed those

513
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:47,370
so let's take a look at this in the

514
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,389
context of the W get kid all right

515
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:55,439
so did he obtain computer service he did

516
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:57,928
right okay he the the computer system

517
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,149
was a datastore and client portal okay

518
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:03,450
he accessed it when he access the stored

519
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:04,918
information he obtained the service I'm

520
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:08,610
still this is up for debate this is only

521
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:10,230
my interpretation of what happened did

522
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:12,600
he intercept any function of a computer

523
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:14,909
system well yeah he did storage system

524
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:18,178
he access the story data he intercepted

525
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:20,669
that function that's more although that

526
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:29,340
second one I I've given some thought to

527
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:31,799
that and I'm not so sure but he so he

528
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:34,678
used he also arguably used a computer

529
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:36,210
system to obtain or intercept so once

530
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:40,820
you realize that he could access the

531
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:45,450
information he continued to do that and

532
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:47,460
so he he had the the action of intent of

533
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,110
getting that information but he also had

534
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:52,559
the intent of getting the information so

535
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:54,299
certain elements of it are are there and

536
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,980
but this this wasn't related to

537
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,570
passwords so we'll just kind of leave

538
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,399
that off to the side but he did he did

539
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:02,610
technically have access to the system as

540
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:06,239
far as my understanding pathway so but

541
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:08,668
then the question is was it fraudulent

542
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:15,840
or was it without color of right and

543
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:21,080
that's where okay and I don't think that

544
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:23,360
it was because remember that fraud is a

545
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,309
deliberate falsehood

546
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,969
he changed the end of the URL to access

547
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:36,010
the information it wasn't that much of a

548
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:38,590
change he thought that he had

549
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:40,750
to the information right so he just

550
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:43,870
assumed and the same argument goes for

551
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,610
the color of right issue here the color

552
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:47,918
of right element so he had an honest

553
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:51,668
belief that he had the right to use the

554
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:57,450
computer system to discover that he

555
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:57,450
could access other doesn't mean that he

556
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:55,450
doesn't but the point is that it's not

557
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:56,889
obvious that he didn't I mean okay so

558
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:01,200
this is a graphical representation and

559
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:01,200
what actually happened my opinion forged

560
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:08,139
so but so honestly though the whole

561
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:13,090
story made me really sad I mean he's a

562
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:21,280
young guy were you an adult when you

563
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:24,600
were 19 I was but it made me sad because

564
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:34,660
young kid and he's got enough knowledge

565
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:37,860
of computers and natural curiosity

566
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,860
overtook him

567
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:47,899
20 but I mean I hope what happened was

568
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:50,090
is that he did this he did the seemingly

569
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:53,120
innocent activity and then he had the

570
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:57,379
whole weight of the state coming down on

571
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,959
him his home was searched he was charged

572
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:02,180
with a criminal offense the charges were

573
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,130
dropped but he still had that prospect

574
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:07,780
standing in front of him he would have

575
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:13,670
been advised by whoever his lawyer was

576
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:17,629
that he had the he had the potential for

577
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:18,170
jail time for prison time okay that's

578
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:22,700
scary

579
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:26,540
that's scary for anybody I hope that he

580
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:31,960
has enough self-esteem or teenage ego to

581
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,960
get over this event and to keep doing

582
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:50,629
it's enough to scare somebody away so

583
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,460
that's the criminal side of things and

584
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,210
the reason I like to deal with that

585
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,610
first

586
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,980
is because the criminal elements of

587
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:59,959
these these offenses and criminal

588
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:03,920
elements of hacking and wife and how

589
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:07,760
that relates to is important because it

590
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:11,930
informs the civil side of this issue

591
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,430
okay so let's talk about the civil

592
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:16,100
liability so the general principle is

593
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:19,130
that if you're a manufacturer you are

594
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,209
liable for any issues with your product

595
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:30,820
we're not going to talk about that in

596
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:34,010
detail today how we deal with

597
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,840
manufacturer liability in relation to

598
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:39,920
products is it direct it's not like

599
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:43,189
making a car cars cars they interface

600
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,570
with other software and it's they're

601
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:49,930
kind of just a one-off thing

602
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:52,000
whereas interact with multiple other

603
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:53,620
software products right so

604
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,590
it's more complicated that's just one

605
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,780
example so we don't quite know how

606
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:01,659
manufacturers liability works I mean we

607
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,610
have we have some cases and the law has

608
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,920
been working on it but for the most part

609
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:08,530
it's still kind of a wild west and

610
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:11,550
relative to two more established legal

611
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:14,010
concepts but what that means is that

612
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:20,649
manufacturers feel pretty vulnerable

613
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:23,620
about their security another reason why

614
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:25,960
they overreact and freak out because

615
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,370
they they don't quite know how these

616
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:32,500
vulnerabilities will be held they don't

617
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:34,570
know the law it would if someone came to

618
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:41,020
me and said hey look this person came to

619
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:43,240
us they've security I would I would have

620
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:45,540
to do some research to fully answer

621
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,800
their question I practice in this area

622
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:51,850
okay so he really is it's more

623
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:55,570
complicated and people think so you all

624
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:57,399
know the situation okay you've got you

625
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:59,350
you're reporting to either manufacturer

626
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,470
or an organization that there's a

627
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:03,990
security vulnerability find something

628
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:08,050
whether you went looking for it or not

629
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:09,910
you found it and now how do you deal

630
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:14,530
with it and so when it comes to

631
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:15,790
disclosure or dissemination of security

632
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,800
vulnerabilities you have two basic

633
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:20,440
options you the in house option where

634
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,690
you go directly to the company and you

635
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,030
deal with it privately and then you have

636
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,640
the public option where you deal with

637
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:30,700
this by disseminating the information

638
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:43,030
broadly on forums you to prove concept

639
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:45,490
videos now pride but there when you do

640
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:48,220
something publicly the implications are

641
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:50,620
a little bit different and I can't

642
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:52,480
really talk about that right now in

643
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:54,669
detail because that was the part of the

644
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,620
presentation that when I started looking

645
00:32:54,670 --> 00:33:00,809
at it I was like holy crap this is very

646
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:02,459
complicated and and it's multifaceted

647
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:04,168
gauging issues of freedom of speech or

648
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,870
engaging issues of copyright defamation

649
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:08,820
and all these things so what I want to

650
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:11,809
address specifically just so that we

651
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:14,490
don't end up having a conversation about

652
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:16,350
broad strokes of nothing I want to do

653
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:18,809
specifically with the with the private

654
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:21,480
disclosure okay and what happens when

655
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:23,249
you disclose them to a company so

656
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,230
choosing between the options is

657
00:33:23,249 --> 00:33:28,049
difficult because there's no there's no

658
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,429
so-called ethical tradition for hackers

659
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:32,690
I know that some of you have your own

660
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:35,669
ethical codes but in relative to other

661
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:38,879
professions you actually are somewhat

662
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:46,230
ad-hoc and that's that's kind of

663
00:33:38,879 --> 00:33:50,939
frightening because there are courses

664
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:53,999
that you how you should handle these

665
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,529
things but you don't have strict codes

666
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:57,059
of conduct you may have a code of

667
00:33:55,529 --> 00:34:00,149
conduct with your employer you may have

668
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:02,789
internal office policies but and I don't

669
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:05,428
use this term but it's kind of a Wild

670
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:08,639
West for you guys as well because there

671
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:11,159
isn't a whole lot of actual strict

672
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,659
requirements for how to handle these

673
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:16,020
situations so that's that's where people

674
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:17,730
get into trouble so what happens in

675
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:21,540
these situations because you guys don't

676
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:27,960
have any clear code of conduct then when

677
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:29,520
these people don't know how to react and

678
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,339
when people don't know how to react and

679
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,859
they don't have a strict okay we do a B

680
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:54,659
and C then what they do is they go to a

681
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:57,990
legal remedy people don't have but la is

682
00:34:54,659 --> 00:35:01,530
a really crappy mechanism for handling

683
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:04,649
these types of things it is slow it is

684
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:08,250
slow to adapt and it is to be honest

685
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:11,760
with you really really bad at adapting

686
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:13,990
it's just bad so I'm gonna go back to

687
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,840
2011 okay this was

688
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:19,618
situation so first super state super is

689
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,460
a superannuation firm financial firm

690
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:23,650
what happened why is that person

691
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,030
discovered that you can see other

692
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,560
people's information just by changing

693
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,040
your elements you were logged into the

694
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:35,320
system

695
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:38,050
sounds familiar rising and they said

696
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,460
they said this person who discovered and

697
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:42,040
it slows the vulnerability to them an

698
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:44,830
angry letter don't read that don't read

699
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,900
it I'll read it for you okay so to

700
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:49,630
summarize there were various threats in

701
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,369
letter ok there's criminal criminal

702
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:54,970
threats so we're going to report you

703
00:35:51,369 --> 00:36:04,090
this is American I know you're all

704
00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:08,709
reading it so it's jail ok threaten and

705
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:10,480
civil suits ok and they said look we're

706
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:13,480
gonna make you pay for all of our legal

707
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,570
fees in relation to this and we want

708
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,100
your computer and no more access for you

709
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,230
you're not accessing our system anymore

710
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:22,540
you've breached our Terms of Service by

711
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,790
even reporting missing to us by exposing

712
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:26,670
this vulnerability and we're really

713
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:29,350
really mad

714
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:31,900
so the person who received this letter

715
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:33,790
in spite the fact that he or she made

716
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:36,790
the disclosure in good faith and that's

717
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:40,630
a magic word here for the purpose of

718
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:47,350
improving security okay and letters like

719
00:36:40,630 --> 00:37:00,850
this companies to reward people who

720
00:36:47,350 --> 00:37:04,868
voluntarily but there's real value in

721
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:08,230
having all these people working on a

722
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:10,480
volunteer basis for free to define these

723
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:12,400
security vulnerabilities ok

724
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,440
but the problem is and that's greater

725
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,330
than anything and that's that seems to

726
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,369
be the way things are going but that's

727
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:21,690
not that's not a standard they're not

728
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:21,690
required to react that way

729
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:30,150
raises and unfortunately people react

730
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:34,440
like this there's people who pay you and

731
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:36,390
thank you freak out and call your lawyer

732
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:41,430
okay and there's nothing there's nothing

733
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:46,828
requiring one or stopping the other so

734
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:52,319
how do you protect yourself so hacking

735
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:58,200
is legal as long as it's performed with

736
00:37:52,319 --> 00:38:14,359
the permission okay

737
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:17,879
now whether or not those definitions

738
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:24,779
inform what your civil liability would

739
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:28,380
be if you're having permission now mid

740
00:38:24,779 --> 00:38:36,109
courses teach methods and many of these

741
00:38:28,380 --> 00:39:06,029
certifications like CISSP have have

742
00:38:36,109 --> 00:39:09,690
codes and policies but it also is a

743
00:39:06,029 --> 00:39:12,920
registered trademark okay and that means

744
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:12,920
something that's actually the power

745
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:32,980
beans is that it's more it's a brand

746
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:36,529
okay so the Canadian trade mark for

747
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:38,840
CISSP was filed in 2003 by the

748
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:42,410
International information system

749
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:44,000
security certification consortium Inc

750
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:50,870
which kind of makes them sound like

751
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:52,340
their CEO looks like this but it was

752
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:54,140
registered in relationship specific

753
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,940
services okay and these services are the

754
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:57,500
provision of every don't read that the

755
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:01,490
provision of information security by

756
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:02,770
professionals certified by ISC and the

757
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:05,029
development and implementation of

758
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,530
strategies and policies related to

759
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:09,260
information security okay that sounds

760
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:10,670
like good stuff that's fair but this was

761
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,110
registered and this is where this is

762
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,820
where we really dig into the

763
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:17,600
nitty-gritty of this this was registered

764
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:19,790
as a certification mark okay and a

765
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:24,230
certification mark is a special kind of

766
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:28,450
trademark and in Canada that means that

767
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:33,290
it's connected basically with a set of

768
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:35,419
rules that in order for the anyone who

769
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:37,160
wants to use that logo in order for them

770
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:39,700
to use it they have to follow those set

771
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:44,029
of rules okay they're basically

772
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:49,480
licensing that trademark that trademark

773
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:49,480
term that trademark logo in order to

774
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,950
basically give themselves authority okay

775
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,410
so this so in order to have a

776
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:59,839
certification mark we've got character

777
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:02,359
quality conditions our class of persons

778
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:05,210
in a specific area that is PO that in so

779
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,660
it's a gatekeeping function okay that's

780
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,390
what it is

781
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:10,339
all it is is a certification mark is in

782
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:13,549
order for you to advertise yourself as

783
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:15,290
cissp you need to have these you need to

784
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:16,550
be certified by us then you're licensed

785
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:18,500
by us you need to comply with our

786
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,730
policies okay but that's not really a

787
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:24,890
shield that's not a lot of protection

788
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:28,040
for you okay CSP is a brand it is not

789
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:32,060
legislation okay and here's where I'm

790
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:33,830
not bragging example lawyers are a

791
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:36,560
creature of legislation okay lawyers

792
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:38,910
have a legislated monopoly where we're

793
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,670
the only ones who can practice law

794
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:43,859
and in exchange for that we have a very

795
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,510
specific set of rules that we have to

796
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:46,619
follow and those rules are codified and

797
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:49,859
lock okay

798
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:52,859
that's creature of legislation and these

799
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:54,450
rules are very clear okay and if you

800
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:57,319
don't follow them you're out right you

801
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:59,399
get disbarred you guys don't have that

802
00:41:57,319 --> 00:42:00,720
what you have is you have a

803
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,010
certification mark that doesn't mean you

804
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,259
don't have any protection because what

805
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:06,750
the certification mark has done is it

806
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,609
has allowed the development of an

807
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:10,740
industry standard I'm not talking just

808
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:12,839
about cissp okay I'm talking about the

809
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,669
fact that your industry is gaining more

810
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:18,538
of an identity and as you gain an

811
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:21,270
identity you set up standard practices

812
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:22,559
that you all agree or maybe debate on

813
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:24,690
the finer points of but you set up

814
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,849
general practices that you all agree are

815
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:28,619
the best practices okay and those things

816
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:32,150
are powerful industry standards are what

817
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:35,970
protect you because in a negligence suit

818
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:39,599
the question really boils down to did

819
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:42,450
you comply with industry standards if

820
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:45,930
you did it's less likely you're gonna be

821
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:48,509
found liable if you didn't then you're

822
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,890
in real hot water so what does this all

823
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,150
mean I'm gonna try and round it up into

824
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:53,520
some questions and a case study so

825
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:54,960
really quick rapid-fire I'm an employee

826
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,910
I discovered and disclosed a

827
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,480
vulnerability to a third party not my

828
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:02,700
employer can I be fired the easy answer

829
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,260
is yes you can be fired for off-duty

830
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:08,788
activities so if you expose a

831
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:11,099
vulnerability okay and that third party

832
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:13,980
company gets pissed off they contact

833
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:16,079
your employer they can fire you it's

834
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,940
actually really hard to do it is

835
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,890
difficult to fire somebody for their

836
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,140
off-duty activities but if those

837
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:24,270
activities are found to endanger the

838
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:26,339
reputation of the company then it's more

839
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:28,500
likely that you could be fired so next

840
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:30,450
one I'm an individual I discovered and

841
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,130
disclosed a vulnerability to a third

842
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,049
party without permission you actually

843
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:36,210
found it without actually asking their

844
00:43:34,049 --> 00:43:38,520
permission can I be sued and the answer

845
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:40,289
is yes and we have a new torch it

846
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,549
started in Ontario it's since made its

847
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:44,220
way to Nova Scotia it's the tort of

848
00:43:41,549 --> 00:43:48,690
invasion of privacy okay and basically

849
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:50,009
if you and it doesn't only apply it to

850
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:53,650
computer

851
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:56,980
but if your conduct is intentional okay

852
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:58,990
in accessing the information if you

853
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,910
invaded without lawful justification

854
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:03,160
right we're to going into that that

855
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:05,890
color of right element the private

856
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,899
affairs are concerns of somebody and if

857
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:11,859
the a reasonable person would find that

858
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:13,990
invasion highly offensive then you could

859
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,790
be found liable under this tort now this

860
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:17,109
short is very limited because obviously

861
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:19,300
this could apply to all sorts of

862
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:20,770
situations it's limited to the personal

863
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,900
information that's that a reasonable

864
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:24,150
person would feel very violated if it

865
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:28,090
were released so financial information

866
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:30,250
sexual information like private diaries

867
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:32,260
that are you know a little bit more than

868
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:34,510
I love so and so hard hard hard a little

869
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,670
bit more than that but the damages in

870
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:39,760
this tort are quite real they go to a

871
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:41,500
maximum of twenty thousand dollars okay

872
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,030
and that's punitive damages that's aside

873
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:46,030
from the damages if somebody loses their

874
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:48,510
job then you have a wage loss claim okay

875
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:51,220
so the tort is actually quite serious

876
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:53,860
now I think it would be very difficult

877
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:56,230
practically and I searched and searched

878
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,610
and I couldn't find a single case that

879
00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:01,150
applies directly to what we're talking

880
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:02,290
about here in Canada but I think it

881
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:05,470
would be a very it would be very

882
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:07,570
difficult for somebody to find a person

883
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:09,310
who voluntarily disclose the security

884
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:11,050
vulnerability of for liable of that

885
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:13,210
torrent will be difficult but still it's

886
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:15,430
there and the point is is that we don't

887
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:17,920
know and when we don't know we have to

888
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:21,730
exercise extreme caution because the

889
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,440
consequences can be very real okay so

890
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:24,910
another one I'm self-employed I

891
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,440
discovered his close vulnerability to a

892
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:28,120
third party not like I cannae me see the

893
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,440
answer is yes just like before you can

894
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,850
either be sued individually or if you

895
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,760
have a company your company can be sued

896
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:35,980
but if you if you're incorporated and

897
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,650
you're you're practicing your trade

898
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,790
under an incorporated entity you can

899
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:43,120
still be found liable for criminal

900
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:43,690
activity personally okay so let's do a

901
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,580
case study

902
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:48,360
I'm kind of running out of time but but

903
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:51,460
I really want to talk about this so I

904
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:53,620
know so this is an actual so I don't

905
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,240
know this person who is the subject of

906
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:58,839
this case study maybe in the audience

907
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:00,970
today this actually happened so what

908
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,250
what occurred was my client was having a

909
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:03,290
house

910
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:04,910
built he logged into the builders online

911
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:06,650
portal and notice that he could view

912
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:10,299
other customers information just by

913
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:14,750
changing the URL sounds familiar right

914
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:16,790
and what so they they basically accused

915
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:18,860
him of hacking into their system and

916
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:21,980
probably pictured him in a hoodie typing

917
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:23,120
away in the dark but so they requested

918
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,530
the return of all of the information

919
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:27,920
don't bother reading that's a lot of

920
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:30,590
text I'm and all the downloaded all the

921
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:34,370
downloaded material and they also wanted

922
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:37,010
proof to their satisfaction that he had

923
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:39,859
removed all of the information from any

924
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:41,090
other machine okay which it's like how

925
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:44,450
do you do that you prove a negative it's

926
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:46,010
really difficult and they also barred

927
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:48,379
this person from accessing their site so

928
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:51,230
they denied them that the use of that

929
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:53,420
service anymore so I'm a professional I

930
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,920
know that I'm I get a bit goofy at this

931
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:57,340
conference but I like to think that I

932
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:59,660
conduct myself very professionally and

933
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:05,530
everything but when I get a letter like

934
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:11,629
this my reaction is like this okay now

935
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:14,390
because we couldn't email this photo we

936
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:15,860
sent a letter okay and by the way I

937
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:18,080
should say that I have this person's

938
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:21,010
consent to to tell you about this but I

939
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:24,020
still I've kept their name private

940
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:28,370
necessarily so don't read that letter

941
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:31,220
because you might find typos but so this

942
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:32,980
in this letter we we basically said look

943
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,939
your website was inherently insecure

944
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:37,490
okay that's your fault

945
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:40,430
you had no security protocols preventing

946
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:41,660
access to between user accounts so once

947
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:44,600
somebody was logged in they can go

948
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:46,819
around and look at everybody that my

949
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:49,040
client access the information really to

950
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:51,590
confirm the vulnerability so he

951
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,090
suspected it and then he accessed the

952
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:55,130
information of who confirmed that the

953
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:57,440
information was not his okay

954
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:59,750
the client was an authorized user of the

955
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,060
site so he didn't have there was no user

956
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:03,890
turn preventing him from changing the

957
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:06,080
URL that was a little bit crappy

958
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:09,020
sometimes you throw these things in and

959
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:13,190
see how they go and also the client felt

960
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:14,690
an ethical obligation to to prove that

961
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,970
that vulnerability to figure

962
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:18,740
it's extent in order to fully disclose

963
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:24,950
it to that person so he was acting in

964
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:26,660
good faith and also I also pointed out

965
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:28,759
the irony of the situation and that if

966
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:31,460
he if he couldn't if he if he hadn't

967
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,960
disclosed it to you then using his

968
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:35,200
professional knowledge that he was now

969
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,210
being punished for then somebody else

970
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:40,069
may have with a nefarious purpose may

971
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,900
have used that exploit to gain access to

972
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:43,609
intensely personal information so

973
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:46,609
private information financial

974
00:48:43,609 --> 00:48:48,920
information right house building company

975
00:48:46,609 --> 00:48:51,609
so they would have information on income

976
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:54,140
they would have bank account information

977
00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:56,150
they would have all sorts of information

978
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,650
on family status they would have all of

979
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:59,030
that information be due because of the

980
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:02,990
financing involved in building a house

981
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:04,579
so he was helping them and they came

982
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:06,799
down on him like a ton of bricks or at

983
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:08,660
least they thought they were so we said

984
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:13,270
we sent this letter on and then in

985
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:16,790
response nothing okay and part of that

986
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:19,250
part of that is because actually

987
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:20,569
bringing these things forward so in in

988
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:22,369
every interview legal issue there's

989
00:49:20,569 --> 00:49:25,069
multiple stages one of the stages is the

990
00:49:22,369 --> 00:49:28,250
lawyers posture at each other and use

991
00:49:25,069 --> 00:49:30,650
big words very scary letterhead and but

992
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:32,270
moving beyond that in these types of

993
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:35,030
claims is actually really complicated

994
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:37,250
and it's not only complicated it's

995
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:39,740
incredibly expensive and where there are

996
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:43,369
very limited damages it is almost never

997
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:44,750
worth it so although you get these

998
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:47,660
letters and please I'm not gonna say

999
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:52,960
don't respond to them because not

1000
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:52,960
responding is usually worse than but

1001
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:57,710
usually they don't go that far as long

1002
00:49:55,910 --> 00:50:00,200
as there are very limited damages as

1003
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:02,900
long as the company can prove that they

1004
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:05,000
they did there they're covering their

1005
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:09,560
ass exercise okay

1006
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:12,050
and kind of moved on but the point

1007
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,849
remains that that tort is available okay

1008
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:17,839
so the tort of invasion of privacy and

1009
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:20,630
also any criminal liability that you may

1010
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:22,490
have is there it's entirely possible

1011
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:24,170
that they can call the cops it's

1012
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:25,470
entirely possible that they could start

1013
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:28,470
a lawsuit against you

1014
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:29,730
and even if claims even if reports to

1015
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:32,368
the police are completely groundless

1016
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:37,130
even if a lawsuit is completely

1017
00:50:32,369 --> 00:50:37,130
frivolous you still have to deal with it

1018
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:45,029
now inside note these people gave no

1019
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:47,490
confirmation of whether or not they that

1020
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:50,640
what they call the breach was disclosed

1021
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:53,879
to to their patrons so they're bad kids

1022
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,150
for pretty sure so this this bingo is my

1023
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:59,099
favorite thing I found it on the

1024
00:50:56,150 --> 00:51:01,500
Internet so when you disclose a

1025
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:03,180
vulnerability that you've discovered

1026
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:05,640
you've discovered off the clock you are

1027
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:15,330
taking a significant risk because one of

1028
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:17,970
the items on this bingo and maybe your

1029
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:20,069
insurance if you have insurance will

1030
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:21,450
protect you but are you sure that you've

1031
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:24,510
complied with all of the industry

1032
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:26,430
standards are you sure that your

1033
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:27,780
insurance will cover you if you're off

1034
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:29,940
the clock many of you have insurance

1035
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:31,260
through your employers will your

1036
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:33,089
insurance cover you if you're off the

1037
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,560
clock do you really want to explain this

1038
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:36,450
to the police do you really want to

1039
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:39,450
explain this to your employer probably

1040
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:42,000
not but the reality is is that when you

1041
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:46,919
discover a vulnerability and you're off

1042
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,020
the clock it's not your job and you

1043
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:51,720
don't have permission to be poking

1044
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:53,400
around in the first place

1045
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,730
you're you're putting yourself at the

1046
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:59,310
mercy of the reaction of the person who

1047
00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:01,440
has this who owns the system completely

1048
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:05,670
at their mercy okay and without any

1049
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:07,650
solid protection and at the mercy of

1050
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:09,990
multiple areas of law and legal

1051
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:12,330
principles that were created prior to

1052
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:19,169
the internet okay because we're dealing

1053
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:21,390
mostly with old legal concepts you're at

1054
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:22,710
significant risk and we do many of these

1055
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:25,859
situations we don't know how to handle

1056
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:27,780
them yet which leads me to my most

1057
00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:30,348
succinct takeaway ever from any talk

1058
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,349
I've ever done

1059
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:40,610
okay all right that's it that's my time

1060
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,610
thank you everybody

1061
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:44,270
[Applause]
