1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,049
okay so please join me welcome to the

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:18,359
stage thank you hi so um I've been

3
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,448
working on this Internet policy and

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,609
regulation stuff since like 2002 when

5
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,529
the big issue was whether Napster should

6
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,900
be liable for the things its users did

7
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,670
and back then I struggled to convey to

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,399
skeptics that the outcome of the Napster

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,140
fight was about more than music it was

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,239
about whether the network would someday

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,370
grow to be a planetary scale nervous

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,440
system for our species or would be

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,190
regulated like it was a troublesome

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,800
jukebox but then as the years went by

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,750
something changed people woke up to the

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,940
fact that the internet was not just a

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,239
glorified video on-demand service or a

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,489
tool for recruiting jihadi fighters they

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,828
saw that the internet was a tool that

20
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,129
had become essential to our family lives

21
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,110
to our romance lives to our education to

22
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,600
our employment to our political and

23
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,060
civic engagement to our play and to our

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,520
business that doesn't mean that we can't

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,049
hope to regulate it wisely but it does

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,350
mean that we need to regulate it

27
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,909
carefully with gravitas and a sense that

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,830
a misstep could have unintended

29
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,799
consequences that rippled out in many

30
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,259
unexpected domains and I started to hold

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,630
out hope that we would begin to reverse

32
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,579
some of our earlier stupider mistakes

33
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,229
back when we thought that the internet

34
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,500
might just be a better pornography

35
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:37,320
distribution system like the digital

36
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,970
omnium Copyright Act in the US which was

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,889
then implemented in law Hill here

38
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,640
through Bill c35 under the Tories

39
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,720
shepherded in by James Moore and Tony

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,530
Clement so these are rules that ban

41
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,689
circumventing any kind of copyright

42
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,899
protection system now they were

43
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:57,960
originally designed to add weight legal

44
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,689
weight to otherwise very flimsy

45
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,839
technical measures like region coding on

46
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,820
DVD players after all it's not a

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,280
copyright infringement to go to another

48
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,079
country and buy a DVD and then go

49
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,819
watch it that's like the literal

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,080
opposite of a copyright infringement

51
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,730
that's what you're supposed to do under

52
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,230
copyright you go and you buy a creative

53
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,819
work at the price the rights holder it's

54
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,100
that and then you enjoy it in the

55
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,720
customary way and so if they were going

56
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,269
to enforce something like region coding

57
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,060
and stop manufacturers from making kits

58
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,400
2d regionalize your DVD players they

59
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,819
would need some legal measures to

60
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,319
prevent you from from doing this and

61
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,880
that's where we get the Digital

62
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,619
Millennium Copyright Act and his sister

63
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,690
laws around the world laws that ban

64
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,330
breaking copyright systems copyright

65
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,130
protection systems even when you're not

66
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,989
doing so to enable a copyright

67
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,760
infringement and that sounds like a

68
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:50,790
nuisance when we're talking about DVD

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,280
players but as time went on software the

70
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,769
copyrighted work started to infiltrate

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,540
every category of device and we started

72
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:00,239
to see these anti-circumvention rules

73
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,609
covering on an expanding constellation

74
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,220
of device types from implanted

75
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,170
defibrillators to cars to thermostats to

76
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,090
coffee makers to tractors to voting

77
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,309
machines now these laws were an

78
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,709
attractive nuisance they promised

79
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:17,040
manufacturers that they needed only to

80
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:19,140
configure their devices in such a way so

81
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,350
that the law would bind their customers

82
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,869
to conduct their affairs to benefit the

83
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,810
manufacturers shareholders even when it

84
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,549
ran contrary to the users own interests

85
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,410
that they could force you to buy ink

86
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,350
from them at a price that exceeded that

87
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,570
of vintage volley Cliquot or only get

88
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,070
your car or your phone service from an

89
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,600
authorized service center that could

90
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,549
decide how much to charge you and

91
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,108
whether your device was repairable at

92
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:45,180
all or whether it needed to be thrown

93
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:47,220
away and replaced so that you could they

94
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,140
could generate another sale so

95
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,510
manufacturers when they woke up to the

96
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,589
fact that they had copyrighted works in

97
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,500
their devices and they could use

98
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,989
anti-circumvention law to control their

99
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,549
users conduct they basically bootstrap

100
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,680
this into a new doctrine that's become

101
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:04,500
something like a felony contempt of

102
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,450
business model statute and we're still

103
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,390
from the perspective of people here is

104
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,940
that these laws also Chile researchers

105
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,920
because if in order to do a pen test or

106
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,630
report and disclose a vulnerability and

107
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,219
release release proof of concept code

108
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,469
you'd have to go past one of these

109
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,750
copyright logs you commit a potential

110
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,460
felony and in the u.s. that felony

111
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,350
he's a five-year prison sentence and a

112
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,750
five hundred thousand dollar fine for a

113
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,700
first offense and what this has the

114
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,160
effect of is turning every device into a

115
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,080
reservoir of long live Digital pathogens

116
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,330
that good guys know about but can't

117
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,469
report and bad guys know about and can

118
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:43,950
exploit that will as the years went by

119
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,930
and more people got online our network

120
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,849
policy started to touch more corners of

121
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,670
our lives the absurdity of using

122
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,890
copyright law a regulation intended to

123
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:55,440
set the parameters for the entertainment

124
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:58,320
industry to regulate this Universal

125
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,390
network became more absurd to more

126
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,280
people and it seemed like we were ready

127
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:05,070
for a change and I began to hold out

128
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,140
hope but then the last year happened it

129
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,090
has been a nano horriblest for

130
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,219
technology policy it has been a

131
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,380
nightmare assault a blitzkrieg of

132
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,419
terrible network policies swiftly

133
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,150
ushered into law with little or no

134
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:20,849
public debate and in the very worst of

135
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,190
bad faith from the Australian rules

136
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,410
banning working cryptography to the

137
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,719
American attack on online discussions of

138
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,640
sex and sexuality to the European

139
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,520
mandate for copyright filters for all

140
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,430
media types video audio text and other

141
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,190
communications to the Prost Prost post

142
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,590
Christchurch shooting global initiatives

143
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,479
requiring online platforms to remove

144
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,210
terrorists and other illegal content

145
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,030
without any chance for human review past

146
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:51,180
or pending now in Australia the EU and

147
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:54,090
in the UK we are living through a

148
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,250
real-time high-speed china fication of

149
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,169
the Western Internet where our networks

150
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,120
are being subject to surveillance and

151
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:02,250
control that has not been dreamt of

152
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,470
since the age in which every country had

153
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:07,110
one state-owned phone company that knew

154
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:09,450
everything everyone was doing but unlike

155
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,010
those days the phones are in our pockets

156
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,050
and they're always on and they're in

157
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:15,260
possession of every intimate secret of

158
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,400
our lives and unlike those days

159
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,550
authoritarians don't need to hire an

160
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,650
army of snoops to listen in on us the

161
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,690
algorithms can do the work for them and

162
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,549
I want to take a moment now just to

163
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,830
review what's happened in the last year

164
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,990
because the news comes at you fast and

165
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,270
the torrent of bad news has been roaring

166
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,530
past us let's start with the ban on

167
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,370
working crypto

168
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:40,260
since the late 1980s spies and cops have

169
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,360
been warning that everyday people should

170
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:45,210
not have access to working cryptography

171
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,390
until 1992 the US National Security

172
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:50,669
Agency treated crypto as ammunition and

173
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,440
imposed criminal penalties for anyone

174
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,240
trafficking and scrambling systems

175
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,210
stronger than a very weak cipher called

176
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,220
des 50 which the NSA said was too strong

177
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,870
for criminals to break but weak enough

178
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,140
for the police to break if they needed

179
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,480
to now in 1992 the nonprofit I work for

180
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,130
the Electronic Frontier Foundation

181
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,930
represented a UC Berkeley grad student

182
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,840
named Daniel J Bernstein who is today an

183
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:15,360
eminent cryptographer and he sued the US

184
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,489
government on his behalf now Bernstein

185
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,919
had been publishing strong ciphers on

186
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,480
Usenet an early messaging system that

187
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,849
was a precursor to the world wide web

188
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,290
zone message boards and we argued that

189
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:27,600
the American First Amendment that

190
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:29,820
protects free speech protected his right

191
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,470
to publish source code the source code

192
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,930
was a form of expressive speech under

193
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,940
the US Constitution and we won that suit

194
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,980
in the 9th circuit we wanted again in

195
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,450
the Appellate Division the NSA decided

196
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,250
not to try their luck at the Supreme

197
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,770
Court and this is why we have access to

198
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,900
strong cryptography today and today

199
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,299
every one of us use a strong crypto all

200
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,729
day long our devices encrypt everything

201
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,590
we save on them so that if we lose them

202
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:54,900
other people won't be able to access

203
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,369
that data and our networks automatically

204
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,349
encrypt everything we send over them

205
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,450
using crypto to limit who can access our

206
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,520
Wi-Fi networks to secure our Bluetooth

207
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:05,130
communications and to protect our data

208
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,870
as it traverses the public Internet when

209
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:09,090
your computer or your printer or your

210
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,220
pacemaker or your automobile receives an

211
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,840
operating system update this is

212
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,060
encrypted to prevent tampering and

213
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,890
cryptographic signatures are used to

214
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,660
validate the authenticity of the update

215
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:21,000
to prevent malicious actors from

216
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,140
compromising your systems by pushing bad

217
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,080
software to them

218
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,219
disguised as a manufacturer's update

219
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,469
crypto protects the integrity of your

220
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,570
data of your communications and of your

221
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,030
devices it's what stands between you and

222
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:35,039
identity theft and between you and

223
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:37,169
someone murdering you by compromising

224
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,150
your car's operating system or maybe the

225
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,059
operating system of your pacemaker and

226
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:44,390
modern cryptography is really strong

227
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,520
barring advances in quantum cryptography

228
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,010
properly

229
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,319
implementing crypto will can protect

230
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,970
your secrets forever by which I mean if

231
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,040
we convert all the hydrogen atoms in the

232
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,960
universe into computers and set them to

233
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,360
doing nothing but guessing what your key

234
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,790
is we run out of universe before we run

235
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,440
out of possible keys and that is great

236
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,150
news when it comes to protecting your

237
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,760
data and your person from malicious

238
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,800
attacks but authoritarians have never

239
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,500
given up on the project of banning

240
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,800
working crypto citing those Four

241
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:17,080
Horsemen of the information apocalypse

242
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,270
pedophiles terrorists criminals and drug

243
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,620
dealers as people who benefit from being

244
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,319
able to keep secrets from the

245
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,660
authorities and they insist despite all

246
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,630
evidence that it is possible to design

247
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,790
an encryption system that will protect

248
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:33,160
you from bad guys but will not protect

249
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,630
bad guys from them and when the former

250
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,490
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm

251
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:39,040
Turnbull was told that the laws of

252
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,680
mathematics said that we don't know how

253
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,900
to make crypto that's so strong that bad

254
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,270
guys can't break it but so weak the good

255
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,350
guys can he said literally the dumbest

256
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:50,140
thing anyone has ever said about

257
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:52,570
technology policy he said that the laws

258
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,030
of mathematics are very commendable but

259
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:58,500
I assure you that in Australia the laws

260
00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:02,050
of Australia are the laws of Australia

261
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,430
now you laugh but a year later the

262
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,560
Australian Parliament band working

263
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,569
cryptography and passed a mandate that

264
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,890
says the Australian government can go to

265
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,540
any manufacturer of a strong

266
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,890
cryptographic system and insist that

267
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,930
they deliberately weaken it by

268
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:16,270
introducing defects and pushing those

269
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:19,390
out to their users so that Australian

270
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:21,130
authorities can break working crypto so

271
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,930
that's the first horsemen in the

272
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,360
apocalypse and the first problems that

273
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,040
we've had with technology policy this

274
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,520
deliberate weakening of our internet

275
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,439
security but now let's talk about sex

276
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,270
the world's democracies integrated the

277
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,970
internet into their legal systems with

278
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:39,640
something called safe harbors these safe

279
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,500
harbors they say that you can provide a

280
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,660
platform for user speech and

281
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,060
communication and you don't have to spy

282
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,890
on everything your users say and do in

283
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,319
order to prevent them from saying bad

284
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,210
speech under Safe Harbor you aren't

285
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,770
liable for your users bad speech for

286
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,480
their copyright infringement for their

287
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,250
obscenity for their planning or

288
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,830
facilitating of criminal acts

289
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:02,500
and in return everyone who uses the

290
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,330
Internet gets a streamlined system to

291
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,280
remove things from the safe harbor if

292
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:09,130
you're a rights holder whose copyright

293
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:11,560
is infringed you can just send a letter

294
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:13,900
to an online service provider and say

295
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,939
this work infringes my copyright and

296
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,770
they take it down you don't have to go

297
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,760
to court you don't have to show evidence

298
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,530
you know when I worked in a

299
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,360
science-fiction book store in Toronto if

300
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,310
you thought that one of the books on our

301
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,080
shelves infringed your copyright you

302
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,729
didn't get to just walk into the

303
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,170
bookstore point at the minimum wage

304
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,420
clerk behind the counter and say I

305
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,310
insist that you remove that and expect

306
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,050
that the book would come down but on the

307
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,089
internet you can literally send an email

308
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,280
to a minimum wage employee in a data

309
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:41,950
center customer service center overseas

310
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,770
and they will facilitate the removal of

311
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:47,800
materials just on your say-so so safe

312
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,329
harbor allows for users to speak and it

313
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,900
allows for people who are grieved by

314
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:55,930
those users to remove that speech now in

315
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:58,990
the US safe harbors never extended to

316
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:01,270
protecting online service providers from

317
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:04,210
knowingly facilitating in sex

318
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:06,130
trafficking those sites could still be

319
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,380
held criminally and civilly

320
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:12,010
he knew that their users were engaged in

321
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,960
sex trafficking but despite this in 2018

322
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,120
the US Congress passed a law called

323
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,980
FASTA cesta depending on whether it's

324
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,800
the Senate or the Congress that was

325
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:23,170
supposed to prevent sex trafficking and

326
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,089
under this new law platforms are liable

327
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,430
for sex trafficking engaged in by their

328
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,890
users even if they don't know about it

329
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,140
in other words platforms have gained a

330
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,150
duty to police all sex related

331
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,449
conversations and discover whether

332
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:40,810
anyone in those discussions is is the

333
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:42,280
victim of non-consensual sex acts or is

334
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,530
engage is being set up for

335
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,839
non-consensual sex acts now this is a

336
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:49,240
duty that's very onerous and it's so

337
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,460
onerous that after this passed virtually

338
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,100
every service in the u.s. in which sex

339
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:57,370
related services are discussed or sold

340
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,410
was immediately shut down services just

341
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,060
couldn't take the chance that one in the

342
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,250
thousands or millions of discussions

343
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,010
taking place involves sex trafficking

344
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:08,380
and so a year later rather than people

345
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,880
being made safer sex workers are now

346
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,310
reporting that they face much more

347
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,430
violence because among the services that

348
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:17,439
got shut down in that great dragnet with

349
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,329
the services that sex user sex workers

350
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,060
used to discuss which clients were

351
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:24,270
unsafe and in order to and traded tips

352
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,979
to keep themselves safer which is why

353
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:29,260
pimping has made a giant comeback in the

354
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:32,710
United States because when we move sex

355
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,319
activities from private apartments where

356
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,420
clients are vetted using online services

357
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,630
to streetwalkers they need physical

358
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:43,300
security in the real world so sex has

359
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:46,930
become this go-to excuse for attacking

360
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:49,420
our privacy or enemity and our speech so

361
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:52,359
in the UK starting this July every

362
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,550
service that allows access to erotica or

363
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,190
pornography will have to register with

364
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,380
an age verification service before

365
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:02,770
allowing users access to adult content

366
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,240
and any uk-based adult site that doesn't

367
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,280
comply with this will face criminal and

368
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,110
civil sanctions while offshore sites

369
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,939
that fail to comply with this will be

370
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,400
blocked at the border thanks to the

371
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,590
British Great Firewall the national

372
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,930
firewall and these age checks will

373
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,640
require a credit card which means that

374
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,729
when these databases leak

375
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,260
and it's a matter of when not if

376
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,570
attackers will have access to a list of

377
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,880
the kinks and sexual fantasies of every

378
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,980
British consumer of pornography linked

379
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,930
to their financial data making it easy

380
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,540
to sort potential blackmail victims

381
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:39,370
according to their net worth right and

382
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:41,829
then there's tumblr Oh tumblr tumblr was

383
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,170
once a haven for sexual expression

384
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,300
including notably women's sexual

385
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,430
expression which is very absent from

386
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,650
mainstream pornographic sites as well as

387
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:54,579
sexual expression by people from sexual

388
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:55,660
minorities LGBTQ sexual minorities now

389
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,600
in 2018

390
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,610
after cesta FASTA passed Apple kicked

391
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,380
tumblr out of the App Store because they

392
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,240
couldn't take the risk that they would

393
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,820
be held liable under cesta FASTA and

394
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,670
tumblr responded by instituting a ban on

395
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,890
all adult content but because there is

396
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,449
no boiler room big enough to fill it

397
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:15,610
with prudes to look at everything every

398
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:18,100
tumblr user posts and delete it from the

399
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,660
service they built an automated machine

400
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,480
learning algorithm that could supposedly

401
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:25,329
detect porn and remove it but filters

402
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,100
their crude instruments these are all my

403
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,810
own tumblr posts that have been blocked

404
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,010
you'll note that among the posts that

405
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,560
have been blocked they're on the far

406
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:35,680
left is a post showing the images that

407
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,989
tumblr said wouldn't be blocked using

408
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,329
its filter this is tumblr zone example

409
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,550
of the kind of thing that isn't going to

410
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,950
be blocked by its nudity filter this has

411
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:47,740
been blocked by there nudity filter so

412
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,450
speaking of filters last month the

413
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,270
European Union took the most drastic

414
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:54,190
step to censor and centralize the

415
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,980
Internet in the history of the free

416
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:59,230
world the European Parliament passed a

417
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:02,380
new copyright directive and included in

418
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:04,570
that was a very controversial component

419
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,640
of it called article 13 this was so

420
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,290
controversial that it attracted 5

421
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,420
million signatures on a petition

422
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,370
opposing it it was the largest petition

423
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,349
in European history in the second

424
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:18,340
largest in world history after the

425
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:22,060
petition against SOPA the earlier US

426
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:25,090
copyright directive now article 13 is a

427
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:28,119
rule that obliterates the safe harbor

428
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:30,280
for copyright it makes platforms liable

429
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,300
if their users post things that infringe

430
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,810
copyright even if they don't know about

431
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:38,150
and like susta this rule applies in a

432
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,939
way that creates a duty for the

433
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,890
platforms to examine everything that

434
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,440
their users post to ensure that it

435
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:47,930
doesn't infringe copyright and of course

436
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,420
that is gonna mean filters YouTube alone

437
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:52,400
they get 400 hours of video every minute

438
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,430
there's no way for them to screen that

439
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,590
without using automated systems now this

440
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,780
didn't stop our article 13s boosters

441
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,780
from insisting that filters would not be

442
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,459
required by the rule they they said well

443
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,440
look the light legal language in the

444
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:07,820
rule it doesn't say to you as a filter

445
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,560
in fact it says if you can figure out

446
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,569
how to examine all of the stuff that

447
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,329
your users post without filters you

448
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,619
should avoid filters if at all possible

449
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:17,179
but there's no way that human beings are

450
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,639
gonna be able to examine every tweet

451
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:22,040
every Facebook update every tinder

452
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,320
profile photo every source code fragment

453
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,569
posted to Korra and and determine

454
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,399
whether or not it infringes copyright so

455
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:29,780
whether or not the directive said it was

456
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,210
going to need filters it was always

457
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,280
gonna need filters look if I say I

458
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,920
require as a matter of law that you

459
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,530
produce a large gray African land mammal

460
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,090
with tusks and a trunk and four legs but

461
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:44,210
if at all possible don't make it an

462
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:47,480
elephant I'm still gonna get an elephant

463
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:49,310
and indeed in the few weeks since the

464
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,890
directive passed and I'm not making this

465
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:54,080
up the directive passed by five votes

466
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:56,690
and afterwards it turned out that 10 of

467
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,870
the MEP s had fat-fingered the wrong

468
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,700
button and the week since the directive

469
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,469
passed the European Commissioner who is

470
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,730
the biggest proponent of this as well as

471
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,580
the governments of Germany and France

472
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,980
have said this will absolutely require

473
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:12,530
filters which means that everything we

474
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,360
post to a European service provider is

475
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,639
going to be compared to a database of

476
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,919
copyrighted works and blocked if it

477
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,750
seems like a match now I call that a

478
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,610
database of copyrighted works but it's

479
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,200
been it would be much more accurate to

480
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,449
call this a database of works that

481
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,790
someone somewhere said was copyrighted

482
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,320
because under the system anyone can

483
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,240
claim copyright to anything just by

484
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,530
uploading it to the database you could

485
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,420
put the whole works of Shakespeare in

486
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:37,760
you could put the alphabet in you could

487
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,560
put Happy Birthday in there or a video

488
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,990
of a cop hitting a protester or a

489
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,020
picture of a company's effluent pump

490
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,160
pipe dumping pollutants into the water

491
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,530
supply

492
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,780
and then no one else could be able to

493
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,520
post it once it's in the database it

494
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:56,129
will be blocked across all these service

495
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,200
providers and the directive and its

496
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,240
authors explicitly rejected any

497
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,820
penalties for falsely claiming copyright

498
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,000
over something that doesn't belong to

499
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:08,220
you even in cases of malicious attempts

500
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,110
to censor information or even in

501
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,870
attempts to steal an artist income by

502
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:15,389
falsely claiming their work as your own

503
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:18,530
but there's more because just after the

504
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:22,200
directive passed a white supremacist in

505
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:24,899
Christchurch murdered 50 people at two

506
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,720
mosques and live-streamed a grotesque

507
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,100
terrorist attack and in the aftermath of

508
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,190
that attack countries around the world

509
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,870
are eroding safe harbor even further

510
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,700
than the copyright directive does

511
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,790
they're adopting rules that require

512
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:42,559
platforms to remove offensive violent or

513
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:44,909
terroristic content in one hour or less

514
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,160
that rule has already passed in

515
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:49,290
Australia it is advanced in the European

516
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,990
Union and the UK Parliament just

517
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,940
accepted a paper from its regulator with

518
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,110
similar language and in case you're

519
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,240
thinking that this sounds reasonable

520
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,419
because after all nobody wants that

521
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,710
stuff to be live-streamed consider this

522
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,960
right after the rule advanced of the

523
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,330
European Parliament the French National

524
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,650
anti-terror police submitted a terrorism

525
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,809
takedown to the Internet Archive

526
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,210
proprietor to the Wayback Machine and

527
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:15,090
this terrorism takedown which they gave

528
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,440
the archived 24 hours to comply with and

529
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,909
which came through at 4:00 in the

530
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,820
morning on the west coast where there

531
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:23,429
are located listed the entire Project

532
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:26,129
Gutenberg archive 15 million text files

533
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:29,340
and the collected works of the Grateful

534
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:31,380
Dead and they said somewhere and there

535
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,750
is some terrorist stuff you can figure

536
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,730
out what it is and remove it or you can

537
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,410
just remove all of it we're not going to

538
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,200
tell you what we had in mind

539
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:42,360
now this order under the Terrorism

540
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,860
regulation would have the force of law

541
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,780
even though it doesn't require judicial

542
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:51,419
review even though it is facially absurd

543
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:53,399
so the European terrorism directive

544
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,080
anti-terror directive it doesn't mandate

545
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,090
filters those were removed at the last

546
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,320
minute but there's no way that you can

547
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,139
respond to a takedown for 15 million

548
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,149
in one hour without filters any more

549
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,560
than you could identify remove all the

550
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,570
copyright infringement or human

551
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,360
trafficking or any other kind of bad

552
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:12,310
content at scale almost overnight in

553
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,350
less than a year we have gone from an

554
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:16,300
Internet where speech carries the

555
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,340
presumption of innocence where you could

556
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,620
post anything and it would be live until

557
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,629
it attracted a credible complaint to an

558
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,479
Internet where increasingly all of our

559
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:27,610
speech of every kind is being judged by

560
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,010
a set of unaccountable blackbox AI

561
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,780
algorithms an automatically censored if

562
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:34,300
it seems to fall into nebulous

563
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:37,030
impossible to pin down categories like

564
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:39,220
extremism or nudity or copyright

565
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,030
infringement and this happened on our

566
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,090
watch

567
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:45,160
this happened while we were all around

568
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:47,580
watching it happen in large part it

569
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:51,280
happened because we hate the platforms

570
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:53,620
nobody likes living in a 21st century

571
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,810
where our internet has been replaced

572
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,750
with these five giant surveillance

573
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:00,460
riddled websites where that where people

574
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:05,410
only post screenshots from the other

575
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:07,780
four but ironically are well-founded

576
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:11,110
desire to punish these giant platforms

577
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:15,430
only gives them more power think of

578
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:17,469
filters Google spent a hundred million

579
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,870
dollars developing the copyright filter

580
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,940
for YouTube Content ID and during the

581
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,250
European copyright debate YouTube CEO

582
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,620
went out and said actually we kind of

583
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,110
like filters because while Google would

584
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,850
prefer to have no regulation they can

585
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:33,250
live with regulation that only Google

586
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,379
can afford to comply with and that none

587
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:38,410
of its competitors can possibly hope to

588
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,420
comply with there aren't any European

589
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:42,460
startups with a hundred million dollars

590
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,280
kicking around to build a Content ID

591
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,620
when the rule kicks in and so at the

592
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,020
stroke of a pen the European Union has

593
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,330
wiped out its entire tech sector signed

594
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,600
its death warrant leaving the field open

595
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,939
for the handful of mostly us-based giant

596
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,330
tech companies who can't afford filters

597
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,980
and the British port blockade it's gonna

598
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,929
be administered by a Canadian company

599
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,280
called mine geek you've probably never

600
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,900
heard of mine geek but I'm sure you've

601
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,379
heard of the sites that they own porn

602
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,740
tube pornhub red tube youporn browsers

603
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,380
Digital Playground men calm

604
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,330
reality Kings and Sean Cody a company

605
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,400
that grew through the underhanded tactic

606
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:21,559
of destroying the revenues of for pay

607
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,660
rivals with clips uploaded to their free

608
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:26,480
sites and then buying those rivals at

609
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:28,309
fire sale prices will now be in charge

610
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,040
of the destiny of every competitor that

611
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:32,720
it hasn't yet destroyed is it any wonder

612
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,149
that Mark Zuckerberg went to Congress

613
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,460
two weeks ago and called for government

614
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:38,750
to regulate his company because with

615
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,030
Facebook at the table when those

616
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,530
regulations are negotiated all the

617
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,840
regulations will be guaranteed to be

618
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:46,550
ones that Facebook can live with but

619
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,199
they will certainly be onerous enough to

620
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:51,169
destroy any competitor that might

621
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,360
someday grow to challenge Facebook how

622
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,140
do we get here how is it that the tech

623
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,580
sector is so incredibly concentrated

624
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:01,040
well for one thing it's not just the

625
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,530
tech sector every industry has

626
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,240
experienced radical concentration there

627
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,070
are only four movie studios left it was

628
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,200
five until three weeks ago when Disney

629
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,120
and Fox consummated their acquisition

630
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,250
there are four record labels left

631
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,750
there's still five publishers for now

632
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,580
but it's going to be four if the rumors

633
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,290
about Simon & Schuster being sold to

634
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,389
HarperCollins turned out to be true and

635
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:23,570
not just books and publishing your

636
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:26,450
glasses one company an Italian company

637
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:29,450
called box ohtsuka they manufacture

638
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:32,809
Armani Brooks Brothers Burberry Chanel

639
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:34,760
coach DKNY Dolce & Gabbana Michael Kors

640
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:37,340
Oakley Oliver Peoples

641
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:40,850
Piersol Polo Ralph Lauren Ray Ban

642
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:41,178
Tiffany Valentino Vogue and Versace they

643
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,040
own

644
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:45,350
retailers like Pearl Vision Sears

645
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:48,409
Optical sunglass hot and target optical

646
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:51,500
as well as LensCrafters and insurers

647
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:53,420
like IMed vision care and SL cell or the

648
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,300
largest lab manufacturing prescription

649
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:57,980
lenses and contact lenses in the world

650
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,600
right so every time you buy glasses you

651
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,100
buy them from one company it's not just

652
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,459
glasses it's not just entertainment it's

653
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:07,939
not just tech it's wrestling there's one

654
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:10,370
wrestling league left the WWE worth 3.5

655
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,210
billion dollars and of course being the

656
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,889
only game in town

657
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:16,040
it can clasp its wrestlers as

658
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:18,320
contractors and deny them health care so

659
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:21,320
they're dropping like flies dying in

660
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,659
their 40s and 50s when you ask tech

661
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,050
sector investors how tech got so big

662
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,640
they have lots of answers

663
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,919
they'll tell you that it's because our

664
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,630
first mover advantage or because of

665
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,700
network effects but none of that

666
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,740
explains how wrestling got so

667
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,330
concentrated and besides if network

668
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,440
effects and first mover advantages are

669
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:41,010
so important then why aren't we

670
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,050
searching Alta Vista with our craze to

671
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:45,180
understand how everything got so

672
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:49,020
concentrated we need to go back in time

673
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:50,250
to a very special year 1979 that's the

674
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,980
year the first commercially successful

675
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,180
personal computer came to market it's

676
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,760
the year that this guy launched his

677
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:59,250
presidential campaign so Ronald Reagan

678
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,440
came to power amidst a wave of

679
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:03,840
deregulatory sentiment Margaret Thatcher

680
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,030
in the UK Brian Mulroney here in Canada

681
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,730
Helmut Kohl in Germany Augusto Pinochet

682
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:11,460
in Chile and they took power at a moment

683
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:13,170
in which the relatively even wealth

684
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,790
distribution that we'd had after World

685
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,290
War two when all of the wealth in the

686
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,570
world had been destroyed had

687
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:20,370
concentrated into a small enough number

688
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:23,010
of hands that they could start paying

689
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:26,179
for political influence to make policies

690
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:29,640
that made the rich even richer and

691
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:32,070
Reagan was a great fan of policies that

692
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,530
made rich people richer in particular he

693
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,960
subscribed to a bizarre a historical

694
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:39,060
theory of antitrust law Reagan thought

695
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,070
that antitrust laws purpose was not to

696
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:44,520
prevent monopolies but to prevent

697
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:47,310
consumer harm by which he meant prices

698
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,840
going up and his theory of antitrust

699
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,429
which is now the dominant theory of

700
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,439
antitrust around the world was that

701
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:54,720
monopolies were fine so long as they

702
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:58,740
didn't raise prices for consumers they

703
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,200
could do everything else but not that in

704
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,240
living memory companies were not allowed

705
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,220
to be vertically integrated right if you

706
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,320
ran a railroad company you couldn't also

707
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,450
own the companies that ship the freight

708
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,100
you could either own the thing in the

709
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,050
rail car you could own the rail car but

710
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,000
not both and companies weren't allowed

711
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,460
to grow by merging with their biggest

712
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,280
rivals or snapping up and crushing their

713
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,870
nascent competitors today we're asked to

714
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,030
believe that something has changed in

715
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,489
our technology that makes monopolies

716
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:28,470
inevitable but every single one of these

717
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,300
monopolist grew by doing things that we

718
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:33,120
used to prevent in the name of

719
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:35,460
preventing monopolies look at a company

720
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,428
like Google apart from search and Gmail

721
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,350
every notable product Google makes its

722
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:42,090
company that it made by buying a company

723
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:44,519
that would that it would have been

724
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:47,449
barred from buying before Ronald Reagan

725
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:50,610
came to power or thinking about Facebook

726
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,769
Facebook tells our tires that it spies

727
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:54,600
on us so much so that it can that it can

728
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:57,480
tell exactly what we're going to do and

729
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,129
that it can use machine learning to to

730
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,619
convince us if anything an advertiser

731
00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:02,820
wants us to believe Facebook claims that

732
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:04,889
it can use machine learning and

733
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,080
surveillance to build a mind control ray

734
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:09,899
but what Facebook really has is not a

735
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:14,580
mind control ray it's really detailed

736
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:16,739
dossiers non-consent rly compiled on 2.3

737
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,529
billion users and it can use those

738
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,700
profiles to target those users if you're

739
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:22,950
trying to locate someone who has a

740
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,139
really hard to find trait like someone

741
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,490
thinking of buying a refrigerator

742
00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:28,168
Facebook can offer you ads targeted to

743
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:30,299
recent home buyers or people who've

744
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:32,039
priced out kitchen renovations or people

745
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:33,240
who search for fridge reviews and it

746
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,759
could cross-reference them with their

747
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,289
net worth and their creditworthiness now

748
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,330
that's creepy and gross but it's not

749
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:40,980
mind control it's just a high

750
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,499
surveillance version of selling ice

751
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,299
water on a hot day or giving out coupons

752
00:28:43,499 --> 00:28:48,029
for free diapers to people leaving a

753
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:49,590
maternity ward now it benefits Facebook

754
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:51,480
to claim that they've got a face on mind

755
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:53,369
control ray you know you got companies

756
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,590
like Cambridge analytic Oh make millions

757
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:57,389
off that idea they tell us that they can

758
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:59,158
find reasonable people and turn them

759
00:28:57,389 --> 00:29:01,320
into Trump voters or get them to vote

760
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,629
for briggsie but it isn't it more likely

761
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,369
that they found racists and xenophobes

762
00:29:03,629 --> 00:29:08,428
and convince them that Trump and Briggs

763
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:10,529
it we're good ideas we know that every

764
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:12,690
public claimed that Facebook makes is a

765
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:14,340
self-serving lie don't take my word for

766
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,710
it that's what the Attorney General of

767
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,639
New Zealand just said about them so if

768
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,710
we're gonna just believe everything

769
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:22,469
facebook says why would we believe their

770
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:25,169
sales literature users don't like

771
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:28,470
Facebook but they can't escape it 15

772
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:30,179
million American users aged 13 to 35 lot

773
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,970
Facebook last year but most of them

774
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:34,950
landed on Instagram which is a Facebook

775
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,419
subsidiary that Facebook never would

776
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,090
have been allowed to buy if we were

777
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:41,190
still enforcing antitrust law indeed the

778
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:42,840
whole Instagram story is an important

779
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,509
lesson in the role that monopolies paid

780
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:48,779
plays in creating surveillance and other

781
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:50,220
inequities few of us remember that for

782
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,299
the first 10 years of Facebook's

783
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,369
existence they

784
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:56,360
build themselves as a pro privacy

785
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:58,559
alternative to rivals like Orkut and

786
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,689
myspace in fact they said the reason

787
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,549
that they had a walled garden was to

788
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:05,129
stop these surveillance happy rivals

789
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:06,840
from harvesting your profile and using

790
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:09,988
it to target from you and it promised

791
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,699
that it would never target you but each

792
00:30:09,989 --> 00:30:13,529
time one of those competitors went under

793
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,629
that promise got a little weaker and

794
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:19,139
Facebook surveillance and targeting got

795
00:30:15,629 --> 00:30:20,879
a little more aggressive and and as it

796
00:30:19,139 --> 00:30:23,008
grew in monopoly power and became the

797
00:30:20,879 --> 00:30:24,928
only game in town every web publisher on

798
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:26,519
the web added a like button because

799
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:28,739
without it they wouldn't get traffic and

800
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:30,029
now Facebook could spy on every web page

801
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:31,409
on the Internet

802
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:33,600
because every one of those like buttons

803
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:36,539
was beaconing user data back to Facebook

804
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,158
Facebook's dominance was near total but

805
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:39,899
the market was lucrative enough that

806
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,090
some people kept trying to break into it

807
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:44,729
and there's only one that really made a

808
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:46,738
go of it it's called snapchat and what

809
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,809
snapchats value proposition

810
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:51,509
we're like Facebook but we're private we

811
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:55,320
delete your conversations and it worked

812
00:30:51,509 --> 00:30:57,450
people flocked to snapchat because they

813
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,309
wanted privacy and the market wasn't

814
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,989
delivering it so what if Facebook - well

815
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:02,940
they'd acquired another company called

816
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:05,340
au niveau that made spyware designed as

817
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,440
a battery monitor an au niveau was used

818
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,689
to spy on Facebook users who are also

819
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,830
using snapchat it gave them the market

820
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,259
intelligence they needed to buy

821
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:15,600
Instagram and also to tune instagrams

822
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:16,980
features after the acquisition based on

823
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,480
the surveillance data they gathered

824
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:23,489
using or novel from snapchat users so um

825
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,989
everything about this story would have

826
00:31:23,489 --> 00:31:26,549
been illegal under a traditional

827
00:31:24,989 --> 00:31:28,019
antitrust law they wouldn't have been

828
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:29,580
allowed to buy Instagram they wouldn't

829
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,749
have been allowed to renege on their

830
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,658
promises they wouldn't have been allowed

831
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:35,429
to corner the market on and force

832
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:36,960
advertisers to add like buttons they

833
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:39,359
wouldn't have been able to use a nava to

834
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,909
spy on their customers and so today

835
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:44,369
despite a market hungry for privacy we

836
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:46,889
have no privacy oriented social networks

837
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:48,359
Facebook owns all the users who might

838
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:48,988
join those networks and they won't let

839
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:50,428
them out

840
00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:51,929
you know when Facebook started the

841
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:54,090
majority of potential Facebook users

842
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:56,100
were on MySpace and that Facebook's

843
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:58,139
biggest problem with luring users from

844
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,730
Facebook into MySpace was that everyone

845
00:31:58,139 --> 00:32:01,830
he wanted to talk to was still on

846
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:04,080
MySpace and so Facebook made a mace

847
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,720
myspace robot you gave it your login

848
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,699
credentials

849
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,289
it would log into myspace pull down the

850
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,270
message is waiting for you and bring

851
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:11,620
them into your facebook inbox and you

852
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:14,080
could reply to them there and it would

853
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,939
send them back to myspace and say sent

854
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,770
from Facebook why are you still using

855
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:23,289
MySpace but within a few years when a

856
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:26,289
competitor did this to Facebook Facebook

857
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:29,320
was able to muster a crack legal team

858
00:32:26,289 --> 00:32:30,640
that advanced a radical theory of the

859
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,139
u.s. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

860
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,659
another law that dates back to Ronald

861
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,220
Reagan passed in haste after Reagan saw

862
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:38,200
the movie wargames and was terrified

863
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:41,860
that America needed tougher anti hacking

864
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,929
statutes and they used it to destroy the

865
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,799
competitor power ventures that did that

866
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:47,799
and today

867
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,120
snapchat is limping along because most

868
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,220
of the people who want to use snapchat

869
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,799
can't because the people they want to

870
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:56,740
use it with are over there on Facebook

871
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:57,760
so to recap we're on facebook because

872
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,890
our friends are there

873
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,629
Facebook's dominance lets them coerce

874
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:03,370
web publishers into installing

875
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:05,770
surveillance beacons on most of the web

876
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:07,570
pages Facebook is valuable only because

877
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:09,908
they have dossiers that they can use to

878
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:12,100
target us for ads Facebook's only

879
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:13,960
competitor is a pro privacy alternative

880
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,969
which Facebook is crushing with

881
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,490
antitrust tactics that although

882
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:20,980
radioactively illegal have not been

883
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,659
enforced against for a generation even

884
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,309
though people are leaving Facebook and

885
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:26,200
droves they're ending up on other

886
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:27,370
Facebook properties because Facebook is

887
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,770
the only game in town

888
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:32,080
now apologists say that this is because

889
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:34,330
tech is different but I don't know about

890
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,649
you but it sure sounds to me like it

891
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:38,408
might be worth giving the old auntie

892
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:39,669
monopoly stuff a try at this point for

893
00:33:38,409 --> 00:33:40,929
one thing if there wasn't one big

894
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:42,880
Facebook than the decision that

895
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:44,950
Facebook's engineers make wouldn't be so

896
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,419
consequential it wouldn't be the one

897
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:48,490
place where streaming your white

898
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:50,770
nationalist terror attack could reach a

899
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:53,080
potential audience of 2.3 billion people

900
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:54,429
but of course some people say that

901
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,710
Facebook isn't just a place where people

902
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:58,450
go to stream those atrocities they say

903
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:00,610
that they're where the people who commit

904
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:03,010
those atrocities are recruited how we

905
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,939
manufacture those terrorists and there

906
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:06,340
is some truth to that

907
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,679
between the engagement algorithms that

908
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:10,779
increase pageviews and add revenues by

909
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:13,300
showing users controversial material and

910
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,220
the ability to target users who are

911
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,230
receptive to conspiracy theories and

912
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:19,089
racially motivated hate speech the

913
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:21,100
platforms have made it easier than ever

914
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:24,550
to recruit people to the cause of

915
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:26,618
genocide but if facebook is a people

916
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,990
finding system and not a mind control

917
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:30,940
ray it's worse as it's worth asking why

918
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:32,949
there are so many people out there who

919
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,020
are receptive to messages about the

920
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:37,719
desirability of genocide and other

921
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:40,719
conspiracies from anti backs to the Flat

922
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:43,480
Earth and for that I think we also have

923
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,699
to look to the time of Reagan we have

924
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,310
had 40 years of make the rich richer

925
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:51,310
policies and now the richest among us

926
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:54,279
are much richer and everyone else is

927
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:57,190
much poorer and the result is that our

928
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,680
institutions no longer operate as honest

929
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:02,350
brokers on the basis of evidence rather

930
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,419
they increasingly operate to enrich the

931
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:07,118
highest bidder whether that's the link

932
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,369
between cancer and tobacco or emissions

933
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,530
and climate control are opioids and

934
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:14,410
addiction or the copyright directive and

935
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:17,109
filter time and again it has not been

936
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:20,170
paranoid or conspiratorial to say that

937
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:22,960
the people who work for us in government

938
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:24,670
to collect evidence and sort the true

939
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,950
from the false have rather than doing

940
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:29,380
that been terminally compromised by

941
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:31,480
inequality and so you get a kind of

942
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:34,600
breakdown I call it the epistemological

943
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:37,450
crisis we no longer not only disagree on

944
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:40,089
what's true we disagree on how we know

945
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:42,759
what's true I mean think of the

946
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:44,560
anti-vaccine movement it's not crazy to

947
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,930
say that the pharma industry is

948
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,299
concentrated corrupt and gets away with

949
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:50,770
murdering its customers just look at

950
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:53,740
Purdue Pharma the company that

951
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:57,100
introduced oxycontin Purdue Pharma used

952
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:59,379
a bogus medical study a letter to JAMA

953
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:02,100
by a doctor that wrote up 12 case

954
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:04,810
studies as the evidence to push through

955
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,700
widespread prescribing practices that

956
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:08,140
ended up in the opioid epidemic that has

957
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,460
now killed more Americans than were

958
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,470
killed in Vietnam

959
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,240
so it's not foolish to say that the

960
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:15,669
pharma companies are willing to pursue

961
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,259
profit at the cost of human thriving and

962
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,760
it's also not foolish to say that the

963
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,260
regulator's get them let them get away

964
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,119
with it because they let them get away

965
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,010
with it after all when your industry

966
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:26,590
only has four or five companies anyone

967
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:28,090
qualified to regulate that industry

968
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:29,710
probably works for one of those

969
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,940
companies probably work for three of

970
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,500
them

971
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,930
companies and it's probably married to

972
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,060
someone who worked for the other two so

973
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,020
it is inarguable to say that pharma

974
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,460
companies are corrupt and that

975
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,250
regulators that let them get away with

976
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,260
it so it's not an unreasonable thing to

977
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,089
then conclude from that that vaccines

978
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:48,240
are bad for you now I think that's

979
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:50,549
totally wrong but you know if you were

980
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,750
an opioid denier ten years ago you could

981
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,920
have made the same arguments you could

982
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,510
have said oh well the doctors the

983
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,250
medical establishment are saying we

984
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,990
should prescribe tons of opioids as a

985
00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:00,569
matter of humane treatment of people

986
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:01,979
suffering and pain but I think that the

987
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:03,390
industry is corrupt and the regulators

988
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,950
are asleep at the switch so I say I'm

989
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:07,049
wrong I'd say they're wrong and you

990
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:09,240
would have been right so the same

991
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:12,900
principles that are causing our

992
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,310
neighbors to arrive at conclusions that

993
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:18,420
are putting us all at risk those

994
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:20,099
principles are not wrong people look to

995
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,730
conspiracies to explain their world

996
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:26,339
because our world turns out to be the

997
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:29,369
result of conspiracies right S&C

998
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:31,200
Laughlin gets the highest officials in

999
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:34,109
the Canadian government to try to give

1000
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,328
it a pass on corrupt practices exon

1001
00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:40,109
covers up its own knowledge of climate

1002
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:41,849
change and pays for expensive

1003
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:44,220
disinformation campaigns to muddy the

1004
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:45,930
waters the NSA wiretap the whole world's

1005
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,060
internet with the complicity of the big

1006
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:50,399
tech companies and they lie like crazy

1007
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:52,799
about it now these conspiracies don't

1008
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,240
come cheap the authorities who help the

1009
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,040
conspirators they expect handsome

1010
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,959
rewards they're the kind of thing you

1011
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,150
can only pull off in a new Gilded Age

1012
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,520
where policies have already been put in

1013
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:04,980
place to make the rich much much richer

1014
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:08,700
we won't make conspiracies implausible

1015
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:10,109
until we get rid of conspiracies and we

1016
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,290
can't do that until we tackle wealth

1017
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:14,940
inequality if we punish the platforms

1018
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:17,190
for their monopolistic abuses by

1019
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,960
imposing new duties on them that only

1020
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:21,599
the very largest companies can afford

1021
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,520
duties to monitor and filter their users

1022
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,220
we just make them the permanent

1023
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,720
overlords of the internet we once

1024
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,149
dreamed of an internet that would be

1025
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,490
democratic where we'd all get a say in

1026
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:34,589
its future but if we invest the

1027
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:36,240
platforms with state like roles and

1028
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:38,609
exchange for letting them grow so big

1029
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,348
that we can never depose them we are

1030
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:42,509
ending the dream of democracy and

1031
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:43,320
replacing it with a constitutional

1032
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,630
monarchy

1033
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,790
we're the Kings rule forever by divine

1034
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:49,920
right but a parliament of aristocrats

1035
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:52,200
put some limits on their actions and

1036
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,270
this is why it's so dangerous to say

1037
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,460
things like even if you're not paying

1038
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:57,960
for the product you're the product after

1039
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,420
all if you buy a one thousand dollar

1040
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,920
iPhone Apple will use all of these

1041
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,270
policies to make sure that you only get

1042
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,280
your phone fixed by Apple at whatever

1043
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,810
price Apple wants to charge and that

1044
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,070
they can end-of-life your phone when

1045
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,080
they decide that it's time for you to

1046
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:11,580
buy a new one and then they'll also make

1047
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,470
sure that you can only buy your apps

1048
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,390
through their store making sure that

1049
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:18,209
they get 30% of every time you spend

1050
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:19,770
your every app right they are selling

1051
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:22,200
you to their vendors they're selling you

1052
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:23,940
to their service providers even if you

1053
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,620
pay for the product you're still the

1054
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,650
product and that's how it works in

1055
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,950
monopoly Google makes money by spying on

1056
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,600
you

1057
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:33,089
Apple makes money by locking you in

1058
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:35,120
Facebook makes money by spying on you

1059
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:37,620
and locking you in

1060
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,180
adding price tags to today's free

1061
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:41,100
services will not make them more

1062
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,870
democratic or accountable it'll just

1063
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:45,120
make them more profitable indeed

1064
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:47,279
conditioning access to culture and

1065
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:50,430
discourse by the ability to pay in a

1066
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,190
society riven by inequality is just a

1067
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:56,040
way to guarantee that dollars allow you

1068
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:57,990
to speak louder than everybody else the

1069
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,970
only way to make big tech accountable is

1070
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:01,859
to make it smaller break up the

1071
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:03,419
monopolies ban the practice of using

1072
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:06,060
mergers and acquisitions for growth

1073
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:08,760
crackdown on vertical integration it has

1074
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:11,430
been a hell of a year for our planet and

1075
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,650
the internet and our species and we've

1076
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:16,589
got major challenges ahead of us climate

1077
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:19,440
change sexually motivated violence white

1078
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:20,880
nationalism I don't fight with for the

1079
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,130
internet because it's more important in

1080
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,890
these things the Internet is not what I

1081
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:28,770
fight for but it is but we're gonna

1082
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:30,359
fight with it's the terrain on which

1083
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:33,150
every one of those battles will be

1084
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,490
fought and won or lost and if we lose

1085
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:38,430
the Internet we lose the fight before we

1086
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:41,819
start we once dreamed of a democratic

1087
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:43,710
technology we once taught kids stem not

1088
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,110
so they'd be prepared for the job market

1089
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:47,310
but as technological self-defense so

1090
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:50,460
that they could program rather than

1091
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:52,770
being programmed a democratic anti

1092
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:55,240
oligarchic technological future is still

1093
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:57,730
possible if we seize the means of

1094
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,470
mutation and use it to organize to

1095
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:02,350
demand a future where we are neither

1096
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:04,569
spied upon nor locked in a future where

1097
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:15,420
technology sets us free rather than

1098
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:15,420
putting us in Chains thank you thank you

1099
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:23,720
so we have 10 minutes for questions is

1100
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,310
that right yes I like to call

1101
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,020
alternately on people identify as women

1102
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:29,210
or non-binary and people who identify as

1103
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,950
male or non-binary especially in a male

1104
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:33,770
heavy crowd like this it tends to be

1105
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:35,779
kind of a sausage fest during the QA but

1106
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:37,850
also I should point out at this point

1107
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,590
that when you announce this it's often

1108
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:41,390
the case that speaking as a guy the guys

1109
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:43,010
have been spending half the talk trying

1110
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,990
to think of a cool question that makes

1111
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:46,460
them sound smart whereas the women have

1112
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,810
been actually listening and so when you

1113
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,540
announce this sometimes you have to vamp

1114
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:52,040
as I'm doing right now while someone who

1115
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,630
identifies as a woman or non-binary in

1116
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,240
the audience thinks of a question but

1117
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:57,890
maybe by now someone who identifies as a

1118
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,319
woman or non-binary in the audience can

1119
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:02,960
ask a question can we maybe bring the

1120
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:07,400
house lights up so I can see people is

1121
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:12,770
that possible or can you see all right

1122
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:15,809
okay I know that was all pretty

1123
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:20,400
controversial so I can see why there

1124
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:30,780
wouldn't be any questions yeah in the

1125
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:32,549
back thank you hi Cory oh hey there was

1126
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,440
a woman in the back favorite but go

1127
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:38,430
ahead no no go ahead when I won't get

1128
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:40,470
the mic to her about Edward Snowden so

1129
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,839
you had kind of a picture of him earlier

1130
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:46,410
and I was wondering if you think what

1131
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:49,640
Edward Snowden did was wrong and what

1132
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:52,470
your take on that would be yeah I mean

1133
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:54,450
my take is that what he did was right I

1134
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:56,220
think that he took an oath to uphold the

1135
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:57,930
Constitution I think he went through

1136
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:04,459
every whistleblower mechanism available

1137
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:07,109
to him and was brushed off or threatened

1138
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:11,849
and I think that he did us all a service

1139
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:14,910
I think that the our governments did not

1140
00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:16,260
create secret forms of law because they

1141
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:18,390
thought that we'd be pleasantly

1142
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,640
surprised and didn't want to spoil it I

1143
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,900
think they did it because they knew that

1144
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,180
it was wrong and that it was

1145
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:27,029
unconstitutional and that it would not

1146
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:29,520
reflect the will of the people I think

1147
00:43:27,029 --> 00:43:31,079
that most of that I think the whole

1148
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,020
surveillance program actually could have

1149
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:35,250
been statutorily approved if they

1150
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,180
thought that there was political will

1151
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,339
for it

1152
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,109
without compromising the ability of the

1153
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:42,089
system to work and they failed to do so

1154
00:43:40,109 --> 00:43:44,029
the fact that the Australians have now

1155
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:47,250
enacted some of that and the fact that

1156
00:43:44,029 --> 00:43:49,260
in the run-up to the 2015 election here

1157
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,480
Justin Trudeau with the Liberals to vote

1158
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,210
for c-51 which enacts much of that as

1159
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,349
well I think is disturbing but it at

1160
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:57,390
least tells you that we had the

1161
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:59,010
conversation on I'll note for the record

1162
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:00,960
that Trudeau said that he was only

1163
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:03,390
whipping the Liberals to vote for it

1164
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,039
because he said that they didn't want to

1165
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,839
be seen as soft and terror running up to

1166
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:08,579
the election and that they would fix it

1167
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,440
after they got elected he failed to do

1168
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:13,760
that in the same way that Obama when he

1169
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,920
was a senator voted and

1170
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,450
for supported the idea of immunizing the

1171
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,310
phone companies for their complicity and

1172
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:20,990
mass surveillance and promised that he

1173
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:24,049
would fix it once he got into office and

1174
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:38,209
again never did there was a woman in the

1175
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:40,700
back there thank you thank you really

1176
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:43,900
good talk actually follow EFS quite a

1177
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:46,299
bit so I hear what you're saying it

1178
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:50,660
really needs to be said a lot more but

1179
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:52,640
my question is how do not get

1180
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:55,279
overwhelmed by this would be like what

1181
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:59,240
can you do while still maintaining your

1182
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,680
job I mean that's that's you want to get

1183
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,319
involved in these things but at the same

1184
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:05,379
time you're still somebody has to you

1185
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,150
know provide for your family you have to

1186
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:10,100
you know you don't want to be the person

1187
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:14,870
that's particularly in a surveillance

1188
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:19,880
world it's black this person is a little

1189
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:21,710
bit too out there yeah that's an

1190
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,450
excellent question and I would add to it

1191
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:25,160
with with as a friendly amendment how do

1192
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:26,120
you not lose hope because that's a thing

1193
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,379
that I think a lot of us have been

1194
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,940
struggling with this last year has been

1195
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:31,250
really hard I have to say that I think

1196
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:34,310
that we lost 10 years ground in the last

1197
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:36,320
12 months and that we will be we will be

1198
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:39,230
spending the next 10 years undoing the

1199
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:42,230
damage for example that 10 mbps made by

1200
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:45,410
literally pressing the wrong button I

1201
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:47,960
mean it's yeah I mean if I've been I

1202
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,430
mean to call it like face palming is a

1203
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,160
cute thing you do I've been doing the

1204
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:57,440
non cute version of face palming for a

1205
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:59,450
month now I can't believe it so I think

1206
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,920
that we are inclined the reason these

1207
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:02,299
problems are overwhelming same with

1208
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,520
climate change saying with all these

1209
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,780
other big systemic problems is that for

1210
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,700
40 years we've been framing them as

1211
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,620
individual problems right when you think

1212
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,060
about climate change what's the most

1213
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,380
common message about climate change if

1214
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,210
you go and look at like an article

1215
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,520
that'll be in the Sunday weekend

1216
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:17,470
magazine you know the week

1217
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,270
globe about climate change will be like

1218
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:21,669
ten things you can do around the office

1219
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:23,650
to help climate change I'm here to tell

1220
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:25,120
you that unless your office is the

1221
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:27,130
office of the minister the environment

1222
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,620
there are zero things you can do around

1223
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:31,540
the office to prevent climate change in

1224
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,200
any meaningful way like you could be the

1225
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:37,240
world's most diligent recycler and

1226
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:39,700
unless we can muster a collective will

1227
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:42,310
to do something about climate change it

1228
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:44,439
won't matter right that our climate

1229
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:46,029
change problems are collective ones you

1230
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,370
know systematic under investment in

1231
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:50,380
public transit is why we have individual

1232
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:52,180
vehicles on our roads and that's

1233
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:55,330
probably your biggest contribution to

1234
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:57,160
climate change right there and you you

1235
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:59,890
giving up your car won't make a subway

1236
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:02,230
up here right we need we need collective

1237
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:05,620
solutions to this so Lawrence Lessig

1238
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:08,890
who's a great thinker about a technology

1239
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:10,540
and about political change he talks

1240
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:13,089
about the world being regulated by four

1241
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:15,460
forces he says that we're regulated by

1242
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:18,270
code which is what's technologically

1243
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:20,920
possible law what's legally allowed

1244
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:23,620
markets what's profitable and norms

1245
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,180
what's socially acceptable right I mean

1246
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:28,509
I think that there were a lot of us in

1247
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:30,370
the late 90s and early 2000s who thought

1248
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:33,160
of doing what Facebook does right is

1249
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:35,770
spying on everyone and and mining it for

1250
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,000
for actionable market intelligence but

1251
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:40,840
we all thought that would be creepy

1252
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,070
right normatively we didn't do it not

1253
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,210
because it was technologically

1254
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:46,000
impossible but because it was

1255
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:48,340
normatively undesirable and so norms

1256
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,300
affect what we do technology affects

1257
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,590
what we do things that are

1258
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,390
technologically impossible

1259
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:54,370
you don't need laws against them right

1260
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:55,569
no one does them anyway and once

1261
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,580
something is technologically possible

1262
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:59,260
laws may not be very effective against

1263
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:00,549
them I mean one of the things that I

1264
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,380
think the Australians are gonna find

1265
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:04,780
themselves contending with it's that

1266
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:07,360
unless you block github people are gonna

1267
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,950
download working cryptography but it'll

1268
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,530
just be the bad guys and the paranoid

1269
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:12,939
people and not everyday people which

1270
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:14,620
means that they'll all be at risk of

1271
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:17,440
having malicious firmware updates for

1272
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:19,750
their pacemakers and bad guys will be

1273
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,250
safe so code changes what's possible

1274
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:23,110
markets change what's possible once

1275
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:23,860
something is a business model people do

1276
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,970
more of it

1277
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:26,720
right the reason that we're getting

1278
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:29,060
anti-circumvention code and

1279
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,919
our engines and tractors is not because

1280
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:32,420
manufacturers just like the sound of it

1281
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:35,359
it's because they make more money when

1282
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:38,119
they do it and what's legally allowed

1283
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:42,020
changes what we do I mean this morning I

1284
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:44,330
landed at Pierre Trudeau Airport in

1285
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:46,250
Montreal and as I went through

1286
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:47,960
immigration I was delighted to see the

1287
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:50,630
sign that said all cannabis products

1288
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,970
must be declared right what's legal

1289
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:56,690
changes what people do to right people

1290
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:58,490
now in use marijuana that's both the

1291
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:00,349
recreational medical substance in a way

1292
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:02,149
that a lot of people didn't before was

1293
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:03,710
legalized I mean there were people who

1294
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:05,030
oppose legalization because they said

1295
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:06,530
once it's legalized more people will do

1296
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:08,990
it they were right I mean now that it's

1297
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:10,820
legal more people do it right so law

1298
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:13,098
code norms and markets they all interact

1299
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:15,770
with each other and you can think of

1300
00:49:13,099 --> 00:49:17,510
these it's as axes of freedom or axes of

1301
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:19,700
motion that you can traverse a

1302
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:21,320
complicated terrain under right in

1303
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,700
computer science when we come up against

1304
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:25,340
a terrain that's too complex to

1305
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:27,589
enumerate rather than trying to

1306
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:29,420
enumerate it which may take so long that

1307
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:31,490
by the time we're done we don't run at a

1308
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:33,680
time to solve the problem or the terrain

1309
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:35,779
will have changed we use heuristics we

1310
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,368
use hill climbing to traverse these

1311
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:39,619
complex terrains right we pick a

1312
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:43,310
gradient that we want to ascend right we

1313
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:45,140
want to go towards some goal and then we

1314
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:47,089
ask ourselves from all the directions

1315
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:49,129
that our code can move in for all the

1316
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:50,960
degrees of freedom that we have which

1317
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:53,839
one takes us further up that gradient

1318
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:57,349
and when we attain a news resting spot

1319
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:59,210
we can from there look at what motion

1320
00:49:57,349 --> 00:50:00,410
what area of freedom are available to us

1321
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:02,330
you know there's no climbing it

1322
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:04,160
analogizes to an insect the forward

1323
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:05,869
facing eyes they can't see where the

1324
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,029
high ground is the only way it can climb

1325
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:10,369
is by asking itself which leg is on the

1326
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:12,109
highest terrain and it takes one step in

1327
00:50:10,369 --> 00:50:13,580
that direction and now it pulls its legs

1328
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,348
and it takes one step in that direction

1329
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:18,470
well the directions that our legs rest

1330
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:20,210
on our code law norms and markets when

1331
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:23,509
you find yourself confronted with a

1332
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:25,880
legal regime that you that is hopeless

1333
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:28,099
ask yourself if there's a normative step

1334
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,589
that you can take to invalidate the

1335
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:32,240
legal regime think about you know the

1336
00:50:30,589 --> 00:50:35,180
fights that we've had over things like

1337
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,979
gay marriage which were mostly normative

1338
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:39,348
fights right there was some legal fights

1339
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,960
at the end but mostly it was a

1340
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:41,670
combination

1341
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,920
of people having the privacy and

1342
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:45,530
self-determination to decide when they

1343
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,180
could tell the people that they loved

1344
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:52,110
that they were gay and recruit them as

1345
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:55,500
allies and and also big normative events

1346
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:58,080
like gay pride parades and you know

1347
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:00,240
those normative things they added up to

1348
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,350
a legal change and so when you come up

1349
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,609
against the limit of what you can do

1350
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:04,259
legally maybe there's a normative thing

1351
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:06,300
you can do or because of this audience

1352
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:08,820
maybe it's a technical thing right maybe

1353
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,620
you can contribute to Sir pot to

1354
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:12,990
increase the level of encryption on the

1355
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:14,970
Internet sir pod cff free and open

1356
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:16,919
source tool for using the free

1357
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:22,140
certificates from simply secure form um

1358
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:23,940
not simply sorry I'm let's encrypt thank

1359
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:27,779
you I always hated that name from let's

1360
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:30,120
encrypt and and so maybe you can maybe

1361
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:32,100
you can you know get one of the pull

1362
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:34,920
requests there and and and and you know

1363
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:37,650
squash a bug we have all these different

1364
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,780
areas of motion available to us but the

1365
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:41,880
most important thing is that you have to

1366
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:44,430
see these as collective endeavors right

1367
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,590
like you and I and no one we know we're

1368
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:49,500
never going to fix this individually but

1369
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:50,820
together we do right I helped write a

1370
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,530
treaty called the access to information

1371
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,360
treaty that then became the Treaty of

1372
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:56,850
Marrakesh which safeguards the rights of

1373
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:59,250
people who are blind and have other

1374
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:01,589
disabilities to access copyrighted works

1375
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:03,330
in assistive formats and when we convene

1376
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:05,160
the first access to information treaty

1377
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:07,890
meeting it was at the meselson frontier'

1378
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,450
offices in Geneva and the guy who can

1379
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:10,650
mean it was a guy named Jamie Love who

1380
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:13,020
runs a nonprofit called knowledge

1381
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:14,700
ecology International and someone in the

1382
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:16,050
middle of this exercise was like 7:00

1383
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,609
a.m. on a Sunday we're all sitting

1384
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:19,770
around talking about this stuff they

1385
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:22,260
said to Jamie like what makes you think

1386
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:25,140
we can do this this is ridiculous and he

1387
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:26,970
said the World Trade Organization trips

1388
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,920
agreement the thing that that makes the

1389
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:31,950
copyright agreement in the WTO that

1390
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,900
makes this even necessary was written by

1391
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:35,160
people no smarter than you in a room

1392
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,260
less than a mile from where we're

1393
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,120
sitting right if they can do it we can

1394
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,860
do it right it is our collective

1395
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:43,259
endeavor that makes the change there was

1396
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:45,540
no one heroic champion who made that

1397
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:47,220
happen and there will be no one heroic

1398
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:49,050
champion that fixes it it will be our

1399
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:50,730
collective effort that makes the

1400
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:52,470
difference and if we have a tenure

1401
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:53,370
challenge ahead of us to figure out how

1402
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:56,040
we're gonna resolve

1403
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:57,000
this last year then that's the tenure

1404
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,920
challenge we're gonna have to take

1405
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,350
because abandoning the internet is not

1406
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,850
an option right if we abandon the

1407
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,870
internet the people who want to use it

1408
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:05,339
to do horrible things

1409
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:07,859
well and say well I guess we should

1410
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:09,660
abandon it to write the Internet just

1411
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,920
loses its defenders and becomes worse

1412
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,690
and worse and worse

1413
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,600
so we don't have a choice we have to

1414
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:17,800
fight for it thank you I think that's

1415
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:21,419
time thank you very much

1416
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,419
[Applause]
