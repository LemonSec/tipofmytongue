1
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:24,360
[Laughter]

2
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:44,360
it all boils trying to most of the time

3
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,699
not all the time but most of the time

4
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,590
we're trying to protect data and most of

5
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,920
us are probably familiar with the three

6
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:55,159
facets of data security that we call it

7
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,690
CIA confidentiality integrity and

8
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,760
availability this is pretty

9
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,820
straightforward this is nothing new but

10
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:04,310
it boils down to can you keep your data

11
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,770
safe can you protect it from being

12
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,690
altered and can you make sure that the

13
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:12,080
data is always available when it needs

14
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,730
to be available there's a few nuances to

15
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,600
that that have been added in our

16
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:18,299
technology world in our Internet

17
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,280
connected world but you can still argue

18
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:26,879
that if more or less falls down to those

19
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:32,160
three categories I may remember that

20
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:36,630
movie and it is what's the name of the

21
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:39,660
movie sneakers thank there's a scene in

22
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:43,070
the movie where the good guy and the bad

23
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:45,720
guy Robert Redford and Ben Kingsley

24
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:49,230
they're having a conversation and Ben

25
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,640
Kingsley is making a statement and I

26
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,650
want to read it to you because I think

27
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,200
it still holds true today in fact I

28
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:57,390
think it's always gonna hold true and he

29
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,570
says there's a war out there old friend

30
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:03,330
a world war and it's not about who's got

31
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:07,408
the most bullets it's about who controls

32
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:10,710
the information what we see in here how

33
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:15,480
we work what we think it's all about the

34
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:17,100
information now for me to have an

35
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,409
old-timer moment does anybody know what

36
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:22,469
they're sitting on right now in this in

37
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:26,429
this shot hey Craig I knew you would

38
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:28,110
know anybody else no it's a Cray

39
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:30,059
computer it's a mock-up of the Cray

40
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,129
computer if you want to see a real Cray

41
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:33,840
computer you can go to Maryland and go

42
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:37,110
to the Fort Meade National Cryptologic

43
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,120
Museum they have a Cray computer in the

44
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,280
museum that's one of the computers that

45
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,408
I literally used to work on when I was a

46
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,450
cryptologist I don't know say so stuff

47
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:47,789
that I used to do is now in a museum and

48
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,620
the last time I shared that her to talk

49
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:52,590
somebody shouted out when are you going

50
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,570
to the museum be in the museum but as

51
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:56,129
this is totally just a free

52
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,720
advertisement for the National

53
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,010
Cryptologic Museum I know it's a haul

54
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,169
for you guys from up here in the

55
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:02,879
Maritimes but definitely worth your

56
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:04,409
while if you do happen to ever MIT find

57
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,000
your way down to Maryland and want to go

58
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:07,500
to the museum get in touch with me if

59
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,260
I'm around I'd be happy to give you a

60
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,740
tour and show you lots of lots of really

61
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:15,658
cool stuff there anyway that's a sidebar

62
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:18,150
my point is and what I keep coming back

63
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:20,130
to is I don't think technology is ever

64
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,110
gonna solve our problems I think in fact

65
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:24,660
the technology is our problem

66
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:27,330
somewhere along the line in our

67
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,310
in our rush to throw information in data

68
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:32,429
on the internet and making extreme

69
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:35,220
streaming and freely available and all

70
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:37,620
the data at our fingertips at any time

71
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:41,580
at any place in any way in any form I

72
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:43,500
think we collectively have already

73
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,210
agreed to give up on the security of

74
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,160
that data just by the mere fact that

75
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,660
we're putting it out there just the

76
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,170
thought I had a couple weeks ago a

77
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:54,000
grittier disagree but one of my early

78
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:56,460
lessons that I was taught by a chief

79
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,320
scientist at NSA and this goes back to

80
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,870
when I was trying to design a software

81
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,689
system to be used as an encryption

82
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:06,899
system was whatever can be created by

83
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:08,580
man can be broken by man and you know

84
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,550
virtually all the cryptography that's

85
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,870
out there in our computer world today

86
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:15,540
even though it's billions and billions

87
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:18,840
of bytes and bits and you know super

88
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:20,610
long keys and and huge prime numbers and

89
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,550
so on and so forth and not even the

90
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:27,240
sidebar into quantum cryptography or

91
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:29,430
quantum computing but it's all solvable

92
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,500
it might take as new leaders to solve

93
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,750
brute force but there's a solution out

94
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,850
there and it's ultimately softball not

95
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,400
the one-time pad the one-time pad if you

96
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,990
use it right it can't be broken so as

97
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,210
far as I'm concerned we should still be

98
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:46,580
using one-time pads it's not pretty not

99
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:49,410
very practical though so this gets into

100
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:51,889
what I want to talk about in terms of

101
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:55,140
what I learned classically about

102
00:22:51,890 --> 00:23:01,170
security and and pose a couple questions

103
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:03,270
to you I learned back at NSA what what

104
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:06,330
we knew then and what we call now the

105
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:07,260
risk equation if you google risk

106
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,240
equation

107
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,340
there's hundreds if not thousands of

108
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,530
them out there a lot of product vendors

109
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,800
a lot of security consultants advisers

110
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:18,480
auditors very often will try to use or

111
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,030
talk about the risk equation so there's

112
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,400
lots of formulas out there there's lots

113
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:25,860
of formulas that go to great lengths to

114
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,920
try to actually come up with real

115
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,870
working numbers I've never been into

116
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,180
that as much I like to try to simplify

117
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:35,539
these concepts so that more people can

118
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,940
understand in my experience

119
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,840
over the years of working with customers

120
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,809
organizations that were having to do

121
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:44,779
security particularly in the PCI world

122
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:47,210
these were companies that security

123
00:23:44,779 --> 00:23:48,739
wasn't in there their DNA it wasn't

124
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,690
something that they had experience with

125
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:52,100
it wasn't part of their culture they

126
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,499
didn't have people that had long

127
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,059
backgrounds and insecurities they were

128
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:58,729
pretty much dragged kicking and

129
00:23:56,059 --> 00:24:00,559
screaming into it it's not exactly true

130
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:02,710
for every organization there's certainly

131
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,570
organizations out there that that are

132
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:07,580
more proactive about security but I

133
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:10,029
think the majority of organizations out

134
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,439
there don't really understand security

135
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:14,779
don't really want to have to do it so

136
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,789
they you know just tell us what to do to

137
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:18,950
get by tell us what to do to get the Box

138
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:20,720
checked don't make us think just tell

139
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,419
them tell us what kind of boxes we need

140
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,279
how many where do we put them and what

141
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:28,099
color lights should the lights blinking

142
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:31,039
and that's that's been my experience

143
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:33,289
over many years and but what I've tried

144
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,059
to do is simplify and try to help them

145
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:37,249
understand what's going on

146
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:40,668
so I start with a very simplified

147
00:24:37,249 --> 00:24:42,529
version of the basic risk equation now

148
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:44,269
I'm not a mathematician so I don't get

149
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:47,989
all the terminology right that I could

150
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:50,470
but risk at its most basic form is a

151
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:54,019
function of three different variables

152
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:56,149
vulnerabilities threats and what I was

153
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:58,159
taught is countermeasures but for the

154
00:24:56,149 --> 00:25:00,830
sake of our discussion let's let's think

155
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,109
security maybe is what countermeasures

156
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,999
is but we'll talk more about that but

157
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:07,629
notice that the risk equation doesn't

158
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:11,059
technically have security in it at all

159
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:13,129
and these are terms that we've we hear

160
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:14,418
all the time we use all the time we

161
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:16,099
throw them around all the time

162
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:19,369
especially at industry conferences

163
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:21,019
vendor display booths I was walking

164
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:23,299
around there earlier today trying to see

165
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:25,070
which of these words were popping up and

166
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:27,259
didn't see too many of them out out

167
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:30,559
there actually today but there's a new

168
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:34,039
set of buzzwords that are out there and

169
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,869
I think part of the problem is we claim

170
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:37,849
to be security professionals or claimed

171
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:39,859
to be the ones that know just how bad

172
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:42,499
things are I don't think we always do a

173
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:44,119
good job of explaining things in a way

174
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,170
that people that are the decision-makers

175
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:46,750
can

176
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:50,900
understand and make well-informed

177
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:53,300
decisions so the way I learned this

178
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:56,480
equation and the and the definitions of

179
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:59,330
the components are simply this a

180
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,670
vulnerability in its most basic form is

181
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,800
a weakness and you know there's longer

182
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:06,880
definitions but the way I think of

183
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:10,040
vulnerabilities are it's a weakness

184
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,290
anywhere systems people processes

185
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:16,370
technology products hardware software

186
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:18,560
it's a weakness the threats and this is

187
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:20,600
the one that's a little bit tricky the

188
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,409
way I learned threats our threats are

189
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,149
the bad guys

190
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,710
threats are the ones that are your enemy

191
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,000
they're the ones that are out to get you

192
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:29,990
they're the ones that you're fighting

193
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,690
against again military turns Cold War I

194
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:35,090
was at NSA during the Cold War we used

195
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:37,190
to have a threat office that would

196
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:39,199
inform us if we were gonna be doing any

197
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,750
kind of international travel we had to

198
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,730
call the threat office to find out what

199
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:46,220
the threats were in the particular

200
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:48,200
geographic region that we were gonna be

201
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,120
traveling and of course I had to do that

202
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,040
one time I was going to West Germany and

203
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,080
I called the threat office I forget what

204
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,690
year it was exactly and they said oh

205
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,980
yeah the threats very high there's been

206
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:03,050
rumors of some sort of terrorist

207
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:06,020
activity that's brewing something's

208
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:07,730
going to happen it was kind of like

209
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,420
great so what am I gonna do with this

210
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:11,390
information

211
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,130
well the explanation I got from my

212
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:15,290
management was well you know you just

213
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,760
it's good to know that so that you can

214
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:18,920
be more careful

215
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,920
I did not tell my wife that the threat

216
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,540
level was high until many years later

217
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,140
and I still think she hasn't forgiven me

218
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:29,149
for that you know I saw a process

219
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,890
weakness the threat was high what do I

220
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,900
do about it and not travel no I still

221
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:35,030
needed to travel anyway threats are bad

222
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,550
guys threats are people the way I taught

223
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:40,580
it and then countermeasures the the

224
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:42,740
mitigation it's what you do to counter

225
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:45,590
all the things that are out there in

226
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:50,240
terms of vulnerabilities and threats so

227
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:51,830
if you look back at it risk then I think

228
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,290
everybody understands this intuitively

229
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,750
but just to explain it the goal is to

230
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:59,210
reduce risk to make it lower

231
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:01,520
at its most basic level make it low

232
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,950
enough that you can live with it make it

233
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,500
low enough that as an organization

234
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:08,330
you're you're comfortable with it it's

235
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,760
it's rich there's and there's different

236
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,379
kinds of risk financial risk risk of

237
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,470
data loss you know you can sum it all up

238
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,750
in different ways but at its most basic

239
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,820
component it's lowering risk and to do

240
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:22,490
that and this is where I have a problem

241
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:25,280
with our industry you do it by lowering

242
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:27,260
vulnerabilities or lowering threats or

243
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,750
doing more in terms of countermeasures

244
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,400
and it seems like this whole industry or

245
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,500
a good portion of this industry is

246
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,630
focused on that vulnerability variable

247
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,730
as if that's the only one that can

248
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:39,970
really change it's that that's the only

249
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:46,789
one that we really have any control over

250
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:49,400
so by the way you can find this in

251
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:51,320
various versions out on the internet and

252
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:55,010
it's kind of changed names over the

253
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:57,110
years but I originally knew it as the

254
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:59,690
national information system security

255
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:01,820
glossary the InfoSec glossary this is

256
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:03,350
where I got my classic definitions from

257
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:06,649
and I wanted to share these with you

258
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:08,600
just so you know I'm not making it up so

259
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:11,210
the definition from the glossary which

260
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:15,020
was produced by NSA many many years ago

261
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:17,000
and has been adapted over time risk is

262
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,460
the possibility that a particular threat

263
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,710
will adversely adversely impact an

264
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:24,320
information system by exploiting a

265
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:25,039
particular vulnerability sounds pretty

266
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,200
straightforward

267
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,120
the threats a little bit different and

268
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,610
the threats a little bit more what I

269
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,709
hear in terms of threats today in terms

270
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:36,110
of our conversation and dialogue is in

271
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:38,179
industry which only bugs me because I

272
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:40,520
think of threats as people but threats

273
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:43,429
have become the things that happen the

274
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,690
things that are done to our systems the

275
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:47,240
things that are introduced to our

276
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:50,179
systems either on purpose or

277
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,549
accidentally so any circumstance or

278
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:54,919
event with the potential to adversely

279
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:58,908
impact impact an information system and

280
00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:02,510
so on and so forth this is actually a

281
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:04,730
slide from a deck that I used over 20

282
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:06,530
years ago when I was first out in the

283
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:08,370
private sector trying to teach what I

284
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:11,940
learned about security to my

285
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:13,590
it's my customers my prospects and we

286
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,990
listed the threats and you can see most

287
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:18,030
of them are really people they're their

288
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:21,059
actual beings there's a couple things in

289
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:22,980
there that are events so I think threats

290
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,840
I think what I've evolved to is threats

291
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,900
are either people or events and the

292
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:30,780
events are more often than not caused by

293
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:33,990
people or at least by the in actions or

294
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:35,760
the wrong actions of people and then we

295
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:37,980
also had to talk about and we learned

296
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,050
about at least classically why would the

297
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,610
bad guys the threats want to do the

298
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:45,540
things to you

299
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:47,070
my question for you is has I think this

300
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,830
slide kind of stands today

301
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:51,870
it hasn't changed a whole lot I don't

302
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:56,100
know if you agree or disagree but some

303
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:57,840
again something to think about the

304
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,730
definition of vulnerability out of the

305
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,459
wall street weaknesses and information

306
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:04,890
systems weaknesses and procedure its

307
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,420
weaknesses in internal controls and so

308
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,520
on and so forth it's not just the

309
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,470
systems the technology it's everything

310
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,410
around it and anything that could go

311
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:16,920
wrong might go wrong gets lumped in as a

312
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:18,480
vulnerability and again as somebody

313
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,840
that's been in the business a long time

314
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,390
and has learned to trust certain tools

315
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,459
and certain programs and things over

316
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:28,320
time I pulled out some of these and now

317
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,670
you know vulnerabilities aren't a

318
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,919
vulnerability today unless they have a

319
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:34,020
logo but some of these things are

320
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,030
affecting systems that have been around

321
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,590
for 20 years that we've discovered

322
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:40,290
vulnerabilities and things that we've

323
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:41,820
trusted for vulnerabilities so it got me

324
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:44,520
to the point where I kind of thought

325
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:46,169
maybe just maybe we shouldn't think of

326
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,900
vulnerabilities is something that we can

327
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:51,390
manipulate as much in that risk equation

328
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,820
but let's get through this and we'll

329
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:55,830
talk more about that countermeasures and

330
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:59,760
finally again these are the things that

331
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:01,980
you do to sort of negate the effect or

332
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,240
the impact of those other components of

333
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:08,490
the equation so and it can be anything

334
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,950
in our context it's very often

335
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:12,990
technology we think of security products

336
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:15,660
security solutions very often they're

337
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,940
monitoring solutions very often there

338
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:20,629
are things that are

339
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:22,190
to detect what we would call anomalies

340
00:32:20,629 --> 00:32:23,809
things that aren't supposed to be

341
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,429
happening or happening at different

342
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:27,619
times or anything that's out of the

343
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:32,389
ordinary that might indicate that

344
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:38,109
something's going on but my question

345
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:40,699
then is in that whole equation if risk

346
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:43,158
is some sort of a product of

347
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,889
vulnerabilities and threats and

348
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:48,999
countermeasures and if so much of our

349
00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:52,399
industry is focused on the vulnerability

350
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:54,979
component the thought I've had for a

351
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,168
while that I just submit to you for

352
00:32:54,979 --> 00:32:59,929
thinking about and maybe we can talk

353
00:32:57,169 --> 00:33:02,479
about is what if all the stuff that

354
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:05,299
we're doing to try to drive down the

355
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:07,489
vulnerability accounts in an

356
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:10,789
organization in our organization in our

357
00:33:07,489 --> 00:33:13,039
private lives if if you follow my logic

358
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:14,749
that in this equation there's three

359
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,908
different variables and maybe one's

360
00:33:14,749 --> 00:33:17,749
called security and one's called threats

361
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:19,940
and one called

362
00:33:17,749 --> 00:33:21,739
and one is called vulnerability if

363
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,200
there's already a variable in the

364
00:33:21,739 --> 00:33:26,899
equation that's called security and it's

365
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,919
not vulnerabilities then what is all the

366
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:30,649
stuff that we're doing about

367
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,289
vulnerabilities maybe that's not

368
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:34,418
security at all maybe that's just our

369
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:39,158
job

370
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:41,690
maybe our job is to produce secure

371
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:44,239
software and applications that don't

372
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:48,159
have vulnerabilities in them maybe it's

373
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:51,799
our job to to administer systems

374
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,149
applications servers devices that don't

375
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:55,849
have the vulnerabilities in them

376
00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:57,889
obviously its security related but maybe

377
00:33:55,849 --> 00:34:00,799
it's not fundamentally what security is

378
00:33:57,889 --> 00:34:02,809
so I asked the question if security is

379
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,849
another variable in this equation and

380
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:07,070
it's not all the stuff that we do about

381
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:09,319
vulnerabilities and it's not all the

382
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:13,418
stuff that we do with threats then what

383
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:13,418
is it it's an open-ended question

384
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:22,899
somebody laughs cliff so let's go back

385
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,819
to the risk equation and this one's a

386
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:27,549
little bit different and this one I've

387
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,720
adapted more or less for what I would

388
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:33,090
call the private sector the commercial

389
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:35,649
world when I learned risk in the DoD

390
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:38,350
basically what was at risk in one way

391
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:43,750
shape or form at the DoD level with the

392
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:45,819
military level was human life so there

393
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:48,820
was sort of this concept of there was

394
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:50,620
money with object I worked at NSA at a

395
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:53,260
time where there was huge budgets and we

396
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:55,630
got to buy everything we had we had one

397
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,460
of everything at least I think we had a

398
00:34:55,630 --> 00:35:01,420
couple Cray computers and they were not

399
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:04,440
cheap we had source code to UNIX

400
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:06,940
operating systems before Linux ever

401
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,680
existed so we had the opportunity to

402
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:11,680
purchase and have source codes so we

403
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,450
could get into the internals of how you

404
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,520
early versions of the UNIX operating

405
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:20,350
system work and so on and so forth so in

406
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,060
the military terms that all had to do

407
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,710
with human life you know whether we're

408
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,330
protecting our military on the

409
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:28,030
battlefield whether we're protecting our

410
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:30,009
citizens at home or abroad our state

411
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:32,290
department our ambassadors whatever it

412
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:34,270
is that all loosely related and revolved

413
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:37,509
around the protection of human life

414
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:39,640
American life u.s. life but human life

415
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:43,990
in the commercial context so it's

416
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:46,029
different in the commercial context most

417
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:48,459
companies aren't out there you know

418
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:51,010
worrying about the life of their

419
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:53,560
employees or management it really has to

420
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:56,760
do with the profitability of the company

421
00:35:53,560 --> 00:36:00,220
the organization it has to do with money

422
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:02,530
so new to this equation is trying to

423
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:04,450
assign some value to the data that

424
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:08,710
you're ultimately trying to protect in

425
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:10,089
this risk based model but it really

426
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:13,240
boils down to

427
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:15,340
there's the as far as the risk is again

428
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,589
I'm simplifying but risk in a commercial

429
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:21,070
sense is the ability for an organization

430
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:23,350
to earn revenue on the one hand and the

431
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:26,020
other risk is how much it's gonna cost

432
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:28,270
them to conduct business and that cost

433
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,259
then gets spread out over all the

434
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,960
equation

435
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:33,550
it's why this industry exists because

436
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,930
there's so much money out there that's

437
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:37,359
spent and there's so much money out

438
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:39,790
there to be made because every step of

439
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,009
the process whether you call it security

440
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:44,050
or not every element that goes into this

441
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:47,140
whole thing that we're loosely calling

442
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:49,810
risk there's a dollar cost to it so the

443
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,720
equation at the end of the day has to do

444
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:56,590
with how much are you willing to spend

445
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:59,560
and where to get to some sort of level

446
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:02,140
of where you think you're safe in terms

447
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,390
of risk and then of course if something

448
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:07,990
bad still happens are you prepared from

449
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:09,400
the cost of associated with that it's a

450
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:11,799
little bit different way of thinking

451
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,570
about security I think and it's it's

452
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,490
again it's not new but it's out there

453
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:19,390
and probably most of this intuitive ly

454
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:21,490
understand this but it's certainly a

455
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:23,049
little bit different from the dynamic of

456
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,939
protecting human life you know

457
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:27,790
protecting the American Way protecting

458
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:30,010
our citizens it's protecting our

459
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:33,460
profitability it's protecting our bottom

460
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:35,590
line it's it's it's it's how much or how

461
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,270
little we're gonna spend of our of our

462
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:41,320
profits in order to keep this business

463
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:42,940
going and that it's not bad in and of

464
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,190
itself it's just a different way of

465
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:47,080
thinking of things and I think it puts

466
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:50,619
things in a different perspective and I

467
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:52,420
think it's why we so often get don't

468
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:54,190
explain security to me and just tell me

469
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,109
how much I have to spend because they

470
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:58,780
you know people understand intuitively

471
00:37:56,109 --> 00:38:01,240
at some level it's a it's a money it's a

472
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,310
dollars game they don't necessarily

473
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:06,040
understand that there's more to it than

474
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:10,000
that and I guess what I'm suggesting is

475
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:13,180
that maybe rather than coming up with

476
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,040
something continuously new and shiny and

477
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:17,500
different that we can spend more money

478
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,050
on in hopes of solving this overall

479
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:24,340
problem maybe we need to think more

480
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:26,500
about doing more to teach and explain

481
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,810
exactly what it is you're trying to

482
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,270
accomplish in your organization whether

483
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:33,310
it's where you work or it's the customer

484
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,910
that you're working on behalf of to

485
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:37,009
explain

486
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:39,230
what's the big picture what's really a

487
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:41,240
play here explain that it's about data

488
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:44,120
help companies understand what it is

489
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,529
that they have that's worth protecting

490
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:49,220
that needs protecting

491
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:50,540
try to figure out some value to it the

492
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,520
money is gonna need to be spent

493
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:55,730
somewhere along the way I guess my

494
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:58,040
contention is I think where my customers

495
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:59,660
have felt like I have helped them over

496
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,790
the years it's when I've helped to make

497
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,410
a more informed decision about their

498
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:06,230
spending not that they weren't gonna

499
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:07,460
spend the money and in PCI especially in

500
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:11,110
the early days there was a lot of

501
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:15,010
companies spending a lot of money anyway

502
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:19,340
so I go back to this this main question

503
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:21,410
first of all agreeing on the terminology

504
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:23,240
or at least understanding that there's

505
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:25,580
differences to the terminology the

506
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,649
components of the risk equation I guess

507
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:29,750
my frustration very often has been I

508
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:31,790
hear people in conversations especially

509
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:34,070
at conversations especially at the

510
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:36,560
vendor booths not to pick on the vendors

511
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:38,840
but I hear people using these terms like

512
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,840
risk and vulnerability and threat almost

513
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:44,660
interchangeably like they're synonymous

514
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:46,550
not apparently understanding that there

515
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,440
are different components of this overall

516
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:52,130
equation and that there's differences

517
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:55,340
between them and again ultimately it

518
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:57,530
boils down to for me and it's it's a

519
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:02,600
question that I put to you guys to think

520
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:04,340
about is if the name of the game if what

521
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,220
we're really doing is more about risk

522
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:09,260
then you know where does security fit in

523
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:14,390
and what is security at the end of the

524
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:15,560
day I'll give a little bit of my opinion

525
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:17,060
but I really don't want to give too much

526
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,830
in my opinion because I think it's

527
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,750
something that we should all think about

528
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:24,380
and we should all ask ourselves well

529
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:26,810
what is it that we're talking about I

530
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:29,090
hear two things very commonly when I

531
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:32,480
hear people talking about security or if

532
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:35,710
I stop and ask them what is security

533
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:40,040
I think the predominant view is a

534
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:43,060
perception that secure security or being

535
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,670
secure as the state that you achieve you

536
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:49,180
you make your network your systems your

537
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:52,990
applications your databases impenetrable

538
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:55,830
impervious to attack the bad guys the

539
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:59,290
hackers the pen testers the red teamers

540
00:40:55,830 --> 00:41:01,810
the malware is nothing can penetrate

541
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:05,410
nothing can get to you and so that's

542
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:07,750
there's this state of being secure I

543
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:11,470
think that's the prevailing attitude

544
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:14,500
about it again my view it's a little bit

545
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:17,259
different what I see is being secured or

546
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,690
what security is has more to do with all

547
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,570
the things that you have to do after

548
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:25,030
you've done all the stuff to reduce your

549
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:28,330
vulnerabilities or to identify at least

550
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:30,460
point out what your threats are it's

551
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:31,600
things like knowing your network knowing

552
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:34,210
your systems knowing your environment

553
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,670
knowing the habits of your people if

554
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:38,290
it's ongoing this is one of the hardest

555
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:41,080
lessons that a lot of the customers from

556
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:43,270
PCI days have had to learn is PCI is not

557
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:45,400
a once-a-year go through all this

558
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:47,140
rigmarole to get to the finish line

559
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,290
where you're compliant and you have that

560
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:51,759
report produced in that standard there's

561
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:54,610
all sorts of things that you're supposed

562
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,760
to be doing on an hourly daily weekly

563
00:41:54,610 --> 00:42:00,400
monthly quarterly ongoing basis so

564
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,400
ultimately I think my view of what

565
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,950
security is is that it's a verb it's

566
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,990
something that you do it's not a noun

567
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:11,859
it's not an adjective it's not a state

568
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:15,189
that you achieve arguably it's both but

569
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:17,230
I think too often we're sort of locked

570
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:20,230
up on the we got to be secure we got to

571
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:22,360
secure all things the pragmatic part of

572
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:24,310
me says well no that's not practical

573
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,890
nobody is ever gonna drive the

574
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:29,259
vulnerability countdown to zero hasn't

575
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:30,580
happened yet and if you're honest with

576
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:33,160
yourselves I don't think it's gonna

577
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:36,069
happen so again I'm not a mathematician

578
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,500
but there's probably some term for when

579
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:41,020
a variable and equation is to be treated

580
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,670
more like a constant if you're

581
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:45,550
mathematician you can explain it to me

582
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:47,410
later what it is but you know if it's a

583
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:49,690
constant and threats are relatively

584
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:51,670
constant what's left to do it's that

585
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:53,010
thing that you do on an ongoing basis

586
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,470
that's security that has

587
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:57,720
more about knowing what's going on which

588
00:42:55,470 --> 00:43:01,169
means observation which means knowing

589
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:03,569
the processes the data flows doing all

590
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:05,700
sorts of things to monitor and react

591
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:10,320
that to me is what security is

592
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:11,939
ultimately you can agree with me or

593
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,590
disagree with me hopefully I'm just

594
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,780
making you think a little bit and maybe

595
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:17,400
think differently maybe not in a new way

596
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:21,750
but maybe in a way you haven't thought

597
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,340
of for a while our time is running up if

598
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:25,100
you're at all intrigued with what I've

599
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:28,590
been talking about you want to hear more

600
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:31,470
I am part of a podcast called Paul

601
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:33,150
security weekly I'm one of the hosts you

602
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:34,680
can tune in where we usually broadcast

603
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:36,690
every week in fact we're broadcasting

604
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,629
tomorrow but I'll be here so I won't be

605
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:41,400
on it and here's the escort I had at

606
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:43,680
Atlantic security conference three years

607
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,560
ago they had a bunch of storm troopers

608
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,379
dressed up here and they walked me to

609
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,970
the stage I'm also in a book called

610
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,340
tribe of hackers if you haven't heard

611
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:55,649
about it yet tribe of hackers calm it's

612
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:57,480
it's a charitable thing if you buy the

613
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:59,820
book that all the proceeds are going to

614
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,550
charity there's 70 people in it that are

615
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:05,640
have been recognized as people that are

616
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:07,800
innovators influencers some young some

617
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:10,799
old new different it's it's a pretty

618
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,890
good cross crosscut of different people

619
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,230
in our industry all answering the same

620
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:19,589
questions there's a set of 14 questions

621
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:21,420
and we all responded to so it's a good

622
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,920
book to get a hold of I'm still working

623
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,750
through reading at all several of the

624
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,520
people speakers here today or in the

625
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:31,460
book I'll leave it to you to figure out

626
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,460
who they are I don't know if cliff

627
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:37,590
there's a group of people that get

628
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,780
together with Jean Stafford once a year

629
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:41,580
at RSA conference and I was allowed to

630
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:45,930
be into that group a couple years ago

631
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:48,029
and they call themselves from an

632
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:50,190
educational perspective there's an

633
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:53,610
organization called hack for kids to put

634
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:55,650
out this educational card game it's an

635
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:58,050
interactive fantasy type trading card

636
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:59,670
game I don't play it do that stuff that

637
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,740
there's face cards called in hacker

638
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:04,590
anism so I'm part of that if you go to

639
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:08,490
Freaker dot life

640
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:10,590
get yourself a couple decks and the

641
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:12,270
front of the cards are all about the

642
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:14,760
history of hacking and freaking from the

643
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:17,580
70s up through the 90s so it's kind of a

644
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,230
good educational thing my contact

645
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,700
information again if you still are

646
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:26,030
interested in getting in touch with me

647
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:26,029
and finally are there any questions
