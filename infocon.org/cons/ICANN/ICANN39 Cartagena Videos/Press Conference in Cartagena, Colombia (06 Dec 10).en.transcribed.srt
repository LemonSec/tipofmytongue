1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the room questions from</font>

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:08,160
the room here<font color="#E5E5E5"> pizza in your speech this</font>

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,500
morning you said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were referring to</font>

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hitchhiker's guide and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful element of it on the front was</font>

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,759
don't panic you've got a lot of issues

7
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,359
this week which no other people would

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,859
panic over to my mind is a letter from

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,930
the US government which was asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,640
not to approve the applicant but

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,990
guidebook this meeting and and

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,150
suggesting that you would broken the

13
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,180
affirmation of commitments there's the

14
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,269
issue about<font color="#CCCCCC"> xxx which may or may not</font>

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,800
come up there's the accountability and

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,200
transparency review team which is

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,640
reviewed a key element of the of the

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,980
affirmation and they've come up with

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,110
various recommendations there's the

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,879
relationship that you share with the GAC

21
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,430
which is obviously crucial particularly

22
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,649
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ionic contract that I can</font>

23
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,969
relies on come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out next year and there</font>

24
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:58,800
was a letter from the Olympic Committee

25
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:01,609
threatening to sue I can if I can didn't

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,518
provide it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the special exemptions</font>

27
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:08,850
for dot olimpiada eggs etc in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld</font>

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,790
process so with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> listen my</font>

29
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,890
question broadly is how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those do</font>

30
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,680
you expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to resolve this</font>

31
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:22,259
meeting how much them<font color="#CCCCCC"> you expect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:24,030
resolve at all well thanks Karen the

33
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,130
diatonic message was was was really

34
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,310
light-hearted let's let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> be clear about</font>

35
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,009
that this is a fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> typical case load</font>

36
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,439
in fact for an icann meeting every time

37
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,540
we come together these<font color="#E5E5E5"> meetings is a</font>

38
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,979
great concentration of taking advantage

39
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,630
of the fact that the global community's

40
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,729
meeting to discuss intended issues and

41
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,439
so a great long list is usually put

42
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,560
together and this meeting is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,669
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> much different I don't know if you</font>

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,560
want to work through<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of those it may</font>

45
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,280
take a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we'll deal with all of</font>

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">those in our way we're considering how</font>

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,630
to respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the letter from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dept of</font>

48
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,950
commerce as rod said in his speech what

49
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,289
we are very pleased about is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

50
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a very clean open communication</font>

51
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,829
through the public comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> system and</font>

52
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,259
there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> times when perhaps</font>

53
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,090
communications from governments haven't

54
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,649
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite so so visible the entire</font>

55
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,940
community has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to see that and</font>

56
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,030
judge that and we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a lot of lot of</font>

57
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback as a result of</font>

58
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,340
it so that we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

59
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,660
xxx-yes that was a major contention for

60
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,810
a long time we<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

61
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,850
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> that without much without much</font>

62
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the sort of hysteria that seemed to</font>

63
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,120
surround some of the earlier

64
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,640
applications we would get letters from

65
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,550
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorts of people about that that</font>

66
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,220
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be been taken much more much</font>

67
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,620
more calmly these days you mentioned the

68
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,030
accountability and review team which we

69
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">of course a very pleased to have this is</font>

70
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,470
a there's a very important process from

71
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,450
accounts perspective last year we enter

72
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,040
the reporting relationship we had with

73
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">the US government and we've changed to a</font>

74
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,329
relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we report now and are</font>

75
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,459
accountable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire community and</font>

76
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that community coming in and</font>

77
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:58,360
auditing us in relation<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our</font>

78
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,239
accountability and transparency and

79
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,680
reporting back to the community on on

80
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,620
what its findings are and then making

81
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,300
recommendations to the board so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

82
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">what the board has seen of the of the</font>

report and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comment that's</font>

00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">come and whether encouraged a very</font>

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,910
diligent job has been done by the

86
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,250
community independently to order<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICANN's</font>

87
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,870
accountability and transparency and has

88
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,820
made what seemed at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage to be a</font>

89
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,340
set of implementable and useful

90
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,810
recommendations I i can't speak for how

91
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,880
the board will will respond but that

92
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:31,810
seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the general community</font>

93
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:35,549
reaction relations<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the GAC are good</font>

94
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:37,510
we've been working on a joint board GAC

95
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,090
working group to improve collaboration

96
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:43,048
and there are elements of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 RT</font>

97
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:47,200
report that will help us improve their

98
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:48,400
as I can absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> dependent on strong</font>

99
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,290
support from the governments of the

100
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,670
world the GAC is the place<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

101
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,858
<font color="#E5E5E5">come to to provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that support</font>

102
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,708
membership of the gap is growing we now

103
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:58,390
have all of the all of the g8

104
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,910
governments of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> g8 countries and</font>

105
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,010
members of the GAC and and and our

106
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,989
contributions from them very worthwhile

107
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,149
and perhaps rod might like to detail a

108
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:08,530
bit later on a very supportive<font color="#CCCCCC"> leader</font>

109
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,880
we've recently received for example from

110
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,680
the Chinese government and I know you've

111
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,420
been working with the with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Russian</font>

112
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,459
government on a number of fronts<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

113
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,010
relationships<font color="#CCCCCC"> with governments in</font>

114
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,149
general and the gang in particular

115
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,370
moving in a very positive sort of

116
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:23,500
trajectory yep the ionic contracts

117
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,390
coming up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> review we've got plans in</font>

118
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,770
place and we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> started preparation for</font>

119
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font>

120
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,400
so the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the last one you</font>

121
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,260
mentioned I think Kieran was the was was

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,120
it was a communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the Olympic</font>

123
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,620
Association I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> again what we need</font>

124
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,970
to do is sit with them at some stage and

125
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,190
just explain what a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and</font>

126
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,360
effort we've put into building

127
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:44,710
protection for trademark owners and the

128
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,910
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld program</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I once they understand</font>

129
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,739
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the protections that are</font>

130
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,840
available for brand holders in that

131
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,730
program we hope they will be as

132
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,830
satisfied as as most other brand holders

133
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,720
are with the with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP protection</font>

134
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,340
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when we started the price</font>

135
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,380
is one of the fundamental principles<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

136
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD program was not to infringe</font>

137
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,250
the rights of others and so we've worked

138
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,050
very hard and building that program to

139
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,260
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that those sorts of</font>

140
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,760
rights are so getting in first you

141
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,349
manage to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them quite a lot of</font>

142
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,150
question there Kieran but let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

143
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,290
there's anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> else has one gentlemen</font>

144
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,510
we've got a question from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Doogie</font>

145
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,190

with regard to predicting net benefits

performed two studies

and we've spent almost a million dollars

183
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,030
on those studies seeking to answer these

worth 35 billion dollars and there's

myspace and other ventures in that in

00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,830
that area let's appear innovation that I

221
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,560
don't think anyone could have properly

there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be no end of economic studies</font>

studies do provide some contribution to

00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,000
the discussion and clearly the analysis

to come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think that's something</font>

was<font color="#CCCCCC"> related so there's a sort of i'm</font>

trying to unravel exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> them what</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the leader we're considering our</font>

336
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,130
is sort of teasing out the different

00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,930
parts of the letter summer would seem to

we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> working through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a through</font>

daily as a board by very good efforts

from staff and it's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the board</font>

00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:22,150
getting better<font color="#E5E5E5"> did the letter from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

369
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:24,709
US government there were several clear

370
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:27,500
assertions in it which I wonder if

371
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:29,900
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would be willing to respond</font>

372
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,330
to one as they<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US currency the</font>

373
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,790
affair would be unrealistic for you to

374
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:37,070
approve the guidebook and the second was

375
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:41,150
it listed three issues that it felt were

376
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:42,560
unrealistic and it said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you had it</font>

377
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,720
felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you had breached the</font>

378
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,040
affirmation when it listed the three

379
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,950
hour you know what the three are one

380
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,860
going to them my question is do you feel

381
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:54,470
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be unrealistic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and do you feel</font>

382
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:57,890
that you have breached<font color="#E5E5E5"> the affirmation</font>

383
00:14:54,470 --> 00:15:00,560
of commitments first is I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

384
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:02,569
the word breach appears in the letter

385
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,390
but perhaps we can we can read<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

386
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:10,150
again and certainly I don't believe has

387
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:12,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">been interpreted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as such on our side and</font>

388
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,689
you know obviously there was some

389
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,370
strongly held opinions there and there's

390
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously different stakeholders that</font>

391
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,270
have very strongly held opinions about

392
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:25,550
this program both for and against and

393
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:28,010
and i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the ICANN board does</font>

394
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,920
its utmost to to balance the different

395
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,550
views on complex policy issues and come

396
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,069
to decisions

397
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:37,229
and we look forward to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that continued</font>

398
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,870
dialogue and we also look forward to the

399
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,930
finalization of the 80 RT review on our

400
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,070
accountability and transparency as we

401
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,949
all know the difference between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font>

402
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:48,990
government saying we feel that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

403
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">not following up the affirmation of</font>

404
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,579
commitments is that is the core document

405
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:56,010
for icon that is where you getting a lot

406
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:58,199
of your legitimacy from that is the only

407
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:01,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">agreement that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have which is with</font>

409
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:07,319

410
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,779
feel you have broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> it are you able to</font>

411
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,550
say well we don't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have or</font>

00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:15,000
you able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say we will look at whether</font>

we have again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't believe the word</font>

414
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,870
broken appears in the letter and I think

415
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:25,320
that it'sit's feedback that will

416
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:27,180
consider and will either respond to

417
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,649
directly or respond to more broadly as

418
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,620
part of the input provided on the new

our jobs of course as the as the is

427
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,750

got written confirmation from most of

the consumers if you like of that

431

00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:00,359
that's where we get our legitimacy from

00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:02,310
from from from the ccTLD burant managers

435
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,230
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD registries and registrar's</font>

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,260
and he look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that look at the ceremony</font>

438
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,579
this morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's all those people</font>

439
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,290
have voted to come to this meeting and

440
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,000
participate in this week of policy

441
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:14,309
debate that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what gives i can as</font>

442
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,679
legitimacy we can terminate either party

448
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,449
powerful document because what I in it

449
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:31,980
what I can does is declare to the world

450

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the United States go and we those</font>

commitments out of it to the to the

00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,980
that's where we that's the that's the

power of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the document but it's not a not</font>

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives us a legitimacy is the way we</font>

462
00:17:54,269 --> 00:18:00,350
made no secret that it would like to

463
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:02,519
advocate wide expansion of ipv6

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,360
allocate the IPV addresses to technology

minimis annual fees to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be members of</font>

00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:44,730
those organizations and we can get

479
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,408
quotes for what those would be here in

receive an allocation of ipv6 that cost

487
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,409
is very low I mean far below one penny

488
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,940
per address because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the blocks of</font>

and the annual fees to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> are areas are</font>

491
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,158
quite low the caught the primary

492
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:24,899
economic costs and I'm not an expert on

493
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:27,440
the network operations topics but to my

494
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:29,928
understanding has to do with network

495
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,850
reconfiguration and software work in a

496
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:34,740
different software and human related

497
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:37,259
costs and in some cases upgrading

498
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,379
equipment but there can be some costs

499
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:42,299
there it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really depends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the network</font>

500
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:44,730
most of the networking gear which has

501
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:46,799
been sold in the last number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of years is</font>

502
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,749
fully capable of supporting ipv6 so

503
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,100
anyway it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network depends</font>

504
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:51,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the circumstance and I think that we</font>

505
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">really a good question to direct to the</font>

506
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:57,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">ISP constituency here and I can or some</font>

507
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:59,520
other group that specializes in that

508
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,959
area one thing I can say

509
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,000
that we have heard is it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

510
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,900
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a new network it's cheaper</font>

511
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,730
to go implement ipv6 initially than it

512
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,370
is to go implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> ife v4 and then you</font>

513
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,090
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come back and change it to ipv6</font>

514
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,590
because then you make an initial

515
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,679
investment configuration and then you

516
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,270
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back and reconfigure again so</font>

517
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,980
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an old</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> song that</font>

518
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:22,139
I'm told is if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> building a</font>

519
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,660
significant new network start with ipv6

520
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,430
in the first place but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again that</font>

521
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,820
depends on the individual operators and

522
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:31,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">what they deem best and I just like it's</font>

523
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,210
for a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge as part of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

524
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,740
mean who knew when mobile phones were

525
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,300
broadened that texting was going to was

526
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be available and who knew that</font>

527
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">we would go with that with Twitter with</font>

528
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,580
every new technology as rod see there's

529
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,990
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly additional costs and</font>

531
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">different product so the challenge now</font>

532
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,940
is for those technical entrepreneur's to

533
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,530
find ways of using the additional

534
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,180
facilities that you get with an ipv6

535

out there waiting for entrepreneurs to

00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,399
come and develop Peter we have a

and later and it appears and the

question what's real for us is<font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get arrived there's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

issue in getting it done quickly and as

00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,080
we've proved<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think in the years that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have been spent and doing the policy</font>

554
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,290
development and then several<font color="#CCCCCC"> years of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that i mentioned and all that work</font>

that's gone into it we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it</font>

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">right and if we have to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,450
bit longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that's</font>

speaking on<font color="#E5E5E5"> behalf of the board then we</font>

562
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,300
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the appropriate amount of time</font>

00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,410
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get that right we are we understand</font>

564
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,110
and doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's an enormous</font>

00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:59,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">pent-up frustration and the commercial</font>

unleash its creativity its

entrepreneurial energy in this new area

569
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,770
and on the other hand is the legitimate

570
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:09,510
concerns of incumbents and others for

00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,070
whom any change is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be upsetting</font>

so it's a continuing balancing exercise

00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,630
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say dear Monica at the end</font>

the ITU and with Hamilton<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Ray can I</font>

599
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:18,540
ask what specific plans you have and

600
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:20,580
could you foresee an equivalent of an

601
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:23,940
affirmation of commitments with the ITU

602
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:27,449
in the near future or do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any</font>

605
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,840
stuff is their progress with that

relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope that we can post</font>

607
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,560
your question is public commentary on

608
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,240
our overall international strategy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

609
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:42,060
relations IV that that's a new idea it's

610
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,730
an interesting idea that that certainly

611
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:48,840
never occurred to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I think that what</font>

612
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:52,560
we were sharing is our appreciation for

613
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:56,550
having to raise actions in Guadalajara

614
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:59,970
and actually the the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT group</font>

615
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:02,730
that approved a resolution which I i

616
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:06,990
believe was the first in itu history

617
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:09,570
that recognizes i can by name and our

618
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:13,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">exists existence as an institution and</font>

619
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:16,980
as another player in the echo system so

620
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,900
we appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that step and we have many</font>

621
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,000
different touch points with the itu the

622
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,700
itu has a seat on our nominations

623
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,440
committee the<font color="#E5E5E5"> itu has a seat on our</font>

624
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,830
governmental advisory

625
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:32,940
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITU on a rotating basis also has</font>

626
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:35,460
a board liaison seat on our ICANN board

627
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:38,759
of directors and so I think we can to

628
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,799
wish<font color="#CCCCCC"> to continue to see continued open</font>

629
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:44,519
dialogue and progress in our

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:46,590
relationships and simply expressing my

631
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,299
personal as well as our institutional

632
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:51,000
gratitude to have it into ray and the

<font color="#E5E5E5">ITU thank you we have one online</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">gentleman quite honestly was the letter</font>

636
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,269
the answers now I was not a surprise we

637
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,679
get a variety of Correspondence about

638
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:09,750
all sorts of issues as Karen mentioned

639
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,950
we get letter threatening lawsuits if we

640
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,450
don't do something we get better

641
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,279
threatening lawsuits if we do do

642
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,870
something so we get a range of

643
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:19,200
passionate communications from a number

644
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:20,549
of players they say we we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently</font>

proliferation of DNS SEC seems to have

648
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:34,289
gone more slowly than anyone would like

00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:35,580
including I can why that's not doesn't

650

655
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:52,289
it's pretty excellent progress there is

656
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:56,669
is some real technical work that has to

657
00:25:52,289 --> 00:26:00,179
be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the registries to implement</font>

progress and as we mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

663
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:14,758
morning we've been informed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by verisign</font>

more than half the second-level domains

in the world which certainly means and

674
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:48,460
plus the 50 that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been signed there</font>

675
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:51,309
is plenty of opportunities<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

681
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:06,428
has the ICANN board chosen to deregulate

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,330
cross-ownership well for a number of

683
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:11,289
reasons that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are partly sit out in the</font>

684

resolution that we passed<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll meet</font>

when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> made that decision and more of</font>

00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:17,559
that will more of our boards thinking is

00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:22,379
going to be included<font color="#E5E5E5"> and other minutes</font>

688
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:25,899
etc from from that the the reasons a

689
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:28,029
largely that there is no observable or

690
00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:31,840
provable justification for creating

691
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:33,730
separation the reason we got to

692
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">separation is historic it related</font>

693
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:38,230
largely to the monopoly that existed in

694
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,029
relation to calm and really had very

695
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,970
little application<font color="#CCCCCC"> in relation to other</font>

697
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,389
the more we<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze that again took</font>

698
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,279
legal and commercial advice listen to

699
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:50,559
the community debate the eventual

700
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:53,860
conclusion was that this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a an</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">artificial constricting device that was</font>

00:28:00,369 --> 00:28:04,178
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think since that decision</font>

705
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:06,009
is there's been no criticism that i have

decision all of the focusing between on

710
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:15,279
the way the board made the decision

711
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:17,169
because we have had to step in after

712
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:20,470
with some reluctance because of the

713
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:22,210
inability of the community itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

714
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,220
that is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a too much vested</font>

722
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:40,749
time to do it then had to step in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do</font>

723
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,970
it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess we're reasonably pleased</font>

724
00:28:40,749 --> 00:28:44,110
that the decision itself seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

725
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:49,450
reasonably well accepted by the

726
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:51,399
community on XXX you<font color="#E5E5E5"> specifically</font>

727
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:54,609
resolve to us the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GAC</font>

728
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:57,399
to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to you because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you were you</font>

729
00:28:54,609 --> 00:29:00,668
wanted it to to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> greater clarity</font>

730
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:02,199
on whether on what its views<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on XXX</font>

731
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:03,429
and you specifically stated the

732
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,509
resolution that you wanted those to

733
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:10,989
conclude for this meeting is the

734
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:14,289
implication there for that if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GAC</font>

735
00:29:10,989 --> 00:29:16,599
says does not say we do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> want XXX</font>

736
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:20,109
that therefore you will have a vote<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

737
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:21,339
it is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the correct timer well we</font>

738
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:22,718
haven't actually asked them gag that

739
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:24,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">question and I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure the gag is</font>

740
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:26,589
going to come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a view saying we</font>

741
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:29,529
don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> xxx that the questions we've</font>

742
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:31,229
gone back to the GAC about relate to the

743
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:33,899
advice that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave in a number of</font>

744
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:36,549
publications and occasions in the past

745
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:38,439
some of them were questions some of them

746
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:40,089
came from individual members of the GAC

747
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,369
rather than the GAC itself so we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone</font>

748
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:44,259
back to just clarify what exactly is the

749
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:46,330
gap was what<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly did the GAC mean</font>

750
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:50,099
back in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wellington communique</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:53,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">2006 minutes in person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so forth so</font>

752
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:55,239
the reason what we what we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

753
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">and achieve by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Carter haina was to</font>

754
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:59,080
clarify that advice and then under the

00:29:57,009 --> 00:30:01,149
bylaws if we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are about to do</font>

00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,339
something orphan fact we do do something

00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:05,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">and don't follow gac advice we're</font>
