the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vice president of Vienna as Brad so</font>

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,460
nicely said that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet</font>

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,889
assigned numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> authority the internet</font>

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,160
number assigned numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> authority is one</font>

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:20,100
of the oldest internet institutions it

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,580
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> established in about nineteen</font>

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,220
seventy through a collaboration between

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">the US government and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> University of</font>

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">Southern California and jon postel was</font>

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,110
the individual who filled that role for

12
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,290
many many years and once the US

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,019
government moved away from developing

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,480
this research project which established

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:46,680
the IP addresses on which the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,919
is based today it transitioned out of

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,850
the role of running the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ayana and I can</font>

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,520
was established I can is now the I

19
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:59,670
nonprofit organization which houses the

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">iono and the iono functions and the IP</font>

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:06,000
addresses are one of the three functions

22
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,560
that are the role of the iono itself so

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,220
we are a long-running part of the

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,150
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the ipv4 and now the ipv6</font>

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,310
addresses are part of our portfolio so

26
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,409
I'll turn it over to Axl and he can then

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,350
say what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship between iono</font>

28
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,689
and the N are always very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> I shall</font>

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,658
do that so yes my name is axel public

like but the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> /</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most visible</font>

68
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,690
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> allocation of internet number</font>

69
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:24,169
resources that's ipv4 addresses ipv6

70
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:29,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">addresses and autonomous system numbers</font>

71
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:31,319
so that's us Elise bottom line in

72
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:34,319
inverted<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most simple of terms what</font>

73
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:38,910
is ipv6 and why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it important if you</font>

74
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:43,048
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP addresses like you</font>

75
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:45,180
know telephone numbers and ipv4 had a

76
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:47,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain number of addresses so that</font>

77
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,400
meant you could address a certain number

78
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:54,510
of devices and if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of telephone</font>

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,700
numbers as an analogy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that basically</font>

80
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you're saying is ipv4 is going to</font>

81
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,410
run out of numbers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't have any</font>

82
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:03,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">more phone numbers and that's what it's</font>

83
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,209
doing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> computers and the systems that</font>

84
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:09,930
connect them for the internet so ipv4 is

85
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:13,650
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have enough addresses for</font>

86
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:18,630
everyone who<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants one so basically ipv4</font>

87
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:22,710
has about 77 billion addresses and there

88
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,950
are three points and I'm sorry the world

89
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,810
has a population of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 billion people</font>

90
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:30,240
ipv4 has<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3.7</font>

91
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,620
I'm addresses so obviously that would

92
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,330
mean that not everyone in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

93
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,350
could have a phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number if it were a</font>

94
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:41,010
phone number<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an IP address ipv6 has</font>

95
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:43,770
enlarged that numbers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use</font>

96
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,510
for addressing devices so that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

97
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,880
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> having more telephone numbers</font>

98
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:53,280
available and they've enlarged it to

99
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:57,240
such an extent that you have 340 unda

100
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,969
silly ins I don't even know how to you

101
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,460
know it's described a nun d'sillin it's

102
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,470
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many zeros that it would take forever</font>

103
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,080
for us to run out of it or maybe not

104
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:11,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">forever but a very long time what is the</font>

105
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,690
current status of ipv6 roll out or

106
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,090
adoption whatever the appropriate phrase

107
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,700
is what is the current status and what's

108
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,940
the very immediate future I mean and<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

109
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:24,139
me pose that to both of you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

110
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:28,020
good enough if I may say that we have

111
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:32,280
talked about this the need of adoption

112
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:35,490
of ipv6 for<font color="#CCCCCC"> for more than 10 years as</font>

113
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,440
soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was becoming clear that we at</font>

114
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,450
some point would be running out of ipv4

115
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,660
addresses because the internet was such

116
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:44,460
a smashing success that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it grew so so</font>

117
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,820
quickly that at some point you would one

118
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:50,789
out obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new protocol was made</font>

119
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,729
that is very similar to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">something that needs to be deployed now</font>

123
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:02,880
urgently I'd say<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been saying</font>

of studies out surveys on eyes peas and

their ipv6 readiness as we might call it

done something who have rolled out ipv6

already however<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a relatively</font>

will hear from from at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least that we</font>

will be running out of ipv4 addresses

probably over the next year or so you

really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something if you are</font>

145
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:09,540
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue to hook up</font>

146
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,940
new customers and obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font>

147
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:16,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">grow your business if you are not an ISP</font>

148
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:18,660
but a an end customer end user somebody

149
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,659
running a web shop on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet you</font>

150
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,360
need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on ipv6 because at some point</font>

151
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:27,090
you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be losing parts of the internet</font>

152
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,830
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are not and that means eyeballs</font>

153
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,739
that means customers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end that</font>

154
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,659
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> income</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you so it is important</font>

155
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,140
to go and talk to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP and request</font>

156
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:42,480
ipv6 services if you are an ISP go and

157
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:44,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">roll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out ipv6 as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system and yes we</font>

158
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,500
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> given out ipv6 addresses for a</font>

159
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:50,180
long long time already and there are

160
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">lots of editors we are happy to continue</font>

161
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:59,070
so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to what axles</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just said</font>

162
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:03,359
ipv6 is not really a service that

163
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:07,590
customers see it should be much<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

164
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,170
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving from analogue telephones to</font>

165
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:13,020
digital telephones customers may have

166
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:15,720
needed a new kind of phone to connect to

167
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,430
their infrastructure but they didn't

168
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,850
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was because it's</font>

169
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:23,340
digital rather than analog they didn't

170
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:26,250
know and and you will have both running

171
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,619
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> long time together so from a</font>

customer perspective part of the

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,060
challenge of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition which has</font>

transparent to your invisible to your

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,860
customers that the customers don't

178
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:49,770
notice a change in their service so many

179
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:53,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">of us here at the conference today are</font>

180
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:57,079
running ipv6 as our infrastructure and I

181
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:59,900
our connections are over ipv6 you can't

182
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,480
tell it i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> still surf the web just</font>

183
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:05,329
like everybody else<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange email</font>

184
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,970
just like everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else the network</font>

185
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:10,760
works exactly the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technologists</font>

186
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:14,560
have done a very very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> job of making</font>

187
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:17,240
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the equipment is in the right</font>

188
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:21,739
protocols and that they can coexist with

189
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:25,550
ipv4 so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really inherent is for</font>

190
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:31,040
the service providers and the ISPs just

191
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:33,560
continue that either dual stack type of

192
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,680
approach where you offer both the v4 and

193
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:40,369
the v6 so that your customers though

194
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,739
have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's happening and yet</font>

195
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,529
you can expand your customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> base a base</font>

196
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:48,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can expand your reach ability and</font>

197
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:50,689
and have the opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> for introducing</font>

198
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,300
new services because there won't be the

199
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,650
limitation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a restriction on</font>

200
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,990
the number of addresses that are

201
00:09:54,650 --> 00:10:00,500
available to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you as a service provider</font>

202
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:02,900
or business here's a question from

203
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,390
somebody online what specifically are

204
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:09,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">you doing to encourage governments and</font>

205
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:11,240
the business sector to move to ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

206
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">as limited power that we have of our</font>

207
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,670
governments so far we hear questions

208
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,470
from the government's who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

209
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,449
concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about their national economies</font>

210
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:23,120
of course they they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully aware that</font>

211
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:25,339
quite a large amount of that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font>

212
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,680
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet is dependent on the</font>

213
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:30,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet and they hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that Oh something</font>

214
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,120
is going to happen there now it's

215
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,220
important to say at this point maybe

216
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,440
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet will continue to run</font>

217
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">even when we run out of ipv4 addresses</font>

218
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:43,160
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> ayana and at the rirs the deployed</font>

219
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:45,980
addresses keep deployed and the internet

220
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,870
will continue to run so<font color="#CCCCCC"> governments come</font>

221
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:52,420
to us<font color="#CCCCCC"> and said what what should we do as</font>

222
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:55,520
governments and we tell them there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

223
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:58,099
lot you can do in awareness building you

224
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,829
should talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you should request</font>

225
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:04,510
services and equipment that that you as

226
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:07,100
a government deploy to be ipv6 ready and

227
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,710
that's about all you can really do as a

228
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,370
government

229
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:14,070
you want to tread lightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

230
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:16,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">things i wanted to mention now that</font>

231
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:20,280
we're in columbia is that the Colombian

232
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:24,689
government has created a program called

233
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:27,079
vive de tal and there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> many parts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

234
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,790
this program which is to expand the

235
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:32,880
internet and the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> within</font>

236
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:36,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">Columbia to support its economy and the</font>

237
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:39,180
growth of the economy and a key part of

238
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,969
that program is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> deployment of ipv6</font>

239
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:45,420
in the promotion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ipv6 with in</font>

240
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:48,690
Colombia and so I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to applaud the</font>

241
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,579
Colombian government on this great

242
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,100
program that they've put in place and

243
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,080
their acknowledgement of the fact that

244
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,180
in order to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to grow their</font>

245
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,730
technological expertise and their

246
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:03,739
networking capabilities that ipv6 is a

247
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:06,210
component of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that program with God to</font>

248
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,520
businesses that is something which<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

249
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:12,480
doing right now we build awareness we

250
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:14,880
talk to people we ask the end users we

251
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,620
ask businesses to request ipv6 services

252
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,670
from the ISP so that there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

253
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,860
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> groundswell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of business</font>

254
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,089
interest because the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

255
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,430
might ask yourself why aren't more

256
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:29,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">people why aren't more operators</font>

257
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:33,390
deploying ipv6 the ground problems as

258
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:36,600
ELISA has said there is not much<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

259
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:40,199
the end customer really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sees in change</font>

260
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,320
there are no new features so many of the

261
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,120
ISPs say well this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

262
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,770
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us right now in future</font>

263
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,740
will become important than we do it but

264
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:52,230
right now we have other things to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

265
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,420
the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 deployment is always has</font>

266
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,180
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> always a bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will do it when</font>

267
00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:00,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have to so we are saying you will</font>

268
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:02,609
have to really sue now we're an online

269
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,410
question which countries specifically

270
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:09,000
are leading in ipv6 adoption oh gosh I

271
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:13,260
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to offend any country here</font>

272
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,350
but in the early stages at least of the

273
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,760
earliest deployments I would say and I

274
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,220
don't know Axl you may have a different

275
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,060
impression Japan was one of the earliest

276
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,440
countries to really invest

277
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:29,469
this and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that case it really was a</font>

278
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,780
government initiative that worked with

279
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:36,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the academic and research communities</font>

280
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:40,150
and then with their private companies to

281
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:43,270
build some ipv6 only networks within

282
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:45,430
Japan and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they were very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

283
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,550
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the leading edge there are some</font>

284
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:52,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">charts on the web</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:55,060
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> show that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the ipv6</font>

286
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:58,150
deployments seem to be in the

287
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,400
asia-pacific<font color="#E5E5E5"> region or in the European</font>

288
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:03,220
region right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think that Europe</font>

289
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,790
I would I can't guess on a country but

290
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:10,590
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are an awful lot of activities</font>

291
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:14,800
within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> European sphere in the ipv6</font>

292
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:17,500
region yuet the US government many years

293
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,060
ago mandated that in order to sell to

294
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,690
the US government<font color="#CCCCCC"> you had to have</font>

295
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,849
equipment that was ipv6 capable and so

296
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,850
that did spur a lot of the development

297
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:29,860
for vendors particularly those vendors

298
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,990
that support the infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

299
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,700
build routers and other equipment that

300
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:38,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">are associated with telecommunications</font>

301
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:42,790
and data services to buy equipment that

302
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:44,740
was ipv6 capable however that<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't</font>

303
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:48,459
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those vendors and those</font>

304
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,960
companies had to deploy ipv6 it just

305
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,000
meant<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment had to be</font>

307
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,490
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways of encouraging the</font>

308
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:59,170
deployment of ipv6 and I hope I didn't

309
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,660
offend any country that feels that they

310
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,729
were in the forefront but<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh I think</font>

311
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:06,910
Japan was one of the very early ones in

312
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:10,450
Europe is now also has a lot of activity

313
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:13,209
in this area maybe I could could add to

314
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:15,460
that from what we see in our statistics

315
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:20,470
and they are of course available on the

316
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:23,410
website we do see a really high number

317
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,620
of requests for ipv6 addresses coming

318
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:28,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the regional internet registries</font>

319
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:31,600
specifically in Europe indeed we also

320
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:34,000
know that the really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> large</font>

321
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,649
countries in the world and that that

322
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,439
certainly would be India would

323
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:41,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">china they know that with the growth of</font>

324
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:44,349
the network they cannot satisfy the

325
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:47,889
needs with IP VIP v4 so quite early on

326
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:51,339
they have started great initiatives in

327
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:54,910
in deploying ipv6 now having<font color="#CCCCCC"> said that</font>

328
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:57,939
we do see a large numbers of requests

329
00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:00,009
coming in as for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ripe NCC</font>

330
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:02,469
for for Europe that doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

331
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:04,899
those addresses are also visible on the

332
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,509
network that they are deployed already

333
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:11,019
operationally but obviously people are

334
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:12,819
requesting them in preparation for some

335
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:17,170
activity they they might still have to

336
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:18,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">undertake so there is hope and the</font>

337
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason again we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing this today is</font>

338
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:24,759
to impress on you some some urgency that

339
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,939
the change will have to make will have

340
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:31,059
to be made<font color="#E5E5E5"> really soon what will happen</font>

341
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:33,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">if people ignore the the need they will</font>

342
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:35,079
come at some point to the regional

343
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:37,779
internet registries for more ipv4

344
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:40,269
addresses in about a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> from now we</font>

345
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:43,509
will say we are sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have any</font>

346
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:45,759
for you anymore you are certainly ready

347
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:49,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do ipv6 now aren't you and then that</font>

348
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,889
say oh no we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not um-hmm okay now how</font>

349
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,470
do we do what do we do and then there

350
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:55,660
will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a period of fear uncertainty</font>

351
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:58,389
doubt some panic for those people who

352
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:01,899
haven't been ahead and haven't haven't

353
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:03,879
done their homework at that time this is

354
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:07,240
a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> from monarch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> emmert in europe</font>

355
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:09,909
who am i am assuming you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what is I</font>

356
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,709
Anna's current expectation when it in

357
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:16,049
terms of when it will allocate the last

358
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:20,890
block to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RR IRS or the last five and</font>

359
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:22,750
winters ripe expect to run out ok so

360
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:28,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll answer for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the I Anna part of that</font>

361
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:32,710
question and we have seven blocks of

362
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:36,370
ipv4 addresses right now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iono</font>

363
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:38,950
is holding for allocation if I had a

364
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:41,739
crystal ball which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't but I'll</font>

365
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:45,850
pretend I have a crystal ball I would

366
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,809
expect that we would get the request for

367
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:50,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next two</font>

368
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:54,029
allocations which would leave five then

369
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:58,200
for the global policy sometime between

370
00:17:54,029 --> 00:18:01,470
now and the end of January of 2011 so

371
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:05,640
that means sometime in January there

372
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:09,029
would be the trigger point to say okay

373
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,640
we only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have five blocks of ipv4 dresses</font>

374
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:15,330
left it's now time to look at the global

375
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:18,210
policy we we the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iono are in</font>

376
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:20,850
communication very closely<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NRO</font>

377
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:24,440
and the various regional registries it

378
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:26,809
represents talking about a coordinated

379
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:31,590
distribution of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> last five</font>

380
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:33,600
dependent on when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last two that why</font>

381
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:36,389
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> holding in my block that are not</font>

382
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,809
under the global policy are distributed

383
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:41,909
so looking in the crystal ball again if

384
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:45,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">I give out to by the end of january i</font>

385
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:49,580
would say by sometime in early spring

386
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:54,240
2011 the last five would be allocated

387
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:56,129
and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your question monica when will</font>

388
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,630
the ripe<font color="#E5E5E5"> ncc one out or the regional</font>

389
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:04,380
registries that is uncertain we do some

390
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:06,240
predictions based on previous activities

391
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:11,100
previous number of requests coming in

392
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,950
for instance but that of course changes

393
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:16,559
from from week to week so we might see

394
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:21,600
some acceleration<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> county we are not</font>

395
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:24,330
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing that yet so my guess is at</font>

396
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,250
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point in time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the regional</font>

397
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,889
registries<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ripe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ncc in this case</font>

398
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:32,159
certainly will run<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of ipv4 addresses</font>

399
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:34,289
some point in the second half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of next</font>

400
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:36,559
year so that's I know that's very rough

401
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:39,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">but that's as as good as it gets today</font>

402
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,370
we have another online question what is

403
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:46,740
the cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> business bottom line this is</font>

404
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:48,689
expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't it not really we assume</font>

405
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:52,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the equipment that is in place</font>

406
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:56,610
today in the core network is already

407
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:59,570
capable of running ipv6 so this

408
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:01,439
basically then is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question of</font>

409
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:06,120
switching ipv6

410
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,879
of designing your network accordingly

411
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,779
your ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> network basically the cost is</font>

412
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:15,360
in manpower in some some training it's

413
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:17,460
not as<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult and as expensive as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

414
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,070
might think we have had reports from

415
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,320
from a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of let's say early</font>

416
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:26,009
adopters who wrote out ipv6 over there

417
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,950
their core network and they said the

418
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:30,809
main fear was before we did it

419
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,120
afterwards we said it could have been

420
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:34,559
much much worse we should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done it</font>

421
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,879
much earlier because it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

422
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:40,408
worth that much fear so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there</font>

423
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:43,080
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple costs that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font>

424
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:45,570
consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one is the cost of starting</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> incrementally be prepared for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:51,418

427
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:54,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">as you plan any sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of business expense</font>

428
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:56,759
and you can leverage<font color="#E5E5E5"> it over time</font>

429
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:59,490
because it's not like you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

430
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:01,320
run into a brick wall tomorrow you're

431
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,690
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a period of time to plan</font>

432
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,570
this transition and you can then plan

433
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:09,090
your expense and your expenditures if

434
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:11,189
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide to wait till you run into the</font>

435
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,860
brick wall then it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

436
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,840
expensive because then what you're going

437
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">to really try to do is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to upgrade</font>

438
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,389
lots of things all at the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

439
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:24,959
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have to have a rather</font>

440
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:26,908
urgent transition plan or an

441
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,950
interoperability plan because you're

442
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to want your v4 network to be able</font>

443
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:34,860
to talk to your v6 network and so that's

444
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,360
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> expensive and at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

445
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,479
point in time then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you run into your</font>

446
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">legacy support costs because no one</font>

447
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,950
expects to rip out everything all the

448
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:47,070
equipment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end users that are</font>

449
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:51,990
using v4 equipment right away so it's

450
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:54,960
really you have a range of costs you can

451
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:56,730
expend a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money at the end by</font>

452
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,639
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do it in an urgent</font>

453
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,440
situation and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll also have to</font>

454
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:03,959
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the support and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost for</font>

455
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,080
maintaining the the parallel systems the

456
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,629
v4 in the v6 or you can start now<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

457
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,720
it's less urgent and have incremental

458
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:14,039
investments and I think there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

459
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,950
service providers that have been wise

460
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:17,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that</font>

461
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:20,650
started that way and have spread the

462
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:23,020
costs across a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years so it is</font>

463
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:25,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">expensive but then the costs of not</font>

464
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,760
doing it are more expensive in my

465
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:30,280
opinion at least you seem to be saying

466
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,220
this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> direction that it's going</font>

467
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,960
you're going to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> money eventually</font>

468
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,190
spend now it's less more in the future

469
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,440
is that too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much of an</font>

470
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:40,120
oversimplification no I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

471
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,640
too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an oversimplification but</font>

472
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,500
it's kind of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> buying something on</font>

473
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,540
layaway I don't know if they still<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

474
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,640
that anymore but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

475
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:51,430
go into a store at least in the US and

476
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,800
if it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> big-ticket item you'd say</font>

477
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'm going to put down $25 this</font>

478
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:59,919
month and<font color="#E5E5E5"> $25 next month and eventually</font>

479
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:02,860
in a year I'll have<font color="#CCCCCC"> paid for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and so</font>

480
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,200
what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying is if you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a plan</font>

481
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you invest incrementally it's less</font>

482
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,560
expensive than if you wait till the end

483
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you have to have a massive capital</font>

484
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,240
investment we have another question from

485
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">Monica in Europe what kind of failures</font>

486
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,040
do you think end customers will see

487
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:20,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">after v four numbers run out will they</font>

488
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,830
understand what happens to them so i

489
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:26,590
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end user customers will</font>

490
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:28,980
probably not understand why they can't

491
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,699
resolve and reach a certain server

492
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,410
probably they won't know the word

493
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,290
resolve unless they're involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

494
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:37,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">industry and so they'll call their</font>

495
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:39,610
customer support people the customer

496
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,010
support people will say<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh my we have a</font>

497
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:45,669
connectivity problem they probably won't

498
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:47,140
blame it on ipv4 or ipv6 and some of the

499
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:50,560
types of failures that it could have

500
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:52,900
caused<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are within the service</font>

501
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,970
provider themselves they may not have

502
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:58,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">done certain things for the DNS system</font>

503
00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:03,310
that need to be done so if you have ipv6

504
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:06,940
only customers DNS has to have ipv6 glue

505
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:09,100
it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does a mapping so i</font>

506
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:11,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't go into it in too much detail but</font>

507
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:15,490
ipv4 glue exists<font color="#E5E5E5"> today it's a</font>

508
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,620
configuration it's nothing special you

509
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:20,440
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need new equipment anything like</font>

510
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:23,199
that it's a configuration parameter so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

511
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:27,160
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> early deployments when you have</font>

512
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:30,070
more ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6i excuse me more ipv6 users</font>

513
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:34,000
it will show that some of these

514
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:37,080
infrastructure things will not

515
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,370
necessarily have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been ready and that</font>

516
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,340
configurations will have to be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

517
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">your technical staff to everything you</font>

518
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,080
may find that there are only some

519
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,820
servers that only support ipv4 and so

520
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,949
there'll be some content that you only

521
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:54,580
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to with ipv4 and if you have an</font>

522
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:56,440
ipv6 address the infrastructure people

523
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,449
are going to have to either put in some

524
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,470
sort of network address translation so

525
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:04,810
your ipv6 address can talk to this ipv4

526
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:07,240
only address or it could very well be

527
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:10,659
that people will put two addresses on

528
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:13,330
boxes that are offering services they're

529
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:16,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">not enough ipv4 addresses to put two</font>

530
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:18,720
addresses everywhere but on services

531
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:22,450
that people want to reach for instance

532
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:27,430
Google today all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their servers if you</font>

533

do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything double w google com you can</font>

534
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:33,070
get it to it either by v6 or by v4 so

535
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,840
those kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of services and</font>

536
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:37,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure things have to be taken</font>

537
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:41,260
into account in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the service provider or</font>

540
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:50,500
bit back to the costs and breakages and

541
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:52,439
connect them some people think for

542
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,840
instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have a business now</font>

543

continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run your business internal</font>

00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,889
the external part of your external

549

facing network that would have to be in

550

ipv6 to make it accessible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the rest</font>

551
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:23,409

upgrade everything and today ipv4

553
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:29,590
networks businesses have requested a

00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:33,720
portion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ipv4 address pool to be</font>

00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:40,270
ipv4 addresses that are not routed

557
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:41,889
globally they're only used for internal

558
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:44,889
private networks so you

559
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:48,910
could think of going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward that the IP</font>

00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:51,070
the entire ipv4 address pool could

561
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:53,950
become private space for businesses and

562
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:56,050
it's only ipv6 that might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

and no changes for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end user and but</font>

573
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:27,639
what I have heard in various discussions

574
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:30,730
with the technical community that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

575
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:34,060
are indeed some positive changes by

576
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:37,120
using IP 46 just let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> give an example</font>

577
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:40,389
and please correct me if I'm wrong if

578
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:44,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">you maybe buy a printer printer which is</font>

579
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:49,600
serving IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six addresses might be</font>

580
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:52,929
able to do much more as a printers able

581
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,870
to do now maybe he my serve as a fax or

582
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:57,670
something like this could<font color="#E5E5E5"> you please</font>

583
00:27:54,870 --> 00:28:03,090
tell us if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is right or if I'm wrong</font>

584
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:06,880
informed<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that</font>

585
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:11,889
functionally ipv6 is very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> similar</font>

586
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:18,640
to ipv4 so a change like that I don't

587
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:20,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">see coming what we will see is a an</font>

588
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,560
increase the potential at least for

589
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:27,149
increased transparency in the network

590
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:30,810
now what we see for many many years

591
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:34,200
partially brought forward by the

592
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:36,610
shortage of ipv4 addresses is that many

593
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,760
networks deployed network address

594
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:43,060
translator so we're internally you can

595
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,820
hide in a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your network to the</font>

596
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:48,700
against the outside world by using such

597
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:51,760
a device so you use as Lisa said

598
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:54,220
internally private address space and you

599
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,750
only show one address to the outside

600
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:59,200
that is publicly visible

601
00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:01,600
now that will not be necessary with ipv6

602
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,230
because there are so many addresses so

603
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,810
in theory you can have every single

604
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,790
device on your internal network be

605
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:13,679
visible to the outside world if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

606
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:16,570
choose so there might be functional

607
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,580
improvements in that that you can target

608
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:21,570
your your printer from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside world</font>

609
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:24,610
much much easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> then then you currently</font>

610
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:26,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't I think that that is something</font>

611
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:28,090
that that ever would agree that there is

612
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:31,840
some there could be some functional

613
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:33,010
improvements despite your calls do you

614
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,909
think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to end up in a</font>

615
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:38,470
situation where people won't act in time

616
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:40,690
what would happen in that case how

617
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:43,090
dramatic with the effect be I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

618
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:45,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a lot like the y2k situation</font>

619
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:47,649
where people were worried that<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

620
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,570
were going to break I'm sorry Axl is

621
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:52,330
looking at me like in question when we

622
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:55,480
went from the night the 20th century to

623
00:29:52,330 --> 00:30:00,100
the 21st century<font color="#E5E5E5"> world over from 1990</font>

624
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:02,110
year 2000 so just like everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

625
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,780
there was a lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> for consultants</font>

626
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:07,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years driving up to the year</font>

627
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:10,389
2000 and I think it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really be</font>

628
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:15,909
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> big time for consultants in ipv4 and</font>

629
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:17,410
ipv6 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not one of the ones that</font>

630
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,920
really believe that there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

631
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:23,650
a total breakdown there may be parts

632
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:28,270
that need to be fixed but I think

633
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:30,100
they're fixable and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

634
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:32,889
know I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think there's going to</font>

635
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:36,129
be meltdown<font color="#E5E5E5"> Axl how about you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

636
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:37,690
meltdown yeah that's that's why I looked

637
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:40,870
at you a little bit funny from from the

638
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:43,960
side I don't I don't see this as a case

639
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:46,479
of y2k in functionality no the internet

640
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,550
is not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stop we have a running</font>

641
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet today and once we run out of</font>

642
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:53,139
numbers in your organization in my

643
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,030
organization that doesn't change that we

644
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,300
still have a running internet at the

645
00:30:55,030 --> 00:31:00,490
time there might be problems but those

646
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,190
problems will be incremental where we

647
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:05,679
have no edit bits here and edit bits

648
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,510
there and then a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of ipv6 a</font>

649
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,730
little bit of ipv4 and then there might

650
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,350
be some small

651
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,780
is popping up that can be those can be

652
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:14,580
solved but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not going to oh my god</font>

653
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet isn't working anymore kind</font>

654
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,178
of problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> no so I saw what you're</font>

655
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,010
saying is all those journalists who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

656
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:21,600
online<font color="#E5E5E5"> who've written the lead internet</font>

657
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:24,540
about to collapse have to rework that

658
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,699
that top of that story right as long as

659
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,950
it's just the the top is fine because it

660
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,400
gets gets people to read it and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

661
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:33,750
know it's not as bad as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might think</font>

662
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:37,860
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another question from Monica in</font>

663
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:40,260
Europe has me secure as I Anna a role to

664
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:43,370
promote better ipv6 connection to

665
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:46,860
tier-one operators that sometimes fail

666
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:48,719
fail their downstream customers as we

667
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:52,610
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the right meeting um I think</font>

668
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:56,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">the I Anna's role is to promote the</font>

669
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:59,449
evolution of the use of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet numbers</font>

670
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,830
and protocol parameters and the

671
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:05,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">evolution of the domain name system and</font>

672
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:09,389
the universal connectivity and resolve

673
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,240
ability so at that's more of a promotion

674
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:15,809
role than any other role I think at this

675
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:19,260
point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that by</font>

676
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:21,960

both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you when you travel when you</font>

688
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,690
these journalists today what comes back

689
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,209
at you what sort of reception are you

690
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:59,220
getting are people saying wow we didn't

691

<font color="#E5E5E5">realize this we didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> realize that this</font>

692
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:12,530
transition is on the horizon what are

693
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:15,330
you hearing I get more and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm</font>

694
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:18,299
knowledge back that that people are

695
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:20,720
awareness let's say that that folks are

696
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:22,530
aware that something is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen</font>

697
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,210
they have heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

698
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:26,129
they might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the details but</font>

699
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,760
something is going to happen and that's

700
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:31,260
that's talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the general</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> public</font>

701
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,960
looking at the network operators they

702
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:37,290
know they know their you must be a

703
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:41,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">really tiny network operator tucked away</font>

705
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:47,030
order to have missed this now we have as

706
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:50,160
Lisa start and say we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these these</font>

707
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:54,210
conferences all over the place the

708
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:56,820
network operators groups they come and

709
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to to each other for so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many years</font>

710
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:02,450
already we have started<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole track</font>

711
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:05,730
towards ipv6 more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and</font>

712
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:07,530
over the last let's say three years we

713
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:10,710
do see a significant increase in

714
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:13,168
awareness in action as well and as

715
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:15,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">Monica has said yes there was a ripe</font>

meeting recently where some some

717
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:19,980
problems were talked about and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

718
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:24,299
exactly the role that that those

719
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:26,429
conferences play people<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs network</font>

720
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,310
operators need to exchange their

721
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:31,860
experiences with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the roller of ipv6 and</font>

722
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,989
all other operational issues and as long

723
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,790
as they do that they will find little

724
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:37,049
little errors little mistakes and then

725
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:39,320
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix them they can address that</font>

726
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:41,220
and that's the the benefit of of

727
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:46,530
communications and talking to each other

728
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:48,719
really I think I hear what you do you

729
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:51,840
get knowledge back but lately I think

730
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,759
them some of the comments I hear the

731
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:57,750
most are mostly about the cost and the

732
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:01,400
concerns and the concerns that even

733
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:06,350
though the vendors of big infrastructure

734
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:10,110
types stuff like routers and switches

735
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:13,020
they've they're prepared they've gone

736
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:16,020
and implemented both protocols ipv4 and

737
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:19,350
ipv6 it's the equipment that's closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

738
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:21,210
the user that's that the real worrisome

739
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:23,880
piece for a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and how are</font>

740
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:27,630
they going to do that so laptops are

741
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:30,870
typically set up so they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be v4 v6</font>

742
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:33,300
capable but then there's some in home

743
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:35,220
routers that a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have not</font>

744
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,120
all of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are capable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of both</font>

745
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:39,270
protocols

746
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:42,390
weeds and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of equipment like</font>

747
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:45,180
that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the big service</font>

748
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:47,910
providers and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop that</font>

749
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:50,339
everybody's worried about and how will

750
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:53,069
those vendors catch up and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

751
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:56,310
get not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service providers but</font>

752
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:58,650
homeowners to maybe update their

753
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:02,310
equipment so that it's more modern and

754
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:05,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is a more challenging issue</font>

755
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:08,580
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least in the US you</font>

756
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:11,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we've switched from regular TV to</font>

757
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:13,440
HDTV now and I was one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slow</font>

758
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,510
adopters there and so I was not

759
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,490
beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get television stations and</font>

760
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:21,450
things like that until we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to go out</font>

761
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:23,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">and buy a new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TV so I think individual</font>

763
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,720
point in time that they have a lot of

764
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:29,700
legacy equipment and those legacy

765
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,069
vendors may or may not have kept up and

766
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,859
that's our you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concern I hear</font>

767
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:36,480
when I'm hearing people talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me now</font>

768
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:39,240
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we have a question in the</font>

785
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:28,020
is capable of both and most of the

786
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:32,779
equipment today supports both the v4 and

787
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:38,040
the v6 and that allows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have the</font>

788
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:42,000
the interoperability for customers that

789
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:44,190
won't be supporting v6 yet and you'll be

790
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,970
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grow your services your native</font>

791
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:49,730
services on ipv6 so you can connect to

792
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:52,640
both the v4

793
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:56,810
customers as well as the v6 and most

794
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:58,790
equipment supports both today and I

795
00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:01,609
would only select vendors that would

796
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:04,160
support both do you have anything to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

797
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:07,009
in closing basically the stories if you

798
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:12,910
haven't deployed ipv6 now you have about

799
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:12,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">a year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it without pain do it now</font>

800
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:21,080
I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that it's sort of like</font>

801
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:23,420
choosing between feast and famine so you

802
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:26,480
could decide to starve yourself and stay

803
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:29,090
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ipv4 world or you could decide to</font>

804
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,710
go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have a feast and have as much</font>

805
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:33,830
as you want and you could eat as much as

806
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:38,330
you want you know because I be v6 has

807
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:40,299
that many addresses available and the

808
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:42,080
Internet's all been about innovation

809
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:46,369
everything that's happened in the last

810
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:48,290
25 years was totally unexpected and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

811
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:50,780
you choose famine basically you're

812
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:52,250
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick</font>

813
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:55,160
with the status quo<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't expect</font>

814
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:56,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything new to ever happen whereas if</font>

815
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:00,009
you go for feast you've got the

816
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,010
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that innovation</font>
