lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the work that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do is</font>

essentially technical much of it

00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,030
legalistic and some of it philosophical

we're all part of something much bigger

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:33,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">so much okay so but having said that so</font>

28
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:36,830
here comes here it comes we're still not

29
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:40,160
confident that the benefits to be

30
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:43,250
derived from this are going to outweigh

31
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,490
the costs we worked hard we've gone

32
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,869
through the detail we've consulted

33
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:51,020
stakeholders we've listened to what

34
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:53,360
people in the community of saying and we

35
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,490
think you're not there you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,410
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a lot of valuable work you're</font>

37
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,750
putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of effort into it in a</font>

38
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:05,929
very open<font color="#E5E5E5"> way but you're not there I</font>

39
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:07,640
wonder is there any any guidelines from

40
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:10,340
those countries who say we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

41
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,680
yet as to what when we will know or when

42
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">you will know we are there I think we</font>

43
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">will know whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're they're all</font>

44
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,440
getting very near there when we when we

45
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,420
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those benefits do</font>

46
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,000
outweigh the costs we are held

47
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,309
accountable to our governments and to

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,140
our citizens<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we are actually held</font>

49
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,700
accountable each<font color="#E5E5E5"> and every one of us and</font>

50
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,350
there is an expectation that's quite

51
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,480
legitimate that there will be some

52
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:39,500
return on this investment the question

53
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,810
is how is it shaped and this leads<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

54
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,750
to the global benefit of opening up

55
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,819
versus not opening up it goes to whether

56
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:49,840
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is undue burden to certain</font>

57
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:52,609
categories of actors because the

58
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,830
cost-benefit ratio is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only on a</font>

59
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,620
global scale it's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> for different</font>

60
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:00,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">categories it is generally extremely</font>

61
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,300
difficult to estimate the value of

62
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:06,839
innovation that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a general</font>

63
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:09,420
economic research issue because it's

64
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,030
are difficult to unpredictable future as

65
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,970
opposed the forecast of all conventional

66
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,650
feature that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know from history</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

67
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,050
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder whether hither you know if</font>

68
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,330
we schedule today or Diana half or two

69
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,950
days at some stage between now and San

Francisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might that might work</font>

71
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:29,369
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're very well for the board</font>

72
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,290
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> to grips with these issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font>

73
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:35,280
you for that suggestion I see it a

74
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:37,950
little bit of nodding so i think that

75
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">means that we are open to doing that and</font>

76
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:58,260
we appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the offer to to continue</font>

77
00:03:42,599 --> 00:04:01,109
in that spirit like to thank you for

78
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,359
joining our news conference on ipv6 it's

79
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,099
an incredibly important issue i know is

80
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,790
that many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have not covered this</font>

81
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:11,190
issue before if you haven't you will in

82
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:16,139
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very near future if you think about</font>

83
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:18,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP addresses like you know telephone</font>

84
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,239
numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what you're saying is</font>

85
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,889
ipv4 is going to run out of numbers so

86
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:25,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't have any more phone numbers</font>

87
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:27,479
and that's what it's doing for computers

88
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,070
and the systems that connect them for

89
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:32,099
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet this is something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

90
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,139
needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be deployed now urgently you</font>

91
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:37,530
really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something if you are</font>

web shop on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet you need to be</font>

95
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,440
on ipv6 because at some point you will

96
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,109
be losing parts of the internet if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

97
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,599
are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> and about a year from now we</font>

98
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,450
will say we are sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have any</font>

99
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:59,909
for you anymore so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is expensive but</font>

100
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:03,080
then the costs of not doing it are more

101
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,080
expensive in my opinion

102
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,549
this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most exciting times</font>

103
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:15,069
of the of the week at I can this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

for you this is public comment to make

your positions known all the nonsense

108
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:25,179

trademark and abuse price protection

110
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:29,979
over the last few years is to do with

111
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:32,229
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one thing only that's</font>

112
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:34,659
protecting the reputation of those who

113
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:39,909
are currently doing business all we're

114
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:43,329
trying to do is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure a set of new</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">TLDs that allows benefits to come out</font>

119
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:56,079
it mildly is the same individuals taking

120
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:58,329
every opportunity at every microphone to

121
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,219
spew out the same scaremongering based

122
00:05:58,329 --> 00:06:02,289
on no foundation and which has been

123
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:04,629
discounted over and over again<font color="#E5E5E5"> for many</font>

124
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:07,058
years I have heard nothing new for so

125
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:09,309
long I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that comment came because</font>

126
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:11,229
I'm hearing people object to hearing

127
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:13,689
from others and it's important we

128

continue to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can is not in the</font>

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:16,500
that's the ICM registry application for

181
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,320
fairly clear the board would like to

knows that it needs to have a

184
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,430
consultation with the GAC so that seems

to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> appropriate mechanism for</font>
