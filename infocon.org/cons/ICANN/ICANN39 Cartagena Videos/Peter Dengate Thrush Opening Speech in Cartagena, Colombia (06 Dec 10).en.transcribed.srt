Columbia and the minister explained that

such as the beauty of the women of

18

what do we do it I can why are we here

00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,550
why have we all come together this week

27
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,690
to talk about the internet and so I

28
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,210
thought I might look back a little bit

29
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:34,539
in time to find some of the roots of the

30
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:38,830
answer and coincidentally<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this very</font>

31
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:40,840
day in 1768 the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Encyclopedia Britannica</font>

00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:43,090

<font color="#CCCCCC">sixty pages 160 pictures so 240 years</font>

of the earliest attempts to collect and

00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,559
codify all of human knowledge and to

38
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,729
share this information with the world

39

who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who could afford</font>

40
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:03,069
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it costs 12 pounds sterling</font>

dollars today and not everybody was

43
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:10,590
happy with its publication and just like

44
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,180
some aspects of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of today</font>

45
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,030
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that knowledge bothered some of</font>

46
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,910
the people so King George the third of

47
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,270
England ordered three pages highlighting

48
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,290
human anatomy ripped out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of every book</font>

49
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:30,160
which struck me as<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps being the</font>

50
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:32,680
first triple Xing of information but

<font color="#E5E5E5">despite the concerns the vivid pros and</font>

52
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,580
the easy navigation of that first

53
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,640
edition led to a strong demand for a

54
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,140
second and so what started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with two</font>

55
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,750
thousand seven hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixty pages</font>

56
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,640
grew to<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty two volumes more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than six</font>

57
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,160
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> sixty five thousand articles and</font>

58

volumes got a little cheaper you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font>

62
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,190
it now for about two hundred dollars or

63
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,620
you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> online and you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get all of</font>

of the important work that I can does

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,750
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to find as we go things</font>

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,460
platform for a future that some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

76
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,040
could only imagine what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened in</font>

77
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,420
fiction and I thought knowing that I and

78
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,250
many of the people I've met over the

79
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,109
years that I can a<font color="#CCCCCC"> science fiction fans</font>

80
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:42,070
I would then look perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> to science</font>

81
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:44,650
fiction for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more authority the idea</font>

83
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:51,070

00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,160
compendium of all the information then

90
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,600
Encyclopedia Britannica it was conceived

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,850
and published as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical book and as</font>

92
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,829
it evolved as society evolved it was

93
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,769
eventually computerized quite an

94
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:17,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">important word in those years and then</font>

95
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:18,548
the Encyclopedia Galactica concept was

96
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:22,179
picked up by<font color="#CCCCCC"> an American philosopher</font>

97
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:26,049
scientist Carl Sagan and in his

98
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:28,300
groundbreaking work in 1980 cosmos he

99
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,000
imagined the Encyclopedia Galactica as a

100
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,530
place<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a hypothetical</font>

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,620
extraterrestrial organization to store

102
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,479
its knowledge but I'm tempted to think

103
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,970
that in the works of fiction that we're

104
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,010
familiar with the best capturing of the

105
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,480
full genius of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

106
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,659
very much more serious work the

107
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,100
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy and so

108
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">I quote from the British author of their</font>

109
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,090
Douglas Adams and he described the

110
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,860
Hitchhiker's Guide and said that had

111
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,289
already supplanted the Encyclopedia

112
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,180
Galactica as the standard repository of

113
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,800
all knowledge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wisdom for though it</font>

114
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,050
has many emissions and contains much

115
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,360
that is apocryphal or at least wildly

116
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,919
inaccurate it scores over the older more

117
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,200
pedestrian work and two important

118
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,960
respects first it's slightly cheaper and

119
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,120
second it has the words don't panic

120
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">inscribed and large and friendly letters</font>

121
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,979
on the cover so I thought well he is

122
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,680
cheaper and sometimes inaccurate

123
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:21,449
perfectly describes in

124
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,479
servation you can get over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet</font>

125
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:26,490

153
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,979
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that work we've seen some</font>

154
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,930
incredible successes for example our

155
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,810
internationalized domain name program in

156
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,280
the ccTLD space and this week you'll

157
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,139
hear much more about the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cyrillic</font>

158

extension for the Russian<font color="#E5E5E5"> foundation</font>

159
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,610
which since its launch has<font color="#E5E5E5"> become one of</font>

160
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,139
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> largest registries they expected a</font>

hundred thousand registrations in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

162

and less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a month yeah exactly</font>

164
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:59,740
I know the people who said well you know

165
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,169
do we really need some<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

166
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,400
really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore top-level domains so</font>

167
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,080
that's an amazing and incredible

168
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,640
testament to people's desire to have

169
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,289
domain names that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in the characters</font>

00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">of their own languages of their own</font>

171
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:12,430
scripts from beginning to end we're also

172
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,409
going to have a lot of opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

173
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,900
discuss further refinements to our

179
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,960
program we started in 2000 we did a

180
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,520
small release we learn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and we</font>

181
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,140
did another release and now we're

185
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,230
name space so we'll be hashing over what

186
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,910
we hope to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the proposed final</font>

round the third round of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new gtld</font>

190
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:51,580

00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,990
limitless opportunities for new
