00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:10,530
for talking to us helping us get a feel

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,040
for the actions of the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> and help</font>

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,690
summarize what those active actions were

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,369
Peter let's start with you it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was widely</font>

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought that the ICANN board would</font>

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,630
finally approve the launch of new

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,630
generic top-level domains of this

11
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,849
meeting yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> again much to the dismay of</font>

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,669
many of your own<font color="#CCCCCC"> community members that</font>

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,170
didn't happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> why well we're talking</font>

14
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,940
about the live running internet and

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,440
making very dramatic changes to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,510
that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to do right</font>

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,670
rather than fast we've had a lot of

18
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,079
concern from members of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community</font>

19
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,640
including governments of the world that

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's still some concerns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

21
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,110
want sorted out before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go live now</font>

22
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,519
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only responsible thing for us to do</font>

23
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,809
in the face of that message from<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,520
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are still matters</font>

25
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">of concern is to come up with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

26
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,120
for looking at that and resolving it and

27
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,469
we've done that we have arranged a

28
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,449
meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the government's in</font>

29
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,219
February which will hopefully resolve

30
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,449
their remaining issues but I think most

31
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,129
the communities are it pleased we've

32
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,750
actually closed off or signal the

33
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,158
closing off a whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues which</font>

34
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,020
they can now put behind them as they're

35
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,549
settled and the fact that we're closing

36
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,839
in on the remaining issues and that

37
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,520
we've got a process for<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

38
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,869
those with the government's I think the

39
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,920
reaction I've had since the meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

40
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,200
the most people are pleased with the

41
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,000
progress we've made let me follow up

42
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,920
there that the the decision of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board</font>

43
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,060
not to move forward with the launch of

44
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,650
new gTLDs occurred against a backdrop of

45
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,180
ICANN having received a very critical

46
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,689
letter from the US<font color="#CCCCCC"> Department of</font>

47
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,250
Commerce how big of a factor was that in

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,289
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Board's decision to kick this down</font>

49
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,729
the road well that was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

50
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,350
comments that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came in as part of the</font>

51
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,060
community comments in relation to the

53
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,210
way I can't does things we put material

54
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,220
out for comment and the comment comes

55
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,240
back when it comes back of course we

56
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,770
that we then have to take it very

57
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,298
seriously and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

58
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be part of the process</font>

59

as we move<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward to that meeting in</font>

60
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,130
February considering those issues and

61
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,810
looking at the materials looking at the

62
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,479
community response and eventually making

63
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,659
a proper decision on that Peter will the

64
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,429
februari meeting be open well we haven't

65
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually resolved the rules of</font>

is that they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> open that's</font>

one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the parties thinks that the</font>

74
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,130
negotiation would be assisted by a

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,829
period<font color="#E5E5E5"> of discussing things in private</font>

76
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,480
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I guess we could consider that</font>

77
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,120
your gak seems to be sing to the Lord

78
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,000
we've been talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want our input</font>

79
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,920
we've been given you our input you say

80
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,720
you're listening to us but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

81
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,000
the day you make decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that seem to</font>

82
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,070
indicate you didn't hear us at all is

83
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,620
there a break down here no but look<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

84
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:43,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that is a feature of I can we get</font>

85
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:48,160
public comment from enormous range of

86
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,240
institutions and people and we think we

87
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,220
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably do a better job of</font>

88
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,080
explaining our decisions and so one of

89
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,730
the things we've we've tasked the staff

90
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,400
without this meeting is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spend a</font>

91
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,299
bit more time publishing the rationales

92
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,709
criticisms because everybody wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

93
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">know you know why we've made the</font>

94
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,510
decisions we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have and I I think we've</font>

95
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,859
always taken a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trouble to to</font>

96
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,019
explain ourselves but I think we could

97
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,090
probably do a bit better right let me

98
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you assuming let's take a</font>

99
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,980
hypothetical here that the board says in

100
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:18,280
San Francisco at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next public meeting</font>

101
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,799
yes we're good go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and launch new</font>

102
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,800
gTLDs you're the man in charge of

103
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,570
implementation is I can't read sure as

104
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,610
long as the program is largely as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

105
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,859
been outlined so far and there's not

106
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,780
major structural changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what would</font>

107
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">be approved by the board the answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

108
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,250
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you both have said that most of the</font>

109
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,840
major issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been resolved you're</font>

110
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,070
going to be in February to resolve some

111
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,170
of the few remaining issues

112
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,720
characterized as minor what type of

113
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,480
issues exactly well they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

114
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,609
minor so that there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list is</font>

115
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,018
smaller than it ever was one of the one

116
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,970
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as we've been</font>

117
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">tasked the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> communities call on us to do</font>

118
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,989
economic studies and in fact we've done

119
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,429
five economic studies so one of our

120
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:00,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">decisions we're not going to get any</font>

121
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,470
more useful information<font color="#E5E5E5"> from further</font>

122
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,569
economic studies what we now need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

123
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,489
is spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of time doing</font>

124
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:07,319
analysis of those studies so we're

125
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,730
closing off the prospect of further

126
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,530
studies I mean you could keep we could

127
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,578
do study always do more but we've

128
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,620
reached that we think the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

129
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:15,239
diminishing returns on that well we now

130
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,829
need to concentrate is on the analysis

131
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,418
similarly with the other issues we've

132
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,699
done a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and trying to protect</font>

the fundamental policy positions when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of time with the trademark community and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">often the case that a simple consensus</font>

176
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:56,800
the board is important to have a body

00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,760
we don't like each other it's because

301
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,170
we've got many other constituencies in

302
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,020
stakeholder groups so there's many

303

<font color="#E5E5E5">different voices here and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

of a better word a test case of its

accountability procedure procedures and

311
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:45,000
measures is it passing that test

312
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,709
I think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I think I said earlier</font>

transparency and I've started both a

336
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,060
top-down effort in the organization took

337

one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my vice presidents and made her</font>

accountability transparency showing my

top down commitment and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

341
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:54,089
a bottom-up process to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization</font>

342
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,440
and we have dozens<font color="#CCCCCC"> of projects and</font>

00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:57,389
initiatives we've done one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of which we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">just launched here which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font>

00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:07,079
there's more than 900 and cited what

00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:09,029
actions have been taken to fulfill those

349
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,388
resolutions and linking related

350
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:13,410
documents exactly the kind of thing the

affirmation of commitments itself asked

352
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,579
for so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can always get</font>

353
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:20,699
better every organization can improve

and we continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on that and at</font>

355
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:24,089
the same time though one has to

356
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,949
recognize the tremendous accomplishments

357
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:27,540
of this board staff and community and

358
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:29,219
what they've built over the last 12
