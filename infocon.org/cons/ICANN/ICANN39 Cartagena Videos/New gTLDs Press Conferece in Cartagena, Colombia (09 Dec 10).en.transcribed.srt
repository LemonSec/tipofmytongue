8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,640
last year and a half analyzing public

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,900
comment and the issues associated with

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,850
the launch of new top-level domains and

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,269
very specifically dived into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues</font>

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,390
that have been raised by the community

I'm not continues this week that a

using to voice comments to the board and

of the community the board is actively

determine what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the prerequisites for</font>

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,130
launching it current is it an

31
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,770
oversimplification to say that the board

32
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,170
will be considering the<font color="#E5E5E5"> manner and the</font>

33
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,750
timing of a launch rather than whether

34
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,009
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not gTLDs are going to happen it's a</font>

35
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,829
given that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen or is</font>

36
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:45,290
that an oversimplification is so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

37
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:47,639
can as a complicated place so

38
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:50,070
simplifications are dangerous and the

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,180
board has a wide range of options<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

40
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,008
to it and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know will as I said will</font>

41
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,810
determine the prerequisites for launch

42
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,670
and those prerequisites will have to be

43
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,610
satisfied<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the process is launched</font>

44
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,750
and can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us any market</font>

45
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:09,840
differences in the latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> most recent</font>

46

draft of the applicant<font color="#E5E5E5"> guidebook so the</font>

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,640
the current the current version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

48
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,370
guidebook

49
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,559
really addresses refinements to the

50
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,920
process so what we continue to analyze

51
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,909
comment and continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comment</font>

52
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,450
you know analyze it and make

53
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:29,790
accommodations where that those

54
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:34,470
accommodations are indicated so there's

55
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:36,780
more protections for geographical names

56
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,260
or or names protected by<font color="#E5E5E5"> treaty</font>

57
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,540
organizations there's more malicious

58
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,548
conduct mitigation measures through

59
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:49,620
refined background checks processes are

60
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:51,000
detailed more so applicants have more

61
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,970
certainty about what their requirements

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,730
are and how they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass the process so</font>

63
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:59,790
I would I would term the the changes to

64
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,500
the guidebook to be refinement some

65
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,019
improvement suggested by the community

66
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">and efforts to provide more clarity for</font>

67
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:10,019
those who want to apply a question from

there are some late comers to the

does not it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense for I can</font>

to ignore valuable comments like that so

85
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,620
you know where it's not like a

take place what has happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> this week</font>

108
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:24,450
at this meeting with regards to new

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:27,340
gTLDs and their potential launch lot

110
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:30,640
we've had several sessions on new gTLDs

111
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:33,669
that where the the members of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet communities raised you know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">came to the microphone and made several</font>

114
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:42,910
points we had one session to discuss the

so-called overarching issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

116
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:48,010
overarching issues were raised after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

117
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:51,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">first version</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the guide book was</font>

118
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,510
published as you pointed out or was

119
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:58,900
printed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the question some time ago</font>

120
00:05:52,510 --> 00:06:02,550
and concerned that you know were

121
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:05,489
concerned that trademark protections

122
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:09,070
mitigation of malicious conduct measures

123
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:11,770
economic studies and and the stability

124
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:14,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the root zone were all considered in</font>

125
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:17,400
the guidebook and in that interim this

126
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:21,609
community came together and and

127
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:24,510
developed solutions for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all those issues</font>

128
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:27,070
or work was done on all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those issues and</font>

129
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,289
through the community many of those

130
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:32,050
issues we think are are solved are very

131
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:35,200
very very close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> being self so we had</font>

132
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,950
a session on those overarching issues to

133
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,680
determine

134
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:41,170
what if any issues were outstanding or

135
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,360
additional improvements could be made on

136
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,310
some other issue working groups met on

137
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,040
other issues with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guidebook having</font>

138
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:52,180
to do with making<font color="#CCCCCC"> idns more usable so</font>

139
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,820
improvements could be made there in the

140
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:59,200
way new gTLDs and especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID ends</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">operate when they are launched in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

142
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:08,050

143
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:12,719
then finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see is you know the</font>

144
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:15,700
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> strong voices coming up that wish to</font>

145
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,520
use this opportunity as we get close to

146
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:22,090
launching to move the guidebook so

147

rather rather than comment really sort

00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,590
of diminishing towards the end to to a

149
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,920
whimper and then the guidebook being

150

launched we see it instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> it raising to</font>

151
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,630
a crescendo as all the parties who have

00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:39,730
legitimate interest and are acting very

online the process is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

159
00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:02,470
lengthy and the way that the process is

181
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:09,370
year or so ago we did some preliminary

182
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:11,170
studies into the marketplace and thought

183
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,680
there might be two hundred applications

through some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the background</font>

207
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:14,590
after I can publish the first version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

208
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:20,380
the guidebook that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in fact the approved</font>

209
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:23,560
policy had had a called out specifically

210
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,960
that no specific rights protection

211
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">mechanisms should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be required of all</font>

tlds but responding to public comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

213
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:35,440
can convened a group of intellectual

property experts within the i kin

215
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,990
community to develop a set of rights

216
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,300
protection mechanisms and they worked

217
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:46,600
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard and developed a very</font>

218
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:49,300
concrete reasonable product a suite of

219
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,870
intellectual property<font color="#E5E5E5"> protections that</font>

220
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:55,990
are now in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> agreement that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> product</font>

221
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,610
was then tested to see if it was in line

222
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,430
with the policy recommendations when it

223
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,910
was considered by a working group of gso

224
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:07,400
constituencies

225
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:09,620
so we have developed you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a suite of</font>

226
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,420
intellectual<font color="#CCCCCC"> property protection</font>

227
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,110
mechanisms that are that are in the

228
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:17,479
guidebook there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of debate still</font>

229
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,100
though about aspects of those property

230
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,740
protection mechanisms certain you know

231
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:25,390
the timing of them certain ways they're

232
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,390
implemented and whether they will

233
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:31,040
whether they will result in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real is</font>

234
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,630
eight you know whether they will result

235
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,449
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort of protections envisioned</font>

236
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,790
when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> develop there's a there's a</font>

237
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,830
question as to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> effectiveness of</font>

238
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,920
those property protection mechanisms

239
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:47,030
because until we<font color="#E5E5E5"> launch the process we</font>

240
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:49,099
will not know we will not know whether

241
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,780
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how effective they are and then</font>

242
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,760
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in testing their</font>

243
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,740
effectiveness I think the big the

244
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,680
largest area of discussion here has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

245
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:00,680
around defensive registrations and the

246
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,569
amount brand holders will have to invest

247
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:09,560
in making multiple registrations across

248
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:12,680
top-level domains there's that that

249
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,839
discussion goes from one side multiply

250
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,760
the the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of defensive</font>

251
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,460
registrations now by the number of two

252
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,689
new top-level domains and you get to a

253
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:25,040
pretty big number<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on the other side</font>

254
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,930
that's mitigated by the fact that the

255
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">offensive registrations are only made in</font>

256
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:34,609
the very largest registries so we'll new

257
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:36,800
new top-level<font color="#E5E5E5"> domains result in actual</font>

258
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,390
defensive registrations is uncertain<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

259
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,839
so that's the that's the span of

260
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:43,340
discussion that's occurring right now

261
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,260
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you come up with the hundred and</font>

262
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,580
eighty-five thousand dollar application

263
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">fee</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's the background on that number</font>

264
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a cost recovery model and it's and</font>

265
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,900
it has three aspects to it one is how

266
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:58,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">much is it going to cost to evaluate the</font>

267
00:12:53,900 --> 00:13:00,530
applications um so we took all of the

268
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">panel's i think there's six evaluation</font>

269
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:05,420
panels in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> initial evaluation so</font>

270
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:09,260
paying all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those evaluation panels</font>

271
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:11,479
and then there's you know potential for

272
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,030
extended review there's potential for

273
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,370
administration of other processes after

274
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,620
that

275
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,510
such as dispute resolution and you know

276
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:22,020
and burdening that so we added<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those</font>

277
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">costs together still still somewhat</font>

278
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:28,980
speculative because we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done that</font>

279
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:31,650
yet but pretty much those costs add up

280
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,330
to you know flat up up against our

281
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:37,500
budget and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's two other</font>

282
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:39,750
aspects<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the fee one is a recovery of</font>

283
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,690
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs that it was thought</font>

284
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:45,060
that existing registrants should not

285
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:48,779
have to pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the development of new</font>

286
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:52,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">TVs when you know others might others</font>

287
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:54,120
might benefit from that so we're going

288
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">to recover the development costs at the</font>

289
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:00,060
rate of twenty six thousand dollars per

290
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,650
application 25,000 until it's until

291
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,650
those costs are recovered and then

292
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:06,240

00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:20,910
undertake a study with us where we

298
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:24,719
identified all of the low probability

299
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:29,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">high-value bad things that could happen</font>

300
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,200
and calculated the value of those and

301
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,029
that came out to sixty thousand dollars

302
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,160
so a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> low probability in each</font>

306

high cost added those together so those

00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:48,029
are costs that are actually expected you

whether you know whether we were on with

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,319
those cost calculations or not but so at

the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day it's a it's a cost</font>
