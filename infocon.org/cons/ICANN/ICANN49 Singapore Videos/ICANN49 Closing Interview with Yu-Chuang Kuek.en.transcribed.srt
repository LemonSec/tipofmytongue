1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
you know I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> credit to</font>

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:06,779
the meeting

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,490
fantastic the energy level the

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,770
professionalism they brought to the

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,110
organization of these meetings I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,899
nothing but rave reviews of the work

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,480
they've done the team that is based in

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,669
Singapore has been working very hard as

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,189
well and I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> thankful for all of</font>

10
00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:26,429
them for working so hard and it's going

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,679
to fantastic meetings over and a lot of

12
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:30,598
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> staff was very new for the most part</font>

13
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:34,440
so not only do they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come into</font>

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,830
the new hub which also is very new they

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,540
had to come in and welcome look like a

16
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:41,820
more than 1,900 registrations for the

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,460
meeting actually you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

18
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,880
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting for everyone not everyone</font>

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,940
has had the opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fly up to LA</font>

20
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,440
or the other offices and if we didn't

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,720
have this meeting at some point of time

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,570
the thing that I'm just imagining that

23
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,790
we really had so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people from around</font>

24
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,980
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world but no on a more serious note</font>

25
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,019
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone is very energized by</font>

26
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,259
the fact that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can mutants are in</font>

27
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,960
Singapore and that you know with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot</font>

28
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:12,509
being based right here in the city that

29
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can host a global event like this we</font>

30
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:17,030
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very sorry</font>

31
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:20,250
describe the kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tasks</font>

32
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:22,860
responsibilities jobs you and your staff

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,140
had to do just list them over the last

34
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,060
couple of weeks I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really ranges</font>

35
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,220
from logistical arrangements that we

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,970
work very closely with a mutinous teen

37
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,590
with given that we have a newly set up

38
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,450
office in Singapore people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

39
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,920
excited to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the office and making</font>

40
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody gets an opportunity</font>

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,540
to see the Singapore heart I think

42
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,760
that's another from a Content

43
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,560
perspective I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> asia-pacific has</font>

44
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,050
some issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we really wanted to</font>

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,120
highlight so we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

46
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:54,120
there was contents that was specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

47
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,060
the region so we had things ranging from

48
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,330
small and medium enterprise conference

49
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,390
for local businesses to things like the

50
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:06,810
organization of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the asia-pacific</font>

51
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,330
regional IGF alongside the main meetings

52
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,770

53
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,590
