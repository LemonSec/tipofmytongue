10
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:34,260
but let me start with some facts a year

11
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:37,170
ago I came to Asia and frankly I found

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:41,579
no other way to explain our presence in

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:44,789
asia but to apologize to age and i did i

14
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:48,899
said i made an apology because we were

15
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:51,719
almost non present here a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> later we</font>

16
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:55,050
have 14 people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the region we have a</font>

17
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,120

20
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,460

and most importantly we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have many people</font>

51
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,320
those who are in light blue are not in

52
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,780
the hub there in the region there across

this is the second year in our new

59
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:03,330
season when I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can I said</font>

60
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,239
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> till the ground get things</font>

61
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:09,180
ready and then hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can get to</font>

62
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">the point in this new season to see the</font>

63
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,780
fruit of our work however at this point

64
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:18,360
in our second year which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

65
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,280
halfway through my first tenure here or

66
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,170
my tenure with you for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three years</font>

67
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,040
that the board asked me to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

68
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:28,230
serve you I stopped a little bit and I

69
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:33,329
think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop and take stock</font>

70
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:35,790
a lot is going on a lot is on our minds

71
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:39,269
we're looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the work we've done and</font>

72
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:41,578
saying there's a lot on our plate but it

73
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:44,760
is an important time for us to step back

74
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:47,160
here in Singapore and think what is on

75
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,510
hand what is ahead of us and what we

76
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:55,500
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do to stay engaged and to be</font>

77
00:03:51,510 --> 00:04:00,450
successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the phase ahead so to take</font>

78
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:03,750
stock I asked my team to engage<font color="#CCCCCC"> with our</font>

79
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,910
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> and to really take a community</font>

80
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,910
view as to everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going on</font>

81
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,470
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can and to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decided</font>

82
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,680
we're going to create kind of a

83
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,810
community activity

84
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,350
map so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start understanding</font>

85
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:21,070
everything on hand that needs to be

86
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:23,020
addressed across the community and we

87
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:27,509
divided all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things into these</font>

88
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:31,359
three spheres the<font color="#CCCCCC"> core i can activities</font>

89
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:33,460
the emerging activities related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

92
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:42,070
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally our engagement on a global</font>

00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,070
level in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet Governance let me</font>

95
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,990
you it became clear that each of these

96
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,840
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas had many cross community</font>

97
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:55,120
activities let's look at them one at a

98
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,849
time let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with our core</font>

99
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,240
operations within our cooperations we

100
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:03,849
have five six major<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracks of work that</font>

101
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,970
engage all of us together again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

102
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:08,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">speaking about the many many areas of</font>

103
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,620
work and activities within our

00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,090

<font color="#E5E5E5">community-wide or cross community</font>

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:18,460
activities so in the global domains

107
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:21,039
division we found that there are five

108
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,659
key areas one of which is about to start

109
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,370
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I data privacy is still in</font>

00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:26,229
white but we're about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> launch that</font>

effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's becoming important</font>

112
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:30,370
that we globally understand that but let

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:36,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">me focus your attention for example on</font>

of our activities to ensure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i can</font>

discussing right now the board and

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,170
hopefully this week while we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

197
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:18,470
together the possibility of removing all

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:21,110
these advisory groups and instead

199
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,000
focusing all of our attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> now on the</font>

200
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,370
areas that need our attention through

201
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,140
public consultation so we will continue

202
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,120
discussing this with you through the

203
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,910
week and hopefully together<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll make</font>

204
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right decision so we focus everyone</font>

205
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:38,410
given also how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much is on our plate on</font>

206
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,410
the two key areas we need to focus on

207
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,560
now let me talk about these two areas

208
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,500
because today we are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

209
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,750
these two public consultations the first

210
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,080
one is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IANA stewardship</font>

211
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:57,690
transition this will be at ten-thirty so

212
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:01,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">immediately after the session we will</font>

213
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:03,690
launch the<font color="#E5E5E5"> global process of responding</font>

214
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:08,010
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> invitation of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> government</font>

215
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:10,800
to transition their stewardship to us to

216
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:13,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">us and all the people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">bring because it's not just too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can I</font>

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:19,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">can is just facilitating but it's truly</font>

219
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,270
to all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us with many of the</font>

220
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,189
communities represented here and those

221
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:26,189
that couldn't make it today we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

222
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:30,120
bring them into that global process now

223
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:33,230
i want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you now that this public</font>

224
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:36,690
consultation is about IANA transition

225
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:38,700
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have discussed now with the</font>

226
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,110
community with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaders with the</font>

227
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,250
board as well as with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US government</font>

228
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:47,670
that we should also discuss how we're

229
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:50,610
going to evolve<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICANN's accountability</font>

230
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:53,099
as an organization and let me separate

231
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,740
these two very clearly the IANA

232
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:59,910
functions are very specific functions

233
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:02,550
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> well defined and we do them</font>

234
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:05,040
together with other leaders in the

235
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:07,609
community and communities we need to

236
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,130
discuss how to manage these functions

237
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:13,050
specifically separate from that as I've

238
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:16,680
heard from many of you just in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

239
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:20,189
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> days who is going to keep the ICANN</font>

240
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,930
organization and check well today we

241
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,300
have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> called the affirmation of</font>

242
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,760
commitment but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the affirmation of</font>

243
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,339
commitments which is a very important

244
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,980
document central to who we are and how

245
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:36,090
we function is a document that today

246
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:39,600
through the historical record was signed

247
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:42,030
between I can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US government we</font>

248
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,520
as a community should look at that and

249
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:47,130
should look more broadly at icons

250
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:50,100
accountability and discuss how do we

251
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:53,430
evolve these mechanisms so that I can is

252
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,400
kept accountable and in check and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

253
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,729
discussion will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be today as well</font>

254
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:01,730
at 5pm so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I invite you all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to join us at</font>

255
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:07,640
5pm for that discussion separate from

256
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:12,170
the eye on a discussion I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

257
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:15,800
something on the IANA transition first

258
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:19,270
and foremost in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the presence of NTI is</font>

259
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:23,060
leadership here I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should all</font>

260
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:26,750
recognize without question<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

261
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:29,449
stewardship of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia the stewardship of</font>

262
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:32,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United States over the last 15</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

263
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:35,950
which has served the internet and the

264
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,950
world very well

265
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:52,080
and that recognition is important

266
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:55,020
because it actually starts with a story

267
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,110
that dr. Crocker said when he speaks

268
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:01,670
about them setting up their<font color="#E5E5E5"> first little</font>

269
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:06,080
network with he and<font color="#CCCCCC"> his friends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

270
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:10,740
giving this to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world keeping it open</font>

271
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:14,300
what a powerful gift to the world that

272
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:18,740
has continued with the progressively

273
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:21,300
less onerous stewardship and more

274
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:25,140
permissive stewardship to the community

275
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,699
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last 15</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years it is important</font>

276
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:30,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">for us to remember that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font>

277
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">government every few years said that the</font>

278
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,899
i kin community is right here now so

279
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,480
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change the mechanisms and</font>

280
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:39,330
instruments of stewardship up to the

point<font color="#E5E5E5"> last friday where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA came to the</font>

282
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:47,760
conclusion that we are ready and this is

283
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:50,370
a testament of our work it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> triumph</font>

284
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,520
of the multi-stakeholder model and it's

285
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,350
a testament<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the United States</font>

286
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,720
fulfilled its commitment which they made

00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,910
on the first day I can was born that

432
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:06,950

<font color="#E5E5E5">activities right now are all mutually</font>

and critically important to our success

435
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,400
it is very hard to pick and choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

ones to stop where we could we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font>

we focus and get this job done finally I

started and it started with our first

very important stop along the way but

466
00:22:54,810 --> 00:23:00,540
the reason I show us this is to remind

to this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when the US government</font>

decides it is time to trust us that's

until today when reporters call me and

00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:23,370
they say oh it was because of this event

or that event that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happened I tell</font>

our words it's how we start today after

491

this session to engage<font color="#CCCCCC"> with each other</font>

492
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:19,350
and to build processes with private

sector governments and civil society all

494
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:26,550
of us together building stewardship to

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,590
take the internet to the next stage so

496
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:31,050
let's not miss this opportunity let's

497
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:35,370
not miss this opportunity and let's do

500
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,780
I believe are good principles and these

501
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,960
are important for us to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mind as</font>

502
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,990
we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next session number one</font>

503
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,900
whatever we do

504
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:53,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">place the US stewardship must be rooted</font>

505
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,850
in the multi-stakeholder model we cannot

506
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:57,850
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to them with a transition plan</font>

507
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:59,770
that hands our important work to a

508
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:02,409
government a group of governments and

509
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:08,260
intergovernmental organization no it

510
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:11,740
will not work number two the work the

511
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:15,010
transition model we design must attend

512
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:17,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the needs of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the global community not</font>

513
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,570
any one part of the community not any

514
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,510
part of the world all the global

515
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:25,330
community we must serve everyone with

516
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:27,129
distinction and equally that's the

517
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:29,409
second condition the US government put

518
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:32,140
the third condition the US government

519
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:34,690
put that nothing we will come back with

520
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:38,290
will jeopardize the openness of the

521
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:40,540
Internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet we want the</font>

522
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,840
internet Crocker<font color="#E5E5E5"> and his friends design</font>

523
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:45,940
the same principles that they used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

524
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,309
design the technical architecture of

<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be used for designing</font>

526
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:54,550
the governance architecture of the

527
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:56,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet openness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very key and then</font>

528
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:58,629
lastly the US government made it very

529
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:01,179
clear in this fourth principle that

530
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:04,300
nothing we do should jeopardize the

531
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:06,940
security stability and resiliency of the

532
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:10,899

533
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:13,570
none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us want to see a nanosecond of</font>

interruption<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that system it drives</font>

the world it's a global<font color="#E5E5E5"> force for human</font>
