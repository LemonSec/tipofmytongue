and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information and commitment so</font>

50

there's a kind of a triple<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there</font>

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:29,640
the program and there will be

00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:31,110
anticipated problems or oddball cases or

55
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,079
loose ends that have to be dealt with

56
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,580
and so there'll be a certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of</font>

historic change withdrawal aware but

82
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,919
that historic change<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't just as I</font>

83
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:59,320
was suggesting earlier due to the board

84
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:02,859
it really was a very broad community

85
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,979
action and so let me ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you give</font>

86
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:09,159
yourselves a hand for the enormous

87
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:11,520
activity and energy and success<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

88

89
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:28,389
well we're doing great<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we also</font>

90
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:32,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a inescapable and abiding</font>

00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:34,629

92
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:37,049

accountability<font color="#E5E5E5"> and transparency</font>

94
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:43,058
extremely seriously and so in that day I

95
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:46,179
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to commit a word of the second</font>

00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:13,779
understand what the impact would be so

104
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:18,188
that when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> say yes if I fully expect</font>

105
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:20,079
we will do either wholly or in the main

00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:23,409
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will know exactly what we have said</font>

yes to and exactly how to proceed with

108
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:28,269
the implementation so we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:31,479
process of formulating a response to the

teams report and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll say more about</font>

111
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:36,998
this in a session on Wednesday morning

112
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:40,360
which I invite you all<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to but I</font>

113
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:42,789

divide yourselves in two and half of

go to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one in the other later</font>

119
00:06:55,769 --> 00:07:01,229
this afternoon ova a session that is

120
00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:03,179
focused on the slightly broader topic of

121
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:05,789
the affirmation of commitments in

122
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:08,909
general and which is all the more

123
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:12,139
important in the context that has now

124
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:16,769
been set with the historic<font color="#E5E5E5"> announcement</font>
