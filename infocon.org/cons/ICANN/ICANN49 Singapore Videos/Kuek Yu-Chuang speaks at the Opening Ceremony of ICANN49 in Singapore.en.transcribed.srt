the inclusive nature that we do things

189
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:16,680
ago on the eve of putting the first note

190
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:19,939
on the ARPANET at UCLA where we happened

191
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:24,979
to be and we had been for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few months</font>

192
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:28,550
laying out the basic sketch

193
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:31,200
architectures too broad a word<font color="#E5E5E5"> too too</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">too strong in a way but the sort of the</font>

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the image of what we expected and one of</font>

197

minds was all that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be accomplished</font>

198
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,600
and how little<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were going to be able</font>

199
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:48,240
to specify it in detail and so the most

200
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,450
important thing was to lay the

201
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,770
foundation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for an open system that would</font>

202
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:57,420
allow openness in several dimensions

00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:00,480
openness from a technical perspective to

204
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:03,240
build new things on top of the framework

205
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're designing and openness to</font>

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,940
permit people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from every quarter of the</font>

207
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:11,850
world to enter and participate so that

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,670
it was not a fully specified closed

209
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:17,880
system handed down from one group to

210
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:21,120
another and the the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of initiatives</font>

211
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:25,500
that you've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen are the the</font>

embodiment of what we had hoped for it

213
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:31,110
is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most fulfilling</font>

experiences to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the long</font>

00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,660
are a handful of us in the room to to

217
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:43,620
these kinds of initiatives many years
