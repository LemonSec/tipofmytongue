the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to speak with us Steve let's</font>

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,559
start with you this meeting I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> 49</font>

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,809
started on the heels of the historic

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,910
NTID announcement about the transfer of

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,460
stewardship of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye and IANA</font>

functions what has come at you in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,980
course of the meeting on that issue it

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,869
was a stark announcement for sure and it

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,320
has attracted enormous amount of

11
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:31,380
attention one of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia</font>

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,910
was very careful to do was to say they

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:39,239
wanted community input as a consequence

14
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,860
some of the people seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be uneasy if</font>

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,328
they wanted more structure we know of

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">course that if they said this is the way</font>

17
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,989
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it a different set of</font>

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,110
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would say hey why are you telling</font>

19
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,930
us how I'm doing so there's been a

20
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:56,670
spectrum of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wide range of responses</font>

21
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,989
mostly positive but ranging over from we

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,910
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have quite understand what the way</font>

23
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,218
forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to a number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of very specific</font>

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,048
suggestions about how to proceed for

25
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,649
this is the healthy part of the process

26
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:10,170
and over the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> period of time we're</font>

27
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:13,909
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of suggestions and</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cole s and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll sort them out and</font>

29
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:19,709
try to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with a useful set of ways</font>

30
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,199
forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fadi this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to involve</font>

other members of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet community</font>

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,729
what we call the I stars how do you

33
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:32,159
include them in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> process it's</font>

34
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:34,529
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> underline that the process</font>

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,169
must include not just the other

36
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:39,270
technical communities but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even broader</font>

37
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:41,429
than that any community that wants to

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,149
have a say in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this process this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

open all inclusive global process to

40
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:51,749
find these<font color="#E5E5E5"> mechanisms how will involve</font>

41
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:54,989
is by running consultations and public

42
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:57,809
forums not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only in I can meetings over</font>

43
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:59,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next 18 months but hopefully also</font>

44
00:01:57,809 --> 00:02:02,000
the plan is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

45
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:04,250
is in the meetings of our other

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,139
organizations in the technical space the

47
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:13,849
IETF the regional internet registries

48
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:16,130
the ccTLD regional organizations we will

49
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:19,429
hold a public consultation and Netanyahu

50
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:23,900
in the upcoming meeting in Brazil at the

51
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:26,330
IGF at our ccTLD forms around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

52
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:30,380
so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to reach as many people</font>

53
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:33,640
as possible in public consultations to

54
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:36,380
be also<font color="#E5E5E5"> complemented by online</font>

55
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">consultations where we will have space</font>

56
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,819
on the web from<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to provide input</font>

57
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,750
so that from the beginning and

58
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:46,899
throughout this process is open

59
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:49,540
transparent and will yield the outcomes

community reaction bin was weak well

64
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,880
clearly the community has been waiting

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:08,358
for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 15 years clearly this is</font>

not a surprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the US government has modulated its</font>

and down guided down and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just a</font>

00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,849
of the future let me ask you

150
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,349
specifically about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> apac region it</font>

151
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:31,219
was about a year ago when you actually

152
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:33,319
apologized to the region for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lack of</font>

153
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:37,099
more inclusion in the multi-stakeholder

154
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:39,770
process what's your feeling now today we

155
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:42,199
have come a long way a year ago when i

156
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:45,409
came to asia for the first time our

157

160
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,620
very very limited activity

161
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,780

half the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> users of the world</font>

163
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:03,510

164
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,480
apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the community but more</font>
