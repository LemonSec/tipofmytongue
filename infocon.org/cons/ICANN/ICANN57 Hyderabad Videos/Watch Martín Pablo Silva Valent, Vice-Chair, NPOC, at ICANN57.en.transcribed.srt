00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,640
concerned with we understand the

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you that there are more</font>

54
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:23,170
interesting in fighting the name fraud

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,059
that happens inside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NGO world</font>

56
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,329
something that is quite usual when it

57
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:31,690
comes to fundings especially the ones

58
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:34,390
that are related to to human rescue or

59
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,190
human disasters usually after an

60
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,319
earthquake or something like that a lot

<font color="#CCCCCC">moments of funding and others are going</font>

64
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,280
to tell you that the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

65
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,830
private sector tries to steal their

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,390
names because they have trademarks so

67
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,519
they use their try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use earth tremors</font>

68
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:55,750
and the deep pockets in order to take

69
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,819
out usually acronyms from NGOs and all

70
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,030
those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say no this is their</font>

71
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:02,410
interest is to have a secure domain name

72
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,420
space so that they don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to depend</font>

73
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">on third parties that it can be like</font>

74
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,530
social network that usually is very good

75
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,790
to do outreach<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to and to communicate</font>

76
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:14,230
but it doesn't guarantee the the NGO to

77
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,298
to actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have control of the content</font>

78
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,390
that it shares he produced the members

79
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:21,100
at it it has so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think its members</font>

80
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,779
going to tell you probably a different

81
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,600
aspect that they're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside</font>

82
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:29,230
the gene and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can tell you mine for</font>

83
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,120
instance I am very<font color="#E5E5E5"> active right now in</font>

84
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,440
the one of the working group since i Jes

85
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,230
oh it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cashier it's a cross-community</font>

86
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,850
working group so it goes beyond the<font color="#CCCCCC"> non</font>

87
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,828
commercial<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspects and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

88
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,980
all sectors and that's the right

89
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:47,079
protection mechanism and we're basically

90
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:49,390
reviewing how I can give stools today to

91
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:51,930
the users<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect their in their</font>

92
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,828
rights to enforce the rights and

93
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,019
especially when there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some sort of</font>

94
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:57,910
conflict and you usually have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

95
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:01,120
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know hey I have a better right to</font>

96
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:05,230
that name then you have or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you're</font>

97
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,930
trying to scam me or we have runs on my

98
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,760
name things like that and how do you see

99
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,470
that develop over the next few few

100
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,929
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and years where do you think that</font>

101
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:16,390
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> going or where would you like to</font>

102
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,418
see it go I second from a non commercial

103
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:22,740
perspective I of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm skeptical of</font>

104
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:25,740
how trademark issues are you are too

105
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,259
inside the daikon space I'm a strong

106
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">advocate that domain name issues are not</font>

107
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,880
trademark issues it's much broader and

108
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,210
DNS is there for non-commercial uses as

109
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,530
well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to leave you</font>

110
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,419
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> one thing that I would like the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">join that with is to have a strong</font>

113
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,580
mechanism that allows it doesn't

marginalize<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-commercial</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> users and</font>

115
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,979
NGOs that that understands that tree

116
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:55,500
marks of course are important i'm not

117
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:57,060
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should protect them but</font>

left one of your previous answer

121
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,460
questions unanswered that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that what</font>

122
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,380
do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the yen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and post gianna</font>

123
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,780
transition enjoy inside the M POC and

124
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,460
the new commercial community and I

125
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically think that the biggest</font>

126
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:19,739
challenge is the accountability and

127
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:22,789
transparency that allow us to say that

128
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:26,990
we are legitimacy they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> legitimate</font>

129
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:29,820
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> truly are open that we are truly</font>

130
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:33,330
created in space that allow us to say we

131
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,250
represent or we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can represent in the</font>

132
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,370
future we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are developing the tools to</font>

133
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,240
represent civil society as a whole

134
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,180
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one of the</font>

135
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,820
weakest point right now the inside I can

136
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,919
everyone is reviewing each person are

137
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,389
you really representing this can we read

138
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,859
to ask you to represent<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interest of</font>

space enough not because we are going to

141
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,679
represent but because we're building the

142
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,569
space so that people can<font color="#E5E5E5"> come and</font>
