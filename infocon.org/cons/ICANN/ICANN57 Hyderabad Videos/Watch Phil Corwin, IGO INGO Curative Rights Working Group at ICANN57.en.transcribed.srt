under a GN s<font color="#CCCCCC"> o charter that was adopted</font>

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:39,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">in June 2014 we started our work</font>

September of that year and we're charged

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,640
registrations and we looked at what the

37
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:45,229
problems are that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas were having and</font>

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:51,090
we had to pause at one point and secure

39
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:54,960
some funding and finding a an expert on

40
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,960
international law because the consensus

42
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,259
was a key issue to<font color="#CCCCCC"> determine our output</font>

43
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,259
and we had no expertise among members<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,419
the working group in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we secured</font>

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,259
an expert independent report to guide us

believe is a near final draft to those
