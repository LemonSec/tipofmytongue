together in an open and transparent way

82
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:28,820
and for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need a diverse</font>

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:03,560
no time to rest it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">forward I've been here now a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

94
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,090
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are more discussions we</font>

95
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,820
have to engage in especially with camp

96
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:13,820
state accountability one way is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

97
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:16,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have clearer rules</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roles sorry</font>

100
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:24,349
to define those rules because something

101
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,840
I realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> during also the last couple</font>

00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:29,690
of weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the transition is outside</font>

103
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,940
his room all solved our communities many

104
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:35,660
people don't understand how internet

105
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,370
actually works maybe don't have to but

106
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,640
it was apparent that many people

107
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:43,280
understand the mechanics of this you of

108
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,289
course know this you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

109
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,929
internet is like machine where

110
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations people come together work</font>

111
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,510
independently from one side under a

112
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:55,100
voluntarily system that's unique it's a

113
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:59,030
system that's never been invented like

114
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,770
that before you also know that the I can

115
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,080
roll is a part of that ecosystem

116
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,640
together for resistance with our friends

117
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,930

00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,030
the roll back for the unique identifiers

120
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,030
when I try to describe I can for

121
