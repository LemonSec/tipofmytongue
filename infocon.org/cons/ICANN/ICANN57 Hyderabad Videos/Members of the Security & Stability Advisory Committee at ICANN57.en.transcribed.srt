00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,040
thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> joining me gentlemen thank</font>

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,079
you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you Patrick I understood esic</font>

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,580
recently came out with<font color="#E5E5E5"> sac 84 can you</font>

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,788
briefly explain what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and what it</font>

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">means sure we in a sec we evaluated the</font>

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,699
EPS RP guidelines and we concluded that

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,710
three for us very important principles

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,810
were missing can you elaborate what

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,790
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> three principles are there there</font>

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,379
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three principles or sort of tied</font>

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,210
together so they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> related there are</font>

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,219
some relations between them and there

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,800
are conservatism which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

17
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">should always calculate the risk based</font>

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,899
on like in a conservative manner the

19
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,280
second one inclusion has to do with the

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,800
fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you should not include</font>

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,890
anything unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,169
is sort of the risk is manageable which

23
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,270
is tied to the conservatism and this

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">last one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has to do with stability which</font>

25
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,289
is that after<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have added something</font>

26
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,530
you cannot remove it so all of those

27
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,450
together are really really important for

28
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,000
security and stability reasons and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

29
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,369
add on top of that it's also important

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,040
for stability reasons to not only think

31
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,140
about the change but the rate of changes

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,119
happens how widely these principles

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,189
accepted these are very generic

34
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,960
principles that are that originated in

35
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering task force many</font>

36
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,798
many years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and there are principles</font>

37
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,439
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use whenever you do changes to</font>

38
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,400
protocols or processes Jim why are they

39
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">so important so SX responsibility first</font>

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,329
and foremost is to the security

41
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,908
stability and resiliency of the

42
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet's identify our systems and in</font>

43
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,700
this case specifically the DNS so

44
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:47,460
technical feasibility these three

45
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,100
principles were first created in the ITF

46
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,070
and we believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are essential</font>

47
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,720
to any risk calculation as far as the

48
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,520
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> and stability and resiliency</font>

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,500
the DNS is<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerns what kind of advice</font>

50
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,130
is sac 84 providing in relation to these

51
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,689
principles so our message is a repeat of

52
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,630
a message that we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying for a</font>

53
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,139
while we think it's essential<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these</font>

54
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,620
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> principles</font>

55
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:13,329
be a conscious reflection of any change

56
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,330
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the root zone at the time of the</font>

57
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:18,940
evaluation part of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this means is</font>

58
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:22,000
that any efforts to assert you know

59
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:24,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">government or national sovereignty for a</font>

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,060
shared resource really does fall short

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,049
of technical feasibility well thanks so

62
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,640
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> for both of your time and I hope</font>

63
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,790
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a great rest your meeting are</font>

64
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,790
you
