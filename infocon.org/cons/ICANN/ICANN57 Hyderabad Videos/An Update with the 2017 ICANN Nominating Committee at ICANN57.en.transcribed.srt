there specific changes for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> non calm</font>

36
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,039
now that the public<font color="#CCCCCC"> technica public</font>

37
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,649
technical identifies the PTI is formed

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,329
yes this is a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> of great change for</font>

39
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,899
the non calm and for the whole community

40
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,908
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are now post-transition so as</font>

41
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,610
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just mentioned the PTI the public</font>

42
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,880
technical identifies is a new group that

43
00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:00,990
will take<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the IANA functions once</font>

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,539
it's fully incorporated and we the

45
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,270
noncom are tasked with selecting to that

46
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,360
board as well it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> five person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> board</font>

47
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,730
we are tasked with selecting two seats

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,849
to that five-person board

49
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,000
and we will start doing that this year

50
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:20,310
with one seat having a two-year term and

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,950
one seat having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> three-year term so</font>

52
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,560
that we build in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rotation that we</font>

53
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,319
need for that board as well so the

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,599
noncom has just seen its workload

55
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:34,170
increase and it's also going into

56
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,899
uncharted territory but it's a natural

57
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,030
and logical extension to the very

58
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,670
important work<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the noncom does for</font>

59
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,799
the community so<font color="#CCCCCC"> he'd what are the other</font>

60
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,798
leadership positions and why do they

61
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:48,030
offer offer opportunities for people to

62
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">get involved it's a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good question</font>

63
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,660
because apart from the very important

64
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,879
work of selecting appointees to the

65
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,430
board the noncom has this responsibility

66
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,179
of actually filling certain positions in

67
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,109
three other organizations supporting

68
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">organization advisory organizations</font>

69
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:05,280
within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> icon structure so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

70
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:06,599
is the gns oh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll come back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,299
these in a second then there's the a

72
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,429
lack and then there's the CC NSO now the

73
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:16,200
gns<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically makes policy with</font>

74
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:18,060
respect to all generic gTLDs and imagine

75
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,679
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that you drop in somebody into</font>

76
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:24,500
that this shows that it allows the I can

77
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,299
structure to function without

78
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,819
crystallization or gaming of groups to

79
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:30,510
create monopolies they have their own

80
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,518
processes by which they elect them

81
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,450
bringing representatives of course they

82
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,819
have some of them have diversity

83
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,649
requirements but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this enables the NAM</font>

84
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:41,149
come to a point individuals who will

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring new ideas and views to the</font>

87
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,950
instance also within the a lack there

88
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,139
are various<font color="#CCCCCC"> different regions in which</font>

89
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,959

90
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,609
dropping someone into those you see it

91
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,739
gives the enablement to the community at

92
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,120
large<font color="#CCCCCC"> to apply if they have the criteria</font>

93
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,010
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to come directly into these</font>

94
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,040
positions not necessarily coming up from

95
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,870
bottom up this allows a nice mix between

96
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,400
the policy processes of those who are

97
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of the sort of the hardened</font>

98
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,489
community as it were in some sense or

99
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,650
those who are coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up through the</font>

100
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,359
organic process versus those who can be

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,010
dropped into this and said well you know

102
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:16,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a complete different view let's</font>

103
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,899
actually see where this ends up at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

104
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,358
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is the CC NSO the advantage of</font>

105
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,310
being appointed to a slot within the CC

106
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,960
NSO is that you wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to get</font>

107
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to be part of</font>

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,299
some national ccTLD structure and

109
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,580
dropping someone into that actually is

110
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,490
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> beneficial both to the two giving</font>

111
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,390
more new views as it were to the ccTLD

112
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,830
structure so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's very</font>

113
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,479
important appointments it's an

114
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,490
opportunity for folks for who have the

115
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,840
capability and understanding they don't

116

provide some more substance in different

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,510
views to all these organizations sounds

121
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:57,240
like you're saying it's a chance to to
