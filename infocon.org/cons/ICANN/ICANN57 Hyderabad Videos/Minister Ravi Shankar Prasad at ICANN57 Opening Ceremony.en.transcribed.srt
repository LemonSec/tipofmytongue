and we want to replicate it more and

00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">more</font>

159
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:50,870

local and local means local<font color="#E5E5E5"> languages</font>

166
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,420
we have done a lot of domain names about

seven indian languages we want to

169
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,220
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to appeal to the icon</font>

community that please make focused

initiative to make local languages

172
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:24,860
available more for Internet users to

173
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,529
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> accessible that I think in the</font>

174

need of the are too quick issues and I

175
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:35,240
conclude obviously internet needs to be

176
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:37,329
safe for the use of all and the tragedy

177

<font color="#E5E5E5">of our times ladies and gentlemen is</font>

178
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,310
that few people are abusing this

ICT we very strongly feel that the

184
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:06,589
government as an important stakeholder

185
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,750
needs to have a proper role in ensuring

186
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:10,490
security for the country including for

<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet for the use of all and</font>

188
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,830
therefore the icon community needs to

work for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security establishment to</font>
