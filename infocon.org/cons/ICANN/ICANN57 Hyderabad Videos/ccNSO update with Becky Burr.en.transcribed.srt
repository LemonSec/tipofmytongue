within the community not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only is the</font>

CCMS a counselor but the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,439
ecosystem<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you tell us a bit about</font>

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,650
it so my history with i Ken goes back to

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,990
the very beginning I was at NTIA in 1998

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,800
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can was created and actually</font>

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,989
signed the letter recognizing I can so

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,569
in that time I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the GAC</font>

15
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:43,260
for a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I worked in the</font>

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:48,030
registry community I went on to the CC

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,519
NSO as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> nom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> com appointee and I've</font>

18
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,899
always really enjoyed working with the

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,020
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this in Santa so they're very</font>

20
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:59,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">focused on what they need to be doing</font>

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:03,530
and not working on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font>

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:06,299
excessive stuff there really a great

23
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,939
interesting and diverse group and then

24
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:12,180
in 2012 when i moved to new star i

25
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:16,500
actually got to rejoin the council as

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,630
the as a representative from dot us I've

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,420
often heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard you refer to the CC</font>

28
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,899
NSO is the same as group why is that

29
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:27,150
well I think it's because they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,420
focused on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're doing there's</font>

31
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,479
not a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can policy development</font>

32
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,659
that is relevant to them because

33
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:41,939
generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> CeCe's run in accordance with</font>

34
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:45,119
national law so so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

35
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,398
are limited issues that they have to

36
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,140
worry about and but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really focus on</font>

37
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,960
those and those are complicated issues

38
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,439
and also there's a huge amount of

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:59,360
information sharing and support for the

40
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:03,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the country code top-level domains that</font>

41
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,970
the group works on and finally it's just

42
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,430
an enormously diverse and interesting

43
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,780
human beings what have been some of your

44
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,550
highlights from your time working both

45
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,060
within the i kin community and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CCN</font>

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:18,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">SL well i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say in the CC NSO the</font>

47
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,300
work that we did on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that resulted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

48
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:26,670
framework of interpretation for country

code<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds has been the most rewarding we</font>

50
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:33,780
spent six years developing the framework

51
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:37,549
of interpretation first reviewing all of

52
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:40,440
the delegations and and revocation

process had worked in what was good

55
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:49,770
about it and what was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not so good about</font>

56
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:52,079
it and then working you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for several</font>

57
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:55,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">years to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> develop the framework and to</font>

58
00:02:52,080 --> 00:03:01,680
get agreement across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that the RFC 1591 interpretations were</font>

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,850
that has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge that was a huge</font>

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,238
accomplishment that we worked on

63
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:15,630
together for a long time I mean you know

from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> icam perspective the transition</font>

65
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:22,019
that's just been completed is something

66
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:23,640
that you know we anticipated in 1998

67
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,130
would take a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years it took</font>

68
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,238
quite a bit longer than that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

69
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,470
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting when it occurred so it's</font>

70
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,570
minor saying this is going to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

group of human beings there's a huge

78
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:57,510
amount we can learn from each other<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

79
