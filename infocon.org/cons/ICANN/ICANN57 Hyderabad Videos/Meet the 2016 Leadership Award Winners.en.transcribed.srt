1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,690
the IANA stewardship transition was an

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,830
amazing accomplishment and one that

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,719
wouldn't have occurred without the

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,940
efforts of this year's leadership awards

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,950
winners we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk with those</font>

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,300
winners to find out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was involved by</font>

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,340
their respective members of the

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,320
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what the award meant to</font>

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,300
them I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the biggest challenge for</font>

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,960
the names community is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're a very</font>

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,849
diverse and broad community so the

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenges that we faced were bringing</font>

13
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:34,960
those diversity of views together in a

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,550
in a tight<font color="#E5E5E5"> time frame and yet making</font>

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,500
sure everyone's point of view could be

16
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,809
heard my group was the technique is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

17
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">technical community known as the ITF</font>

18
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:46,350
internet Engineering Task Force I was

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,390
the co-chair of the working group and

20
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,970
actually I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> receiving their word but</font>

21
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,700
really it's the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> that did all</font>

22
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:57,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">the work I don't think it was a</font>

23
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,380
difficult it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation that</font>

24
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,820
implied very hard work for the community

25
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:05,409
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of volunteers worked tirelessly</font>

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,960
throughout many hours many meetings

27
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:10,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">face-to-face meetings calls etc to make</font>

28
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,809
this happen so it was at some point

29
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:16,359
difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach compromise but then</font>

30
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">again the diversity within our community</font>

31
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:22,270
it's it's own strength so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that led us to</font>

32
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,119
actually finding these compromises and

33
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,609
being able to make this transition

34
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,950
happen what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique about the number</font>

35
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:33,309
resources component of the proposal was

36
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:36,219
that we had five regional processes so

37
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,829
we went through on all of the five

38
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:41,199
regions to develop each of the proposals

39
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:44,199
and once we went through this regional

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,539
processes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually consolidated this</font>

41
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,369
into a single global proposal so there

42
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:51,579
are actually two steps involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

43
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:54,700
and so there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of effort trying</font>

44
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:57,369
to first develop the process on the

45
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,139
proposal and provisional basis and

46
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:03,069
trying to see what was the difference

47
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:05,798
between on regional proposal so that was

48
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:08,319
something that we actually on what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

49
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,959
little bit challenging for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> icg that</font>

50
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,980
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vice chair of we merge the</font>

51
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,170
proposals that were created<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

52
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,840
community different communities and the

53
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardest part was to dis use in enough</font>

54
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,489
time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not too much on finding where</font>

55
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">the gaps were where the overlaps were</font>

56
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:27,720
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> encourage the communities to resolve</font>

57
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,819
those issues you have to remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

58
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,650
icon community is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> diverse we have</font>

59
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,379
government representatives we have the

60
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,569
academic sector we have civil society we

61
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:38,459
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry and representatives from</font>

62
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:40,410
those groups come from all<font color="#CCCCCC"> around the</font>

63
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,629
world so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a diversity in it with</font>

64
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,019
interest we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a diversity diversity</font>

65
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:48,599
of you length languages and also of

66
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,129
cultural approaches to things and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

67
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite a challenge to bring this diverse</font>

68
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:55,620
group together it was more than 200

69
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,839
people strong and come to consensus so I

70
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,910
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we navigated this</font>

71
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,609
quite nicely because the group was very

72
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,470
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this happen and I think</font>

73
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:06,420
this has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> unprecedented and the</font>

74
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,180
group the whole community is<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming out</font>

75
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,280
of this much stronger actually our work

76
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,099
was probably the simplest part of all

77
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,129
this post this transition thing because

78
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:19,470
our relationship was will define an

79
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:23,760
accountability on our side and all those

80
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:27,419
a matrix of the SLA<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in place</font>

81
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,819
already so roughly speaking it was a

82
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:31,940
simpler but at the same time was

83
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,918
important because it needs to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

84
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:38,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">for four so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the whole transition</font>

85
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:40,019
Adam yeah there were thousands of hours

86
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,540
there were many many many phone calls

87
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,060
there were people working all night long

88
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,510
it because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time some differences</font>

89
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:52,620
so yes enormous amount of time spent

90
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:54,630
many hours weekends evenings and and and

91
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,910
work in lots of ways it's not just just

92
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,280
time it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to bring together</font>

93
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">people's diverse viewpoints make sure</font>

94
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,049
they're properly heard and brought

95
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,010
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an effective way a lot of</font>

96
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,280
time I worry about a lot of people

97
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:11,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">indeed and this recognition is only a</font>

98
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,349
recognition to the community<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself you</font>

99
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,660
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're only the bus drivers Antipas</font>

100
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:17,969
can only go as fast as the parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

101
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,159
bus itself allows him and it can only

102
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">reach its destiny by following</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

103
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,210
directions from those that are that he's

104
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,950
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive so we were just the</font>

105
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,469
bus drivers this is a recognition

106
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,500
and a wide for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole community with</font>

107
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,320
we'd had calls morning evening<font color="#CCCCCC"> nighttime</font>

108
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,030
and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the commitment it was</font>

109
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">just outstanding we even had caused on</font>

110
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:42,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">Thanksgiving I think the leadership</font>

111
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:45,630
award and the transition<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm really is</font>

112
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:49,860
people say is oh it's the success of the

113
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:53,670
multi-stakeholder community and to put

114
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">it in more simple word I knew</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

115
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,870
part that the bottom-up open inclusive

116
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,700
process work for each of individual

117
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,370
communities but this is really the first

118
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,320
time that we coordinated between the

119
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,660
three operational communities we

120
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a concrete form that</font>

121
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,670
arm and we actually proved that

122
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,400
ourselves that it works so I think this

123
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:18,120
really means a lot I think the technical

124
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,719
people need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our I've been the guys</font>

125
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:25,230
who develop the internet right and so I

126
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,630
think we're we're also leading you know

127
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,700
making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the rest of the</font>

128
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,440
industry understands how the internet

129
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,900
works and I think that's an important

130
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,630
our leadership is actually very involved

131
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">in making sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that sometimes people</font>

132
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,900
think that the internet works one<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

133
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,640
but actually works another way and I

134
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part of our role to</font>

135
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,080
help the community to understand and

136
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,510
make it better right and make it for

137
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,460
everyone and so with that I'm honored<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

138
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,819
announce the winners for this year's
