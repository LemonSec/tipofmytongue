what was happening with domain names

that we were selling them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our</font>

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,090
the heist and non-commercial user side

of the house could you talk us through

38
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:36,780
represent<font color="#E5E5E5"> really large spectrum of</font>

00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:40,139
organization and individuals and so and

40
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,680
we we were format since the inception of

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,040
about human rights freedom of expression

43
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:54,149
privacy and so on to<font color="#E5E5E5"> defend dericious</font>

torrent and the end users and 2 to be

48
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:09,280
and in 2009

49
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:10,600
I I was appointed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the general counsel</font>

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,960
at that time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was kind of</font>

51
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:16,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting experience for me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

52
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,430
discover how how policy is made with an

53
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,970
icon and all the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> processes and</font>

54
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:24,520
so on so given the new role of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gns</font>

55
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,260
or post<font color="#CCCCCC"> iono transition what do each of</font>

you hope to contribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gso</font>

57
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">council</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like Rafiq first I think it's</font>

58
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,760
quite tricky because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> steel and</font>

59
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,250
chartered and no in space for everyone

60
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,079
we don't know what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can expect and</font>

61
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">also we have to deal with different</font>

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,620
interest with indigenous oh that's not

63
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:47,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">new but within the new role we were made</font>

64
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,870
some some new stuff that's pop up and we

65
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,540
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out so it's quite good</font>

66
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,670
the challenge for for those who get

67
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:58,150
involved because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think for the last</font>

68
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:01,059
year's maybe there is no enough kind of

69
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,100
hot topics within the genus or concern

70
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:07,660
now it's I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will become much</font>

71
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:09,489
more interesting but it's I think it's

72
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:13,060
important because the transition is

73
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:14,680
still going on so what happens is just

74
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,410
one step and still we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to figure out</font>

75
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's what we have to do and to</font>

76
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,750
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the impact of the</font>

77
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:26,140
different groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> so even for us as the</font>

78
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:28,269
non-commercial stakeholder group<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it</font>

79
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,720
can be challenging because we are not

80
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:35,290
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> where resource group within</font>

81
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:39,010
icon and most of us really are here as a

82
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,150
volunteer so it's it's it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

83
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,870
fun

84
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,879
I mean the Judicial Council coordinates

85
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,239
the policy-making but doesn't actually

86
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:52,030
make the policy the policies are made

87
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,849
within the working groups and it's the

88
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:58,629
role of the genus<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Council to going to</font>

89
00:03:54,849 --> 00:04:00,970
manage all that manage that process you

90
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:02,560
know post iono transition<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean as</font>

91
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">rapid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mention of the ANA transition</font>

92
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,049
isn't completely garments it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

93
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:10,090
evolving that role it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

94
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:12,099
change dramatically I think you're going

95
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see an evolution you're going to see</font>

96
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:19,089
an emphasis on a focus maybe on certain

97
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:21,940
parts of ICANN more now than in the past

98
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:23,799
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean ultimately the wheels still</font>

99
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,289
need to keep rolling things still need

100
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,510
to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening nothing really should</font>

101
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:31,300
change ultimately if the IANA transition

102
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:35,440
is successful nobody notices and nobody

103
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,630
cares so I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea Gina so</font>

104
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">council the moment is going to facing a</font>

105
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:43,090
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of interesting challenges because</font>

106
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,669
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of interest as around</font>

107
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,020
certain topics where I'll be enough

108
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:48,400
there is a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of convergence of views</font>

109
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,448
here but with your things around like

110
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,310
say content regulation some pick up some

111
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:56,409
interest groups trying to push the

112
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,229
boundaries of what is with a nikon

113
00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:01,210
dreamers and trying to to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can to</font>

114
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:03,969
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved and things that I'm</font>

115
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,138
really outside of a shadow scope so I

116
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,539
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

117
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:09,099
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenges so you've both</font>

118
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:11,560
alluded to<font color="#E5E5E5"> being quite busy week ahead</font>

119
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:14,139
what do you see is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key topics</font>

120
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,389
for a genius<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so this week I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font>

121
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:17,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the it's a key topics it's it's always</font>

122
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:20,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">like kind of trying to choose your</font>

123
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">favourite child or something there's a</font>

124
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,400
few there's a number of thing of quite

125
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,250
bigger issues at the moment I mean

126
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got who is related</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff which is</font>

127
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">always a favourite topic the RDS PDP has</font>

128
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,799
been going on there for<font color="#E5E5E5"> several months</font>

129
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,199
and and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end is nowhere near</font>

130
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">in size then there's the who the who is</font>

131
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,650
review team is meant to be kicking off

132
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,049
now as well

133
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:47,888
that again with who is you've also got

134
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:50,199
proxy privacy and a bunch of other

135
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:53,699
little work<font color="#E5E5E5"> ships they'll enter interact</font>

136
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,870
with each other so it's always

137
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:59,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to see what you know what</font>

138
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:01,180
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with at the council level</font>

139
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:06,820
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I'm not going to reserve</font>

140
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:08,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">judgment well I do think for for this</font>

141
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,169
meeting we are going to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> more time</font>

142
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:14,590
discussing policy issues which was not

143
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:20,130
really the case before because all the

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,650
right protection you can use and so it's

148

<font color="#E5E5E5">really all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this heavy and a policy</font>

149
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:37,330
process that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they should take more time</font>

150
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:40,389
of those one android here we spent i

153
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:50,080

00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,609
session which may be overlap but they

157
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,800
will take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different standpoint about</font>

158
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:03,370
the content regulation and what they

159
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,580
