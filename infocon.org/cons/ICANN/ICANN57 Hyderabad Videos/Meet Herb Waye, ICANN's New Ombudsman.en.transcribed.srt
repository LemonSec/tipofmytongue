on developing relationships in the

some your<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term goals for the office</font>

00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,290
well I want the office to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be viewed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

46
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,869
much more than just an accountability

47
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,649
mechanism where people can complain when

48
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,570
there's a systemic issues or

49
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:09,149
interpersonal conflict things of that

50
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,940
sort I would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the office to be seen</font>

51
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,970
much more as a resource

52
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:16,970
and to intervene at a very early stage

53
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:20,350
when there is conflict that is a that is

54
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">somehow impeding progress or or</font>

55
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:25,519
undermining relationships in the

56
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:28,010
community as a resource for the

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,080
community I can get in at the very early

58
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,470
stages when when conflict which is a

59
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,600
good thing I mean you need conflicts to

60
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:38,300
to to obtain progress I mean if there's

61
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,010
no conflict nothing gets done but when

62
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,360
conflict turns to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point where it</font>

63
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,600
actually interferes in people's

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,910
relationships and things become more

65
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,710
inefficient and less effective<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

66
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,630
hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would turn to the</font>

67
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,330
office of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ombudsman as a resource to</font>

68
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:56,660
get in there early<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help solve</font>

69
00:02:53,330 --> 00:03:01,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of those smaller problems it it</font>

70
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:04,370
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an informal approach so rather</font>

71
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">than waiting until things grow to the</font>

72
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,120
point where an official complaint has to

73
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,060
be made I would much<font color="#CCCCCC"> rather solve those</font>

74
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,850
issues at a very early stage and as

75
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:17,090
informal as possible and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> also at</font>

76
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:20,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same time will be actively promoting</font>

77
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:23,090
the the new I can expected standards of

78
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,959
behavior which i believe is is an

79
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:29,660
important tool if you wish<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font>

80
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,209
can now point to and say this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

81
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:36,260
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are supposed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> act in a community in</font>

82
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:39,410
a in relationships and people can

83
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,299
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> then identify the behaviors</font>

84
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,850
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they should be using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

85
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,650
community and hopefully become role

86

models for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> newcomers and the younger</font>
