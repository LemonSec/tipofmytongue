this meeting first of all it was

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">extremely well attended meeting so that</font>

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,480
meant the interest level was high<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

were quite pleased<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that in this</font>

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,050
first meeting after the transition means

18
00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:00,539
that everybody the board and everybody

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,959
in the community is eager<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see where</font>

20
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,869
we turn our attention where the focus is

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,140
and where we are going to be expending

22
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:13,979
our energy and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the sort of</font>

the new checks and balances it is

32
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,639
important to clear out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> roles so we</font>

35
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,399
that's where the policy-making is

36
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,189
actually happening the board takes those

37
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,770
look at them takes advice and instructs

38
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,740
me to go and implement them and that is

39
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,860
a very good that's a very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

40
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,079
of looking at the ropes see if there was

41
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,420
an unusually<font color="#CCCCCC"> large number of new board</font>

42
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,798
members coming into the I can during

43
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,000
this meeting it's about losing the

44
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,190
institutional memory at a time when it

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,280
needs it most that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

46
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,120
well we

47
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,490
must and replace 25 members of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board</font>

48
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:23,690
that's higher than normal but only by

49
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:25,160
one or<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and it's perfectly expected</font>

50
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,800
that there will be fluctuation it's not

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,600
a it's not a the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> number every year</font>

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,850
so it's within I mean it's not

53
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,810
extraordinary it's just a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> larger</font>

54
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:37,400
than usual we have lost some people who

55
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:43,970
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been on the board quite a long time</font>

56
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:45,920
and those losses are felt and but the

57
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,750
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are coming in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and i must say</font>

58
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">are quite good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been quite impressed</font>

59
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:54,050
all five of the new people are very

60
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">strong experienced and eager</font>

62
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,239
and they'll come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to speed already are</font>

63
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">in fact we have a new introduction</font>

64
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,760
program that precedes their formal term

65
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:10,268
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just started and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font>

66
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,190
they've all hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ground running</font>

67
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:15,380
you're on you've now been to a couple of

68
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,910
ICANN meetings since you assumed

69
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,829
leadership brains that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

observations about these meetings and

00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:26,299
the way they are conducted observation I

73
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,769
do which I knew before<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming in but</font>

74
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:30,709
it's very hard before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're actually</font>

75
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:33,650
experiences with the level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of passion of</font>

76
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,870
the people coming to the meetings it is

77
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:38,060
a extraordinary<font color="#E5E5E5"> sight to see all those</font>

78
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,970
volunteers coming into a meeting and

79
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,690
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> very long and very hard days and</font>

80
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:48,560
this meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has been very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font>

81
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:50,269
it's amazing now come I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

82
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,579
feels a little bit tired<font color="#E5E5E5"> after meeting</font>

83
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:54,320
like this but I also feel a great sense

84
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:57,380
of gratitude for everybody who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

85
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,079
involved Steve one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the issues</font>

86
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,780
addressed at ICANN 57 is that of

87
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:05,510
accountability and transparency since

88
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,220
the transition which specific areas has

89
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,370
icons accountability and transparency

90
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,739
improved one of the primary elements

91
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:17,440
underlying the entire thrust of

92
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:20,349
accountability transparency has been to

93
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,289
for the community to feel confident that

94
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:25,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">the board and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization is being</font>

95
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:29,110
responsive and

96
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:31,910
providing accurate timely information

97
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:36,290
just speaking with respect to what goes

98
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:39,230
on inside the board we have were quite

99
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,000
eager to be as helpful as we can we've

100
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,760
been making a point of looking for all

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,150
of the opportunities large and small to

102
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:50,719
be more forthcoming and and to take the

103
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:52,250
message<font color="#CCCCCC"> to heart and not just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stand on</font>

104
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,050
formality and say we don't have to do

105
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,850
this because if you read the rules this

106
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,700
way just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go entirely the other way</font>

107
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:02,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">and say how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can we be as open and as</font>

108
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,849
helpful as possible there was in the

109
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:08,480
early<font color="#E5E5E5"> days of the accountability process</font>

110
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:11,360
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people talking as if the board</font>

111
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,460
was purposely being resistant I can tell

112
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,380
you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was never the case and that</font>

113
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,289
we stood silently for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while to let</font>

114
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,670
this play out but we're as delighted as

115
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,350
anybody we're part of the community

116
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,050
would come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community where you</font>

117
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">know but there's no real difference in</font>

118
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:29,150
motivation so we're eager for this and

119
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,219
as I say we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been looking for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font>

120
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,349
sort of opportunity is now part of our

121
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,110
thinking at every step how do we make

122
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:40,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">this more open how do we make it more</font>

123
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:43,490
sensible and accessible to the community

124
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:45,289
may I continue on the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

125
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,810
because it is very important and in the

126
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,350
dialogue<font color="#CCCCCC"> between me and the board we're</font>

127
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,540
starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work on those things because</font>

128
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,200
we also come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conclusion</font>

129
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">transparencies much more than the</font>

130
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,280
disclosure you have to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

131
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,160
the material they have to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to</font>

132
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,409
know the material exists and that's why

133
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">we for instance now have changed storage</font>

134
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,980
here to format of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> quarterly of</font>

135
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,550
stakeholder calls which we now do in

136
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:12,470
regional to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit that note</font>

137
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">other things we are doing which may be</font>

138
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,690
small things but you have to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

139
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:20,359
into a smaller context is the when we're

140
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:22,490
now going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> add a complaint officer to</font>

141
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,170
the icon organization where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will take</font>

142
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,900
in complaints<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we will also publish</font>

143
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,580
the complaints and the answers to it so

144
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,349
we make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people understand if</font>

145
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,210
