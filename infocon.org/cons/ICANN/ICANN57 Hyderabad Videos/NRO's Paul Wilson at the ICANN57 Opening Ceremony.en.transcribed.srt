all very happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that thing is behind</font>

57
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:33,340
us now because like you all we worked

58
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,500
very hard on the task the rars over

59
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,270
quite a few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> had called publicly</font>

00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:42,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">occasions when the ICANN arrangements</font>

62

were being reviewed or under renewal by

63
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,170
the US government so when the time came

64
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,890
we assembled the crisp team the combined

plan which became a part of the IC<font color="#CCCCCC"> geez</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">same time or after that we work together</font>

71
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,390
with I can very successfully to

72
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,150
implement that transition plan in the

73
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,488
form of a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreement and that's the</font>

agreement between the rars and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I came</font>

for the provision<font color="#E5E5E5"> of iono services we</font>

76
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,260
signed that agreement at the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> icon</font>

77
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,208
meeting in Helsinki and it became active

78
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,609
on the first of October and I think we

79
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,590
should in the numbers community we

80
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,200
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to thank the icon staff and</font>

83
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,890
quite lucky actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the numbers</font>

84
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:39,130
world to have what is really a clean and

85
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">clear relationship with I can such that</font>

86
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,209
it can be defined in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> document of just</font>

87
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a few pages and that document</font>

88
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:47,730
also by the way defines icons

89
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,600
accountabilities in those same few pages

90
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,440
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I cans</font>

91
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,150
accountability is not the full extent of

92
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,829
overall accountability in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers</font>

93
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,720
space and the RR themselves have got our

94
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:01,630
own set of accountabilities which we

95
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,030
take very seriously we were prompted in

96
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,440
fact early in the transition<font color="#E5E5E5"> process to</font>

97
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,290
launch our own accountability

98
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,239
improvement efforts and so for instance

99
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,608
we've published a guide in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> form of</font>

governance mechanisms of all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rars</font>

102
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,880
we've undertaken an independent

103
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:22,210
accountability review of the individual

104
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,840
rars as independent membership based

105
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,690
community organizations

106
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,198
and our next<font color="#CCCCCC"> effort as if this week will</font>

107
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:32,090
be to launch the latest open public and

independent review<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the address</font>

supporting organization but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font>

110
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,100
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as Steve said actually this work</font>

111
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,660
will go on individually among the rars

112
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,639
and together<font color="#E5E5E5"> between us to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ensure that</font>

113
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:48,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">our accountabilities are up to scratch</font>

114
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:50,419
as time<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes on into the future so aside</font>

115
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,120
from all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's business</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as usual</font>

116
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:55,520
for the rars in some sense we're working

117
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,650
as we always<font color="#CCCCCC"> have on the operational</font>

118
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,870
technical and policy challenges of the

numbers community in terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> of addressing</font>

122
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,820
the world one of those challenges

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:14,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually and not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a new one is another</font>

124

transition which is from ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ipv6 as</font>

125
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:19,940
the protocol which ultimately carries

all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other Internet services I'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">glad to say that ipv6 is continuing to</font>

128
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:28,039
increase steadily to today<font color="#E5E5E5"> around seven</font>

percent of all internet users in the

00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:33,020
world and that's doubled since I came 52

131
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,180
it accounts for fourteen percent of

132
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:40,120
Google's user traffic which is also

133
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:44,570
doubled and these days the USA leads the

134
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,370
ipv6 tables with around<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80 million users</font>

136
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,470
again doubled in the last 18 months so

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sounds good and it is good but</font>

138
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:56,270
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to realize that the majority of</font>
