00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,879
role did you play in that the NC you see

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,449
we have several active member in the

<font color="#E5E5E5">since the beginning and the two tracks</font>

for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inner transition and the icon</font>

21
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,439
accountability and we have really active

22
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,689
people who participated<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the drafting</font>

23
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:10,429
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion and consultation and</font>

24
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:14,460
so on and we submitted our own comments

25
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:19,140
so we had really it was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our main</font>

26
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,699
priority in the last two years so it's

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,390
quite important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to make the</font>

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,100
organization more accountable and

advocating for the eyelid transition

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,809
even outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can in particular for</font>

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,449
civil society and because there are so

32
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,490
many they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not familiar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in how I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

33
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,500
it works and there are several<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs</font>

34
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,490
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> icon however even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with all those</font>

35
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,530
discussion regarding an asteroid ship

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,610
transition and I can accountability

37
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:51,440
there are still several important policy

38
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:54,770
process that we have to participate and

39
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:58,220
in the last month we get really<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

40
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:01,130
heavy policy the one like the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld</font>

41
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,140
to review what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> before the</font>

42
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:06,860
rights protection mechanism of the most

43
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:09,889
sensitive and we do think that we have

44
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,650
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect more the individual</font>

00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:15,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">registrant on that matter there is also</font>

46
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:18,110
the RDS the registration directory

47
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:21,290
service or this idea of changing who is

48
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,480
in for us is quite critical because for

49
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,730
many years we advocated for protecting

50
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,310
the privacy and ensuring the data

51
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:31,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">protection of registrants right very</font>

52
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,200
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rafiq and I understand you</font>

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,290
counselor congratulations and what do

56
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:44,030
council or the wider Gina so over the

57
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:48,950
next two years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're going to</font>

58
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:51,560
be a counselor general counsel as the

59
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,950
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the entity or the body managing</font>

60
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,709
the process stealing them doing kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

61
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:01,700
oversight to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font>

62
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:07,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">developing the policies it get kind of</font>

63
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:10,280
more in new role because the is the new

64
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,480
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of new structuring we got with the</font>

65
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">an assertive transition with the</font>

66
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Empowered community and you are still</font>

67
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:18,080
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how to handle that</font>

68
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,549
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the general counsel but also the</font>

69
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,959
different stakeholder group and

70
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:28,220
constituency that form the gns oh so for

71
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:30,290
the council is kind of not in short red

72
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:34,160
I'll say uncharted territory territory

73
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,950
but it's kind of to see how to mainly to

74
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,530
become more relevant because one of the

75
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,060
risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the genus or cancel just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two to</font>

76
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,120
get in the routine and chest you know

77
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,700
handling processes being more formally

78
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">stinking term of procedure and rules</font>

79
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,980
which can be kind of confusing for many

80
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:55,960
new camera they don't understand why<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

81
00:03:51,980 --> 00:04:00,620
geneseo matter it will be tempted<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

82
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:04,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">tenting to sail make the genus oh great</font>

83
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,200
again however it's a great already I

84
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:11,000
think the general counsel need maybe to

85
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:13,280
me to be kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more not assertive but</font>

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,298
to work more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more really to ensure</font>

87
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all the policy we have to be</font>

88
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:23,060
development and debate we have several

89
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:25,070
kind of projects to do so it's

90
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:29,330
challenging for me because I was in

91
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:31,700
general<font color="#E5E5E5"> counsel till 2012 that was a</font>

92
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">different word in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time the whole</font>

93
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,330
discussion was about the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld</font>

94
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:39,410
program nobody were thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

95
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:41,120
anesthesia transition so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am coming as</font>

96
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,220
really for me it's kind of a new

97
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,990
experience because there are so many

98
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,680
things that changes in 10 in the four

99
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:50,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">years and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also bringing my kind of</font>

100
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,640
experience at the chair which is more

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,040
like to support my own group to be

102
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,289
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the processes and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the policy</font>

103
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,840
discussion while I'm not involve it

104
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:02,210
personally now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am back more to that</font>

105
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,539
drawn to be able to be more close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

106
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:07,609
policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for that I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help also my</font>

107
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,979
groups to get more updates of what's

108
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:13,720
happening where we need to be involved

109
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:15,800
