13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,110
David I think all of us could feel a

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,910
collective sigh of relief when the iono

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,370
transition was completed earlier last

16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,290
month and while that marked the end of a

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,640
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years of cumulative effort on</font>

18
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,660
the part of the community it kicked off

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,190
a new era in the history of I can and

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Gianna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so as an important</font>

21
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,079
contributor to that community we have to

22
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,550
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we're going to</font>

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">participate effectively in this post</font>

24
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,419
iono environment and with regard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your</font>

25
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,620
question about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting schedules I</font>

26
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,270
think we're still getting our legs

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,009
underneath us a little bit i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've</font>

28
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,240
become creatures of habit and knowing

29
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,909
that certain sessions are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to play</font>

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,830
take place on certain days that was

31
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,659
disrupted a little bit with meeting be

32
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,250
in Helsinki and it's been disrupted

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,650
quite a bit with this meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

34
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,150
Hyderabad but generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

35
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,759
it's going to demonstrate that the

36
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,840
community as a whole and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gina so in</font>

37
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,600
particular is flexible and can adapt to

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,180
address these new challenges and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Donna</font>

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,770
the gns<font color="#CCCCCC"> o has established a number of</font>

40
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,689
new work students to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take on these new</font>

41
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,369
challenges that<font color="#E5E5E5"> James talked about their</font>

42
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,350
run of a particular impact on how the

43
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,360
gns or<font color="#E5E5E5"> interact with the rest of the</font>

44
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,030
community and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm thinking your</font>

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,590
particular the bylaws drafting team the

46
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">appointment of a new liaison to the GAC</font>

47
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,420
and the appointment<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an interim gns or</font>

48
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,070
representative to the Empowered

49
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,420
community how do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think these</font>

50
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,419
initiatives are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> affect the way</font>

51
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,979
the gns or works so David I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think to</font>

52
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">some extent it's not going to be a</font>

53
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,869
significant change to the way that the

54
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,939
genus o operates but understanding that

55
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:04,740
we do have new responsibilities as a

56
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,990
result and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up into those</font>

57
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,910
when it you know at any point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

58
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,130
we consider that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's necessary to do so</font>

59
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,260
I think with the

60
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,540
you know the drafting team on the bylaws

61
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,609
that's an important discussion that's

62
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,410
going on at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment and we are seeing</font>

63
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,880
that there are some sensitivities into

64
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,650
some of the you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the roles for the</font>

65
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,320
genus oh and particularly how the

66
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,600
council fits into some of those you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

67
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">new roles or the way that by laws have</font>

68
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,370
been drafted<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you know the</font>

69
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,829
critical initiative for us is a

70
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,380
continuation of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GAC liaison role the</font>

71
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">relationship that the genus o Council in</font>

72
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,640
particular has with the GAC we need to

73
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,190
evolve that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we need to establish a</font>

74
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,010
better better communications<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

76
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,899
also get a better a better understanding

77
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,460
of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what our different roles and</font>

78
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,390
responsibilities that are moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward</font>

102
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:51,450
we have a foot I'm quite numerous I'm

103
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,640
quite voluminous in terms of their scope

104
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,260
and there's quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on and I</font>

110
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,708
big issues and we're finding that there

111
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,420
are some significant overlaps between

112
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,820
several of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> PDP's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've</font>

115
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,709
I'm and I think we'll see that it's time

<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tackle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these bigger questions</font>

117
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,960
I also think that what we'll see is

118
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,139
either

119
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,840

the PDP's<font color="#CCCCCC"> We certainly have a number of</font>

number of review teams that are being

on largely what Heather said I think one

of the challenges for the genus our
