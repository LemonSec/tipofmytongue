that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition was very smooth and</font>

that all of the transactions on a daily

excellent

the security of the domain name system

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,679
is another important priority of I can

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course we're currently involved in a</font>

00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,750
carefully planned effort to change or

186
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">roll over as we say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cryptographic</font>

keys that help secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> the domain name</font>

188
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,860
system this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an unprecedented effort</font>

189
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,350
and it will conclude about a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

now we're involved in global effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

191
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,529
make sure that network operators

195
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,800
our goal is make certain that none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

them will be locked out once the

197
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,740
cryptographic keys are changed this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

198
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:16,339
pretty big<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal we hope it goes</font>

199
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:18,410
completely smoothly and it's the kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

200
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:20,390
thing that from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> conceptual point of</font>

201
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:23,300
view ought to be done relatively quickly

202
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:26,630
but we an extraordinary amount of

203
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:29,630
caution care testing communication etc

204
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:31,760
is being put into this it's also

205
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,640
important that we understand and openly

206
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,819
engage in a dialogue around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

207
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,310
aspects of the domain name system

208
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:42,890
nothing stays<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same we understand</font>

209
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:45,890
pretty well the position we're in but

210
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:48,770
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agent of change and</font>

211
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:51,279
likely we will see changes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

212
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:54,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">environment and we feel obliged to</font>

213
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,830
embrace that rather than either ignored

214
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:59,719
or resist it among other things one

215
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,660
hears a lot about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet of Things</font>

216
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will bring a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very large number</font>

217
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:09,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">of new devices not tied to individuals</font>

218
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:11,209
and so the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of devices will be not</font>

219
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,510
measured by the population of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

220
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:16,969
but measured by some other big numbers

221
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:18,920
how will that transform the naming

222
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,440
marketplace is obviously of key

223
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,819
importance so a robust discussion will

224
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,250
take place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will help us prioritize</font>

our future endeavors<font color="#E5E5E5"> and our approach we</font>

226
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,470
know full well the world is watching

227
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:35,149
closely very closely how I

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:38,029
post-transition i kin community handles

229
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:39,920
its newfound role and much of its focus

230
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:41,370
will be on those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you who are involved</font>

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">in I can</font>

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:47,220
and in our collective responsibilities

233
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,810
of accountability and transparency and I

234
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,510
have to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board is one hundred</font>

235
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:53,430
percent supportive there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been times</font>

236
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,960
when it was not thought that that was

237
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,120
the case i can assure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you from the</font>

238
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,150
beginning the board was always very

239
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,610
supportive I don't want to get into an

240
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,800
argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it but there was less</font>

241
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:08,089
resistance in fact zero resistance

242
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,010
despite what<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody might have thought</font>

243
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:13,440
much of the focus as I said we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on</font>

244
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,900
the people who are involved directly

245
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,570
this meeting is the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> post</font>

scrutinized and probably over<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysed</font>

248
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,660
but I've every confidence in the
