24
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:32,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to cover today is you know one is with a</font>

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,970
focus on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iot and the m2m space but</font>

26
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,369
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only that what you know the keynote</font>

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,140
speaker<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said that while india has a</font>

28
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,970
large number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are connected</font>

29
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,799
but we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the privilege of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

30
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,048
largest<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of people not connected</font>

31
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,820
so how you going to you know while we

32
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about the numbers were connected</font>

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,408
but how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the folks who</font>

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">are not yet connected connected and you</font>

35
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,450
know is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> a role within that of i</font>

36
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,790
can or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> governance</font>

37
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:03,960
mechanisms and what what can help with

38
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:08,009
that a brief I'll just take about where

39
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,449
we stand on the internet space in India

40
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,809
of course the size of the markets been

41
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,799
mentioned rural market very important

42
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,050
thing is about spectrum

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,480
which has been auctioned so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's</font>

44
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,890
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> international gathering you know</font>

45
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">something's we in India have done pretty</font>

46
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,750
well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the many things we could have</font>

47
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,900
done better and that is possibly the

48
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,480
reason why so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> are still unconnected</font>

49
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:33,000
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it that we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do better</font>

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,070
which could<font color="#E5E5E5"> also provide an example to</font>

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rest of the community</font>

52
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:40,340
internationally who possibly would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

53
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:42,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at the efforts that we have here</font>

54
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,870
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new technologies in vogue</font>

55
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,520
I'm sure Ruth will cover some of that

56
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:53,310
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of discussion on Wi-Fi</font>

57
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:56,220
offload or Lauren<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you know projects</font>

58
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,890
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> loon or satellite based or the</font>

59
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,990
drones so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more that's</font>

60
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,940
happening and just yesterday I was

61
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,250
reading how Facebook has put up you know

62
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,200
open opened up<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the hardware as</font>

63
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:11,880
open source which anybody can

64
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,929
manufacture as well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have is</font>

65
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:18,359
there was a mention in the brief<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ok</font>

66
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,830
there's a always a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a debatable</font>

67
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,690
how many people actually connected in

68
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,080
India and what the statistics are what

69
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,540
was mentioned was 462 million I internet

70
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,070
subscribers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not really where</font>

71
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,959
the big challenges the challenge I think

72
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be more and how do you build up</font>

73
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,270
the two-dollar<font color="#CCCCCC"> ARPU that we have so we</font>

74
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,570
are about thirteen percent of the

75
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:42,900
internet you know total number of people

76
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:45,480
connected as telecom subscribers because

77
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,250
more or less we have here we only have

78
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,530
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> network that's the mobile wireless</font>

79
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,959
network unlike many other countries

80
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,190
which have you know developed countries

81
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,080
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a very extensive</font>

82
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,090
wireline networks where people who

83
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,970
already connected up to a phone line and

84
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,280
you had a cable TV network on that plus

85
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,910
a satellite network here there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

86
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:09,170
one network and I guess that's that's

87
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,340
also a similar feature in most you know

88
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,470
developing countries or countries which

89
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,570
are not yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> got most of the people</font>

90
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,760
connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto the internet so the fact</font>

91
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:22,440
that the mobile broadband and the mobile

92
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">wireless internet will be a lot of area</font>

93
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,020
of focus and let's see how that would

94
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,450
help

95
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:34,280
with that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the what we'll do is</font>

96
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,880
what God mentioned was what are the

97
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,880
initiatives<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the Indian government</font>

98
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,919
is done so of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course we have euro the</font>

99
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:49,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">National optical fiber network to have a</font>

100
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:51,450
a good secure resilient scalable fiber

101
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,150
network because whatever much you meant

102
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:57,300
do on the wireless but the backbone<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

103
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">takeaway has to be extensively on fiber</font>

104
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,310
so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of effort going but</font>

105
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,050
there I think we have we could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

106
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,840
much better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than we have we've been</font>

107
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:10,980
speaking about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the last 45 years</font>

108
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,330
but the targets which were to be met had

109
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,800
not been met so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

110
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,580
learning as to what you should not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

111
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,140
done in the way we handle that part and

112
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,120
let's see how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are handling the next</font>

113
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,590
part the other good news is the smart

114
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,940
cities in the digital India program so

115
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:31,260
what I'm is that telecom is driven

116
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,550
centrally urine in many countries but

117
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,610
the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you are dependent on a</font>

118
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,950
federal structure are in states for

119
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,300
issues like<font color="#CCCCCC"> right-of-way or even you</font>

120
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:42,630
know if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deliver services</font>

121
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,940
over m2m or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT so where the</font>

122
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,760
education sector of the health sector or

123
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,210
the transportation sector are areas for

124
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,310
rules regulations and compliance are

125
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,960
under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the state governments so it's not</font>

126
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">just your interaction of the regulatory</font>

127
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,620
policies at the center but also your

128
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:03,630
interactions at the local and municipal

129
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:05,850
levels where you know 5g or the IOT or

130
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,340
m2m service delivery will actually take

131
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,350
place so how do you handle that part is

132
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">something which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope will be able to</font>

133
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,840
cover so straight off with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as a</font>

134
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,900
background I'll request Rohit to cover

135
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,119
you know as narrowband IOT and your

136
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,739
experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> in other geographies how</font>

137
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,710
that's happening and what's the

138
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:28,590
relevance here in India sure sure thank

139
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,239
you thanks for the introduction I just

140
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,489
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say maybe a couple of more</font>

141
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,229
things about myself to kind of put

142
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,810
things in perspective you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for</font>

143
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:37,960
everybody about you know where Matt my

144
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,660
torts are going to come

from so I've you know been in qualcomm

146
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:47,919
R&D for almost about 15 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

147
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,719
know I've I've kind of been there from

148
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,099
the beginning of you know when<font color="#CCCCCC"> went</font>

149
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">eight I was being enabled over cellular</font>

150
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:55,659
in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first project I worked on</font>

151
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,940
you know it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> really kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of trying to</font>

152
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,220
enable that and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I worked on you</font>

153
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,919
know more 3g technologies also worked on

154
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,590
LT you know travel to standardization

155
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:06,940
forums you know evangelize technology

156
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,710
you know with various operators around

157
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,320
the world so that's that's kind of my

158
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:14,349
background right so so kind of with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

159
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,479
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want to kind of point out</font>

160
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:18,669
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think today there's I</font>

161
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,219
feel is a lot of excitement in you know

162
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:23,710
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cellular industry in the sense</font>

163
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,720
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the technologies that have</font>

164
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,479
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> their other better coming out</font>

165
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,949
over the last year last couple of years

166
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,090
through the standardization process as

167
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">well as a lot of companies are making</font>

168
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,289
announcements on the cellular side I

169
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,359
think they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

170
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:41,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide enormous benefits to to kind of</font>

171
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,909
enable adoption of IOT and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

172
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,009
what's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of leading the way in all of</font>

173
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:46,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">this in my view on the cellular side is</font>

174
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:48,070
essentially the things that are

175
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> LT side and I'm going</font>

176
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,729
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe like you know walk through</font>

177
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,169
through a few of those but just to kind

178
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:55,719
of take a step back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and give a</font>

179
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:57,159
perspective on cellular itself and then

180
00:07:55,719 --> 00:08:00,880
why we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a very good fit for</font>

181
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:04,000
for IOT technologies so basically what's

182
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,130
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keynote speaker</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

183
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,229
mentioned that that security is kind of

184
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,150
a big deal you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in today's world</font>

185
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:11,380
specially<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber security and we think</font>

186
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger issue</font>

187
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,490
when it comes to IOT technologies so

188
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,919
what what it a high level you know

189
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,750
cellular brings is kind of a security

190
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,479
mechanism which has pretty much been

191
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,219
unbreached for four decades right and

192
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,570
and you know if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

193
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:28,000
evolution of security over cellular

194
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,979
networks it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten much much more</font>

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,449
secure much better with you know with

196
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:33,789
with LT even compared to previous

197
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:36,039
technologies like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3G so so that's kind</font>

198
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:37,990
of an enormous<font color="#E5E5E5"> benefit I feel that you</font>

199
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,250
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that cellular brings right this</font>

200
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of hole into end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thought-out</font>

201
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">security model which which has worked in</font>

202
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,219
practice very nicely right other than

203
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,650
that you know the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's kind</font>

204
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">of pretty much ubiquitous coverage of</font>

205
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,160
cellular

206
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,160
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much everywhere I think</font>

207
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a huge huge advantage for</font>

208
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,579
you know for IOT devices you know

209
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,220
getting into little bit more specific

210
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,750
specifics of envy<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT since the since</font>

211
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,910
the moderator you know ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to touch</font>

212
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,050
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that a little bit so what's</font>

213
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,060
happened in the last couple of years

214
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,579
with with LTE technology in particular

215
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:12,300
is that you know there's kind of been a

216
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:15,600
few key areas which which you know if

217
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:18,089
which which I really sort of evolved a

218
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,790
few few few key different aspects in

219
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:23,670
terms of making end devices becoming

220
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,560
very suitable for IOT and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

221
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:29,310
three axis of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I defy if I really</font>

222
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,369
look at our our<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs you know power</font>

223
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:35,280
consumption as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know coverage</font>

224
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,720
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll touch upon each of these so so</font>

225
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,400
kind of what's happened in the standards

226
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,910
process over the last couple of years is

227
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a cost point of view you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

228
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,600
the cellular industry has defined new

229
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,960
standards which are which are under the

230
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">gambit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> envy IOT which which kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

231
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">allow you to build very very simple low</font>

232
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,710
cost low cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> end devices and then</font>

233
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,450
Qualcomm another company that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also kind</font>

234
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">of have announced projects towards that</font>

235
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,070
so these should really help bring the

236
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:04,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the you know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of ownership of</font>

237
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:06,210
m2m down you know over time the second

238
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,680
axis where where a lot of progress has

239
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,180
been made is in power consumption

240
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,650
because ideally what you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

241
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,719
do is say you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a water</font>

242
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,220
meter you you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just kind of throw</font>

243
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,780
it in your basement and<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave it for 10</font>

244
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,310
years for example right<font color="#CCCCCC"> without having</font>

245
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,000
to worry about recharging batteries and

246
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,920
so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's an enormous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

247
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,970
of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know technology advancement</font>

248
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,370
that's happened in the last couple of

249
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,260
years in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know adding new</font>

250
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,240
features simplifying a lot of protocols

251
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,980
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extent that you know cellular</font>

252
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,930
technologies can actually run these NBD

253
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,300
IOT technologies can run on microsec

254
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,130
micro amps of of current which if

255
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,020
anybody is familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you know</font>

256
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,939
with cellular technology is not where

257
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,220
where you know where our smartphones are

258
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,780
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example right and the third axis</font>

259
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,330
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point out is the one</font>

260
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,920
of coverage because so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of</font>

261
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,680
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> very key for a lot of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

262
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,420
applications in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entirety space</font>

263
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,089
because you know again ideally what you

264
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,560
want is that you you want sort of you

265
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,000
know coverage coming all the way to your

266
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,469
basement for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you want to</font>

267
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to throw in a power meter water</font>

268
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,230

269
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,910
or some sensors there and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not</font>

270
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,379
have to worry about you know is my

271
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,540
cellular coverage reaching there or not

272
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:11,250
right so with these new advancements

273
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,740
that are happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NB IOT space</font>

274
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,990
in LT it will enable you to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

275
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,879
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily be able to cover basements</font>

276
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,920
in your house or maybe different<font color="#E5E5E5"> floors</font>

277
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:21,149
or you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> different parts of</font>

278
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,128
your house that with today's technology

279
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:25,740
are perhaps a little bit more difficult

280
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:27,660
to cover it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel that that a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

281
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,029
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are coming together the</font>

282
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,639
right price points you know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as</font>

283
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:33,990
these types of advancements and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

284
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,269
another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention is that there's</font>

285
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,699
also kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of leading into what's what's</font>

286
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:40,350
being planned for 5g as well so 5 G's

287
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,508
kind of going to take this another step

288
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,189
forward and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to enable</font>

289
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:46,680
you know over the next I would say two

290
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:48,689
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> four years you know use cases</font>

291
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,489
which are which which can somewhat be

292
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:52,230
addressed with for example LT like

293
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,810
technologies today but kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of take it</font>

294
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,579
another step forward and and chief among

295
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,258
these these use cases are mission

296
00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:00,719
critical use cases like for example if

297
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,910
you want you know industrial control you

298
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,100
know through cellular technologies so 5

299
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:08,189
G's kind of gearing up to build very

300
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,769
very low latency you know capabilities

301
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:12,360
on you know over the air and then so

302
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:13,949
even those types of markets you know

303
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,899
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely open up for IOT over</font>

304
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:17,160
cellular so overall<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we see huge</font>

305
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,350
excitement just to kind of summarize

306
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,779
sort of in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> one sentence I think maybe</font>

307
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,250
about 15 to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years back we were all</font>

308
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,829
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

309

310
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,829
back and till today we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

311
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:31,859
connecting you know people to servers

312
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:33,209
and machines<font color="#CCCCCC"> aka data right and now we</font>

313
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,920
are kind of connecting machines to

314
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:37,138
machines right and everywhere every each

315
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,509
of these problems has has a very

316
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:41,130
different challenges and as has led to

317
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:43,560
tremendous amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of innovation I feel</font>

318
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:45,240
so so very exciting times I<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel ya Roy</font>

thank you very much I think you know

320
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,880

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:53,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of excitement now the excitement</font>

322
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,649

325
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:05,009
kind of enabling policy measures do you

good enough oh you know what are the

00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,170
more enabling policy measures you think

that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could take in India which could</font>

as well your<font color="#E5E5E5"> thoughts Thank You Vikram</font>

347
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:09,670
then I will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming to the point that</font>

348
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:12,640
how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet as you are saying the</font>

349
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:17,069
policy affects the penetration of the

00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,069
broadband or through much into machine

351
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:23,830
in our country when the broad internet

352
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:28,420
was opened by our formal<font color="#CCCCCC"> prime minister</font>

lat LG and after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the licensing was</font>

354
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:38,020
framed we we are expecting a lot of

00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:43,209
change that the policy and the

technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go together but what I</font>

357
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:51,189
found after lot of deliberations since

1999<font color="#CCCCCC"> till date because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am connected</font>

359
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:58,990
from 1999 till date somehow the

360
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:04,510
government which should be doing the

361
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:10,750
work of governance projected themselves

362
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:15,490
as a businessman what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

363
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:18,760
the government governance that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:23,050
government wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> project or improve</font>

365
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:27,010
any industry this support directly or

366
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:29,109
indirectly like in few of the northeast

367
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:31,839
India or in some

368
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:35,019
hilaria where there is no industrial

369
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,060
development government supports them

370
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:39,220
that if you will be putting the industry

371
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:43,268
over there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be getting a lot of</font>

372
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:48,690
subsidy and lot of benefits in terms of

00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:48,690
taxation in terms of other facilities

374
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:56,829
knowing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet will be the future</font>

375
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:59,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and internet will be the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

376
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:04,050
communication solution that everything

377
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,050
has to come on the IP and the packets

378
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:14,860
somehow I found that we have limited

379
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:17,560
ourselves to the one sector only in

380
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:21,190
numbers we can say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are thirteen</font>

she is the digitally literate if we want

<font color="#CCCCCC">that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet should be penetrated</font>

00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:45,890
this gap will increase day by day local

entrepreneur local<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP can do the work</font>

444
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:51,030
of digital literacy

445
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:55,050
this confidence should come into the

446
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:58,139
local ISPs and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp sector needs a</font>

jack they don't need a financial support

448
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:05,250
they need only a<font color="#CCCCCC"> jack so that Internet</font>

00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,740
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be penetrated I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering what</font>

450
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,020
that Jack is so could you dwell on what

451
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,680
that jackets but notwithstanding that

452
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:16,740
the ISP CP you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting yesterday</font>

453
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,220
highlighted that the universal

454
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:22,110
acceptance you know and they were

455
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,940
published that in Hindi as well so this

456
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">is for the audience maybe you would like</font>

00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go and see the Hindi version of I</font>

459
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,860
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> published and there was one</font>

460
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,170
discussion about having you know

461
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,540
internet ambassadors so do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font>

462
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:40,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for people who would be</font>

464
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:46,260
rural areas I think you know uber and

465
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:48,659
Ola have done a fantastic job of self

466
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:51,480
learning here I sit in the car<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

467
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:53,370
guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know Google Maps is being read</font>

468
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,280
out in English but he's figuring out how

469
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:58,110
to use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay whether the uber can be</font>

470
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,389
used in to the village of the Haryana

471
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:03,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">suppler where the uber service is not</font>

472
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:05,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">there whether the uber can be available</font>

473
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,760
in to the villages<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Andhra where</font>

474
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,290
nobody knows about the uber and

475
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,170
regarding your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jack what Jack I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am</font>

476
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:16,680
saying recently the government has

477
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:18,900
introduced<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6% EGR on the pure internet</font>

478
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,180
and broadband in spite knowing he that

479
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:24,450
there is no internet penetration at all

480
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:26,490
and the total recovery on account of the

481
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,820
six percent EGR is hardly hundred

482
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:32,880
clothes and at the other hand government

483
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:35,129
is investing 80,000 code for the barnett

484
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,600
so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting i think you know</font>

485
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,280
different arms of the government whether

486
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,169
they are lined and actually promoting

487
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,510
internet or only<font color="#E5E5E5"> promoting you know</font>

488
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:45,300
upfront money being sucked out of the

489
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:47,070
system so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> open question and that</font>

490
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,840
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something for other countries</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to note</font>

491
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,189
and if their regulators from other

492
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,020
countries don't take the money out of

493
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system up front and leave nothing</font>

494
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,240
for being put inside growth of the

495
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,340
networks I think we've goofed up in

496
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,180
India on that so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't follow us</font>

497
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,179
on that part at least

498
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:07,419
700 megahertz for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I essentially</font>

499
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,130
you know I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have it essentially</font>

500
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:12,100
it is spectrum over which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will</font>

501
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:15,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide the access unit mentioned for</font>

502
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:18,850
m2m or<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT there would be some mission</font>

503
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,429
critical services for which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need low</font>

504
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,770
latency continuous access of a very high

505
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:25,480
order but there could be let's say you

506
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:29,020
know he mentioned about a sim card

507
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:31,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting in a power meter or agricultural</font>

508
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,610
sensors which could only be chopping

509
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,168
like birds once in a while and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

510
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,418
there's connectivity you know maybe

511
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:39,850
middle of the night where this low they

512
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:46,540
could do their data transfer with that

513
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:50,110
I'll turn around<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to my colleague here</font>

514
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:52,330
and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I win a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big data right how do</font>

515
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,520
you see in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways but all this is</font>

516
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:59,080
actually generating a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data and</font>

517
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:01,720
you know much of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the m2m and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT</font>

518
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,600
will depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how best you can utilize</font>

519
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,970
that data and of course affordability of

520
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,830
services so some of the questions that

521
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,500
come about is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok you've got this data</font>

522
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:14,460
now and as an analytics person how you

523
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:18,240
seeing our Indian companies or companies

524
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:20,500
internationally using this data and

525
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,140
processing it whether it's through the

526
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,360
cloud or otherwise and in which part of

527
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:28,210
the network to provide affordability

528
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,799
because it is a dress you know because

529
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,290
much of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are not yet</font>

530
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:34,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">connected one of the major reasons is is</font>

531
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:37,770
it affordable is internet access

532
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:40,860
affordable and what can we all at I can

533
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:45,639
do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and make it more affordable</font>

534
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:47,918
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> thnkx forum so so my role as I</font>

535
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,320
manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data management analytics a</font>

536
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,450
function at virtusa Polaris so

537
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,290
essentially when we work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

538
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:57,880
customers the data is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already you know</font>

539
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:01,360
available through the connectivity

540
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,790
through the through the m2m so on and so

541
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,740
forth but the real challenge is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

542
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:08,379
volumes of data we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are talking about a</font>

543
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:11,100
tremendous I mean I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> data management</font>

544
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:14,680
has matured significantly in the last

545
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:17,770
few years but still we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not seen the</font>

546
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:20,110
the full capability<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what data can be</font>

547
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,670
generated so in fact in the morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

548
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:25,360
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting discussion</font>

549
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:28,270
on how or where should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we even process</font>

550
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,070
the data should<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be processed at the</font>

551
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:33,310
edge which is essentially closer to the

552
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:35,919
the device or should we push it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a</font>

553
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:39,340
cloud for more centralized data

554
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:41,260
management and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer I don't know</font>

555
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,419
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a very good answer but the</font>

556
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">real answer we have right now at the</font>

557
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,750
moment is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are still trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

558
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:49,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so there are certain principles</font>

559
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,930
in terms of you know how you can look at

560
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:55,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">it for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example if you need real-time</font>

561
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:58,960
instantaneous response to m2m data or

562
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:01,630
any sort of data it makes more<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense to</font>

563
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,730
process it closer to the the device

564
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:07,060
itself right<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather than pushing it out</font>

565
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:09,880
to a centralized cloud however if you

566
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:12,970
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at doing more time series</font>

567
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,250
type of analysis which requires more

568
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:18,310
historical data over a period of time it

569
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,690
makes more sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it on the club so</font>

570
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:23,649
essentially there are certain broad

571
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:27,280
principles but how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually end up</font>

572
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:29,440
having a good mix of where to process

573
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:32,560
the data is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be defined by the</font>

574
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:36,580
use cases by the connectivity by the

575
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:41,590
ability of the things to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually store</font>

576
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:43,840
data be able to do some processing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

577
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:45,129
just heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> from one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> persons at</font>

578
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">qualcomm that they're you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

579
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:49,420
interested in looking at ways to add

580
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,250
some neural networks and artificial

581
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:53,110
intelligence at the chip level itself

582
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:55,750
where you could be doing some of the

583
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:57,610
local processing so given all those

584
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,980
advancements and the improved

585
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:02,919
connectivity that we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

586
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:04,720
it it's a decision that has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken</font>

587
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,590
based on use cases so tremendous

588
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,080
tremendous scope for innovation here

589
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,000
based on the advances in all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

590
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,960
in the hardware and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the connectivity</font>

591
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,660
space thank you that's very interesting

592
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,560
because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we've in India at least</font>

593
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:25,990
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> regulator's put out a</font>

594
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,270
consultation on cloud computing and very

595
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:30,690
often what

596
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:33,300
this for<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons of security you know we</font>

597
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:35,310
go and tie ourselves in knots and you

598
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,379
know one of the at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least from our side</font>

599
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:41,310
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we say is that it is imperative at</font>

600
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:43,620
least for us are people that a business

601
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:45,600
cannot come down so we put in the best

602
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:49,949
security measures that are there with

603
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:52,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I'll turn to you know Anand who's</font>

604
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:54,870
from tata communications so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't they</font>

605
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:59,450
tell us you know from m2m from whatever

606
00:26:54,870 --> 00:27:01,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">you heard my first poser to you is</font>

607
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:05,130
coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big business group</font>

608
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:08,520
yourself right so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be quite</font>

609
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:11,130
evident is that in the m2m I IOT space a

610
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:14,190
large<font color="#E5E5E5"> business house like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tartars</font>

611
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:17,130
themselves or maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> rely on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saw the</font>

612
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,940
builders so internal to your businesses

613
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:24,150
there would be a significant you know

614
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:25,890
potential for using m2m and IOT before

615
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,210
you go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look for other clients do</font>

616
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:30,020
you think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is scope that within</font>

617
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:34,080
business houses how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that</font>

618
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:36,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">Thanks I would start with data</font>

619
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,020
communications when we started kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

620
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:41,550
looking into em to msn Venus the odd the

621
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,710
whole tata group's there are a lot of

622
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:45,480
verticals and use cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> within m2m as</font>

623
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:47,430
well so we have approached all the tata

624
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,520
group's to kind of let us say asset

625
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:52,590
management asset tracking smart metering

626
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,090
there are lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> use cases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> within data</font>

627
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:56,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">grows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's a huge group that we can</font>

628
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:58,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of connect with from almost 100</font>

629
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,200
companies within<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tata itself to kind of</font>

630
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:05,610
reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and build a society which is</font>

631
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,200
directly connected on on implant doing

632
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:10,290
so what anyways we are teaching the

633
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,150
society with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the volumes of devices that</font>

634
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,920
we are talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that's easily</font>

635
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,680
accessible to data communication as a

636
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:22,170
communication organization to reach out

637
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:23,700
to this social locations where what my

638
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,830
colleague<font color="#CCCCCC"> said about reaching out to the</font>

639
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:29,430
remote locations we have a presence

640
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:31,439
order by virtue of tata group company

641
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:33,570
touching the lives of any<font color="#CCCCCC"> tata any</font>

642
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,720
people even in the rural location stats

643
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:38,850
a smart meter order will be connected so

644
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,270
with that as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a back side we started tata</font>

645
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:43,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">communications to venture into em too</font>

646
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:46,290
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> along with that something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

647
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:50,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to also convey on this forum</font>

648
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:53,639
would be like along the ISPs or the tsps

649
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:56,970
just don't give the pipe they give the

650
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,500
technology to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the society not just envy</font>

651
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:02,460
IOT there are lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other technologies</font>

652
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:04,200
which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> available on the forums on an</font>

653
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,510
licensed spectrum which is easily

654
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,520
accessible and ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be deployed so</font>

655
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:12,540
with that at the mindset we started with

656
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:16,310
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called Laura and we already</font>

657
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:18,990
deployed in more than three cities and

658
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:21,929
we will be kind of we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken up the</font>

659
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">march to kind of connect almost 100</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plus</font>

660
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:26,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">cities within next 18 months to kind of</font>

661
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,830
connect these devices with that that

662
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:31,380
sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting so is this lower</font>

663
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:33,929
deployment<font color="#E5E5E5"> being done by Tata</font>

664
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:37,350
Communications oh I it is in conjunction

665
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:39,330
with some TSP it is not a communication

666
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,760
who is doing the deployment that's

667
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:44,879
interesting so write your thoughts on

668
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:48,750
Laura<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus narrow band IOT you</font>

669
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,640
mentioned yeah yeah thanks I actually

670
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,970
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this is a really interesting</font>

671
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">point of discussion and maybe needs a</font>

672
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:59,310
you know much much more time even beyond

673
00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:00,750
what is possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> here right to be honest</font>

674
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:02,460
I myself haven't looked at all the

675
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,710
details of Laura to either to have an

676
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:08,370
idea at a high level right I think

677
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:10,080
overall our feeling is that you know

678
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:11,909
what what kind of cellular technologies

679
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,520
do bring to the table is worldwide

680
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:17,280
standardization right and that has a lot

681
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">of benefits right because you know</font>

682
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,580
because because there's so much

683
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:22,379
learnings from different networks that I

684
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,330
deployed across the world that then that

685
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,610
then feed back into the standardization

686
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:28,080
process and this kind of this continuous

687
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,370
improvement of<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font>

688
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,480
that right because there's many many

689
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:33,659
players around the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> who have a</font>

690
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,090
stake in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so and we've kind of</font>

691
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:38,670
seen this you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sort of</font>

692
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:40,080
before as well right that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

693
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,730
global<font color="#E5E5E5"> standards at least in the</font>

694
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,850
cellular industry we've seen you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

695
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:48,090
tend to be you know a very very strong

696
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:50,550
factor in in determining success of the

697
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,750
technology right other than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

698
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:54,010
know the other reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I touched upon</font>

699
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:56,380
earlier was was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that thing</font>

700
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:59,230
security and provisioning are are very

701
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:01,270
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do very very well baked into</font>

702
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:04,630
into standards and very well tested over

703
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:06,160
the years now a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data points I</font>

704
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:08,020
wanted to mention as well that at least

705
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are seeing in markets like the US and</font>

706
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:13,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">in Korea as well is that at least some</font>

707
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:17,500
of the some of the operators that we see

708
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:18,970
there who did try some other you know

709
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,970
technologies that were not globally

710
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:23,980
standardized in the past year<font color="#E5E5E5"> or couple</font>

711
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:25,600
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years have you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

712
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:29,230
to move towards cellular technologies

713
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,209
and I think part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the reason that I</font>

714
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:33,700
think cellular technologies were not so

715
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:36,820
much adopted maybe you know till about a

716
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:39,730
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years back was that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

717
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:41,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">there was not adequate progress till</font>

718
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:43,330
then on the definition of IOT

719
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,860
technologies within within cellular

720
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:46,149
standards but i think that's that's

721
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,490
changed a lot in the last couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

722
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:52,240
years and and changing very fast as we

723
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:54,700
speak so while<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wouldn't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to hazard</font>

724
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,250
a guess you know as to as to kind of

725
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,870
what wins out or not but but it is from

726
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,790
what we've seen you know global

727
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:03,219
standardization you know in general

728
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:05,129
proves to be a very powerful force right

729
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:07,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">because what really happens is that when</font>

730
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:09,880
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if a few operators start to</font>

731
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,830
deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> a technology then other operators</font>

732
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,420
who you know who also followed similar

733
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:15,429
standards in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they see</font>

734
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,690
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this operators doing this so</font>

735
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:18,550
maybe it's a good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to</font>

736
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">evaluate as well right so that kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

737
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:22,389
you know builds momentum upon itself

738
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,010
right so it's quite interesting i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

739
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,870
between various technologies and

740
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,430
technology options the question is

741
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:29,830
whether you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy it</font>

742
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:31,930
yourself or do you want to partner with

743
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:37,090
the existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> partner with the national</font>

744
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:40,480
footprint like big ISP or a telco so

745
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:42,370
that's some food for thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd like to</font>

746
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,900
check with you Tony how much time we

747
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:46,689
have more so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can take up</font>

748
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,310
questions from the floor<font color="#CCCCCC"> omaha 20</font>

749
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:52,330
minutes mom wonderful thank you so much

750
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:55,120
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice so with that I think you</font>

751
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:58,149
know one of the poses i have maybe is

752
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:04,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the government has put out a draft</font>

753
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:07,510
m2m you know guidelines<font color="#E5E5E5"> so one was the</font>

754
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:09,880
Department of Telecom put up the draft

755
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:13,060
guidelines and within that they've

756
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:16,300
referred to tre I for some consultations

757
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:21,580
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> any initial thoughts anybody would</font>

758
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:23,320
have on the m2m paper yes so the

759
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:26,830
consultation paper is<font color="#CCCCCC"> merely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a kind of</font>

760
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:29,620
related towards three big aspects one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

761
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:31,899
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> is spectrum which spectrums needs</font>

762
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,879
to be unlicensed for m2m operations

763
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:37,930
because as my colleague said even if it

764
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,490
is a standardized body and<font color="#E5E5E5"> B IOT it has</font>

765
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:42,070
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be about going on a licensed spectrum</font>

766
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:43,450
so but on a licensed spectrum and

767
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,790
looking at the volume<font color="#E5E5E5"> of devices that</font>

768
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:47,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> connected it would we feel</font>

769
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:50,170
that it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sustainable within a</font>

770
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:53,440
licensed spectrum so what government

771
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:56,850
feels like which unlicensed spectrum has

772
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,710
to be kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of D licensed for the m2m</font>

773
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:02,290
operations in India so that is one

774
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:05,170
aspect around it there are a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of</font>

775
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:08,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">was related to the roaming how to have a</font>

776
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:10,960
framework of rooming between a foreign

777
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:13,449
foreign say more like<font color="#E5E5E5"> international one</font>

778
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">country one nation roaming for devices</font>

779
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:17,799
and the third<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect of of which is like</font>

780
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:19,750
as my colleague covered it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

781
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,520
related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the security and the data</font>

782
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:25,179
privacy which we have not touched<font color="#E5E5E5"> pontil</font>

783
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">no data privacy is kind of something the</font>

784
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:28,270
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is going to be generated out</font>

785
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:32,110
of this millions of devices is going to

786
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:34,780
be humongous and each<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it is kind of</font>

787
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:36,540
private to on its own application so

788
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,950
that is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

789
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:42,159
detailed framework which needs to be put

790
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:44,949
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> regulation what in terms of data</font>

791
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,590
privacy not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a data security part of</font>

792
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:50,259
it like data privacy when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say it has</font>

793
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:52,480
to handle by the respective end user and

794
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,980
to the end consumer only that is

795
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,230
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been part of the</font>

796
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,900
interesting thank you so yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

797
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:02,770
at one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the sessions discussing the</font>

798
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:08,010
who is and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> icons approach</font>

799
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:10,840
to kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> revise or reform the who is</font>

800
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:12,850
process and maybe identify service

801
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,950
providers who provide that facility to

802
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:17,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> registrar's so what's interesting is</font>

803
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,689
that it is a contract between the icon

804
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,480
and the reg

805
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,950
drugs so my question<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them was you</font>

806
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,550
know what's the input from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GAC and</font>

807
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:31,609
I'm not sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether you know in the ISP</font>

808
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:34,369
CP community are there you know let's

809
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:36,799
say requirements from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> regulator's</font>

810
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:40,550
the government's on a more stringent who

811
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:43,490
is and is that being fed into the icon

812
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:45,470
as part of the is PCP community maybe

813
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:48,140
that's a question we can you know try

814
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:50,689
and address when we open up for

815
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:55,609
questions or if somebody from the ice

816
00:35:50,690 --> 00:36:00,520
PCP committee can elaborate on with that

817
00:35:55,609 --> 00:36:03,410
I'll request the floor for questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

818
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay let me start from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rear end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> subi</font>

819
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:07,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have your name so at the back please</font>

820
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:10,759
identify yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> pose the question and</font>

821
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:13,250
in case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to call up on the</font>

822
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:18,040
palate the JC after you later first at

823
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:18,040
the rear we could start yeah yeah nope

824
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:36,640
good morning everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Puma garage</font>

827
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:45,010
very important very critical paradox

828
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:47,529
that the amount which is collected

829
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:49,720
through a gr is just hundred curves

830
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:52,690
where is we are spending eighty thousand

831
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:56,439
Carew's on Bharat net from the

832
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:59,080
government so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> must have asked with</font>

the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> that why are you putting</font>

836
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:09,160
argument which government is giving back

to you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this AGR</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like to</font>

00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand that the government is saying</font>

839
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:16,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that nothing is free and this six</font>

840
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:18,850
percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> licence fee is our partnership</font>

841
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:22,020
fee which on the broadband should be

842
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:25,299
there without understanding key that

843
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:28,960
this is creating a cascading effect of

844
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:31,660
this eight percent AGR because we are

845
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">now we're getting the VAT benefit or the</font>

846
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:38,980
credit or the input credit of the

847
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:41,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">earlier paid each year so this is the</font>

848
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:44,530
cascading effect 100 crore what we are

849
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:47,560
calculated on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> event total revenue of</font>

850
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:53,260
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet services of the country</font>

851
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:55,810
especially by the ISPs so let's see that

852
00:37:53,260 --> 00:38:00,010
how the government be reacts because

853
00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:02,080
even at one time the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tra I has said that</font>

854
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:04,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Agia should be there but the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

855
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,730
end they are saying that at least five

856
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">years there should not be any easier on</font>

857
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:11,170
the fixed-line broadband so now they are

858
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:13,390
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> deciding factor and they</font>

859
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:15,610
themselves are confused because into the

860
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:18,460
last when mr. rakesh<font color="#CCCCCC"> gerg was the</font>

861
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:20,740
secretary of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> telecom secretary of</font>

862
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:24,010
the deity he also told<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that by</font>

863
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:26,200
imposing the AGR the broadband rate will

864
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:29,950
increase and the digital India program

865
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:32,140
will getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> derailed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you Rajesh</font>

866
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:34,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sharma you know what is going to happen</font>

867
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:36,370
is that and this is also for<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of the</font>

868
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,890
international participants today so

869
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:43,660
India is actually going through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

870
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:45,819
historical tax reform called the GST

871
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,649
so one of the things is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Indian</font>

872
00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:49,990
telecom and internet sectors<font color="#E5E5E5"> are already</font>

873
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:52,180
pretty highly taxed it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most</font>

874
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:54,279
highly taxed like you know sectors and

875
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,339
when you compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> it globally as well and</font>

876
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:01,210
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is set to increase so current you</font>

877
00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:03,339
know from fifteen percent what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

878
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,680
hearing at least at the CEO<font color="#E5E5E5"> is likely to</font>

879
00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:09,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">go up to 18 so overall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cost of</font>

880
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,819
telecom and internet service is set to

881
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,200
increase right so on one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand you say</font>

882
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:16,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay make it more affordable the other</font>

883
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:23,439
side you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hike the Texas okay</font>

884
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:26,589
brijesh see your question thank you

885
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:30,280
become the first thing is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> refer to</font>

886
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:33,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">just not GST this AGR i believe is over</font>

887
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:36,369
and above DST and if it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font>

888
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:38,170
part that could be one thing but my

889
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:42,130
question is on basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> on two counts</font>

890
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:43,900
one is to mr. Kapoor one time you

891
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:47,680
mentioned that you are expecting 10

892
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:49,450
years battery life for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT in the</font>

893
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,598
same breath you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying cellular both</font>

894
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:55,419
are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible cellular lasts i am</font>

895
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:58,839
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> serious cellular last four year</font>

896
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:01,210
four hours five hours and cellular has

897
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:03,279
got a range of mr. Vikram can say about

898
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:06,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">a kilometer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the base base station</font>

899
00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:10,510
radius of 500 meters to 700 meters which

900
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:13,150
is there now IOT device has to transmit

901
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:14,619
and most of the traffic I understand

902
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:17,410
he's from IOT of words is there

903
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:20,200
downwards is very little<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I utd ice</font>

904
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:22,118
has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send traffic upwards to 700</font>

905
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">meters and battery of 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years that's</font>

906
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">just not feasible so hence whether</font>

907
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:27,940
cellular will work for IOT is the

908
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:29,348
question to mr. Kapoor so interesting

909
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,660
questions so two things one is you

910
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:34,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the tax and the GST part</font>

911
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:38,259
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between the CI the spy and</font>

912
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:39,970
all associations we have we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to work</font>

913
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:43,210
harder because the train has left the

914
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:44,558
station is right the GST councils

915
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:46,720
already been meeting they're taking the

916
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:48,010
decisions it'll get implemented so all

917
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,240
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is pull up your socks and</font>

918
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">hike your prices I don't know what</font>

919
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,729
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do but that's what seems</font>

920
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:57,619
to be likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen okay gents are</font>

921
00:40:54,730 --> 00:41:01,279
whenever we talk to do tea

922
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:04,609
about this eight percent EGR they say

923
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:07,190
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a tax this is a fee and this</font>

924
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:09,440
is a partnership fee when we are giving

925
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:12,289
you the license we expect something from

926
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,440
you and it will be a different different

927
00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:17,420
slab for everybody whether already you

928
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">have paid or not paid is not concerned</font>

929
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,039
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are saying that yeah this is not a</font>

930
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:24,259
tax this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a fee and don't consider it</font>

931
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:25,579
is a text so that is why I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect</font>

932
00:41:24,259 --> 00:41:28,130
you that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> merged with the</font>

933
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:29,839
GSC great<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess both you guys</font>

934
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:33,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">considered luncheon you know dwell more</font>

935
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:35,779
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks that was a really good</font>

936
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:37,789
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let me see if I can you</font>

937
00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:42,109
know try to touch up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key points</font>

938
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:43,400
in you know in in in in a short time so

939
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:44,749
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our common</font>

940
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,839
experience of course is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

941
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:49,700
smartphones barely lasted a but I think

942
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,279
just few things to keep in mind you know

943
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:54,348
what really drives the the drainage of

944
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:56,150
battery on the phone today right are

945
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:58,519
things like you know applications that

946
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:00,499
are running all the time a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

947
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:02,808
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> video like YouTube and others for</font>

948
00:42:00,499 --> 00:42:04,189
example today a lot a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times for</font>

949
00:42:02,809 --> 00:42:06,470
people who are working for companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

950
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:08,210
organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's emails because most</font>

951
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:10,549
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us are getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many mail every few</font>

952
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:12,799
minutes for example so what all these

953
00:42:10,549 --> 00:42:15,079
things do is that they not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only do they</font>

954
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:18,049
wake up your your communications engine

955
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:20,059
on the phone but they also tend to kind

956
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:22,309
of make up your display now it displays

957
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:23,839
a huge consumer you know consumer of

958
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:25,640
battery actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> much larger typically</font>

959
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,950
than the communications engine right so

960
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,299
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of all these things coupled</font>

961
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:31,160
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> really that that's kind of</font>

962
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:32,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">driving the fact that you are you're you</font>

963
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,730
know typical smartphone battery

964
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:36,799
struggles to last a day right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now if you</font>

965
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:39,380
compare and contrast it with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT use</font>

966
00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:42,499
case right or at least some segments of

967
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:44,749
IOT use cases the water meter being one

968
00:42:42,499 --> 00:42:46,308
for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> which typically the only</font>

969
00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:48,200
thing it has to do is kind of maybe wake

970
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:50,119
up once a day or maybe once a few days

971
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,249
and send send out some few bytes of data

972
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:53,930
right it's a very different use case

973
00:42:52,249 --> 00:42:55,549
right there is no display there there is

974
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:59,749
no high-end video processing that's

975
00:42:55,549 --> 00:43:01,309
happening right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and and now the kind</font>

976
00:42:59,749 --> 00:43:03,379
of the optimizations that are being

977
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:05,359
brought into into standards into

978
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,160
cellular standards what they allow is

979
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,569
that the few bytes of data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

980
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,368
water meter has to send whenever it

981
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:10,980
wakes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do it in a very</font>

982
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:13,260
efficient

983
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,730
wait what that means is that you know

984
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,619
today if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart phones right</font>

985
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:19,070
because because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the fact that they</font>

986
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:21,570
have a lot of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exchange there's</font>

987
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:23,280
for want of a better word and elaborate

988
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:25,140
process to kind of bring them onto<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

989
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,970
network you know to make sure security

990
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:29,819
setup you know all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff right</font>

991
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:31,290
but we're all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> tech you know</font>

992
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:34,080
technical enhancements are going with

993
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:36,930
you know in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the NB IOT space is</font>

994
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,670
that all those let's say the signaling

995
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:40,319
signaling and the protocols required to

996
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:42,450
kind of allow these water meters to

997
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,400
enter the network they made<font color="#E5E5E5"> me been made</font>

998
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:46,529
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very simple right so there's very</font>

999
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,330
little data to exchange very little

1000
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:50,280
signaling to be done so what that does

1001
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:51,869
is it really reduces the amount of time

1002
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,060
that your your communications engine

1003
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:58,530
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be needs to be you know</font>

1004
00:43:54,060 --> 00:44:00,960
needs to be powered on right so kind of

1005
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:03,359
just to say one<font color="#CCCCCC"> more thing so we have of</font>

1006
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">course a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know till Taylor</font>

1007
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,830
Taylor you're back you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't</font>

1008
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,779
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have devices so we only had</font>

1009
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:11,700
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some lab lab measurements</font>

1010
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,859
and so on some analysis but now we also

1011
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,720
have devices that are capable of these

1012
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:17,430
types of features and even in field

1013
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,770
measurements these types of advantages

1014
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:21,779
and and devices lasting you know yours

1015
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:24,900
on in fact on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to double-a batteries</font>

1016
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:26,670
right that's kind of bearing out so so

1017
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,040
so yeah while it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds a little bit</font>

1018
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:30,869
surprising from you know compared with a

1019
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,670
practical experience of smartphones but

1020
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:34,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's really keep in mind it's really the</font>

1021
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,630
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the use cases are enormously</font>

1022
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:38,160
different right and as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the</font>

1023
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,840
form factors are enormously different

1024
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,850
you know there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> no high-end displays</font>

1025
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,260
there is no video processing right those

1026
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:47,819
types of things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really driving your</font>

1027
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:50,010
smartphone battery usage so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rohit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1028
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:52,230
just to add on to that I've seen

1029
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:54,810
situations where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're talking about a</font>

1030
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:57,330
smart hub at home that is able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gather</font>

1031
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:59,190
information from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> various meters one</font>

1032
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:01,770
of it which could be the water meter<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1033
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:04,859
other one could be other power so on and

1034
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:05,970
so forth so given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that situation you</font>

1035
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:09,359
don't really need to connect to a

1036
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:11,100
cellular tower directly but just<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect</font>

1037
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,580
to a hub at home which can in turn

1038
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:17,990
transmitted I'm assuming that would also

1039
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:20,640
help<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the power consumption right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1040
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:22,169
think what you think what will happen is

1041
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know likely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's going to be</font>

1042
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:27,300
different use cases in some use cases as

1043
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,950
as my colleague mentioned there's going

1044
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,510
to be some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an aggregator which</font>

1045
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:32,520
which aggregates all of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1046
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:34,020
ships it off to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network in other</font>

1047
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases there there's likely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

1048
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,720
direct connectivity so it's probably

1049
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:40,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a little bit use case</font>

please thank you so beach at three this

1053
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:56,070
year I um my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is to both Rohit</font>

1054
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,470
and to Anand we are speaking

1055
00:45:56,070 --> 00:46:00,930
specifically to end to him but this is a

1056
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:02,370
larger broader policy context question

1057
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:04,589
and the relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> that business</font>

1058
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:06,630
shares with government when we were

00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:14,040
data serenity localization and data

1062
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:16,919
privacy if we look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basic premise</font>

1063
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:19,830
of m2m data has to be international

resist the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet it's unlike telecom</font>

may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be helpful also locally driven of</font>

1088
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:16,410
course you know the point is that

1089
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:18,870
different governments will have

have started they are still open<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1093
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:28,799
taking inputs and hopefully they will

1094
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:33,290
factor in the industry or business

1095
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:36,510
inputs into what finally emerges as the

1096
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:37,840
m2m guidelines but yes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> acknowledge</font>

what you mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

they are articulated<font color="#E5E5E5"> presently and how</font>

1100
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:48,910
can we align with one m2m or

1101
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:52,720
international practices so that when you

1102

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll out services on the m2 my</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">OT platforms these are aligned with the</font>

international best practice so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know at</font>

00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:11,880
you seeing any challenges with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1109
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:11,880
current policy the way it stands the

1110
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:18,540
guideline continues to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data</font>

1111
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:22,180
has to terminate within India and

1112
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:24,730
looking at the use cases almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> we feel</font>

1113
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:26,680
85 to 90 percent of the use<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases will</font>

1114
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:30,130
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow those guidelines it</font>

1115
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:32,589
was the M term is not just kind of it

1116
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:34,480
has to create value the value cloud

1117

services<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also offered within Indian</font>

1118
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:40,990
premises so I we feel that almost eighty

1119
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:43,360
five percent or ninety percent of the

1120
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:48,029
cases we would be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of meet</font>

1121
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:48,030
those guidelines and address the market

<font color="#E5E5E5">exciting so I have our one question and</font>

also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a response to a question about the</font>

who is regulation so first a question on

1131
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:24,490
what is the state of ipv6 some

1133
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:29,529
example in case of Japan it's an area

00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:33,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is still not really being ready and</font>

1135
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:35,440
observed as a challenge so<font color="#E5E5E5"> our Japanese</font>

1136
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:37,780
government has published report this

1141
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:53,930
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is whether they</font>

00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:35,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">be progressing fine so there are revised</font>

1156
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:39,480
timelines to what was initially thought

1157
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:43,589
of and those have been modified so that

1158
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:45,329
the deployment progresses suitably thank

1159
00:50:43,589 --> 00:50:47,310
you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much that's excellent and it's</font>

to her being set and this is being

1162
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:53,549
recognized so on my comment about the

1163
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:56,520
who is is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I heard something</font>

1164
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:59,670
around who is and whether there has been

1165
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:04,140
any government on considering regulation

1166
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:05,609
around who is accuracy so um I I work

1167
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:08,310
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jay Penick which is a national</font>

internet register in Japan focusing on

1169
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:14,549
who is or for number resources but I

1170
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:17,130
think it's pretty much common for the

1171
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:19,619
names as well that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting our in</font>

1172
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:21,420
a time it's increasingly more important

1173
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:24,900
to collaborate with the law enforcement

1174
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:27,569
agencies<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah but at the same time it's</font>

1175
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:29,849
these policies should be bottom up not

1176
00:51:27,569 --> 00:51:32,250
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of like you know government</font>

1177
00:51:29,849 --> 00:51:35,040
making regulations so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example in the</font>

1178
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:37,380
name some community in i can now there

1179
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,720
are discussions around reviewing the new

1180
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:42,930
gto who is which hopefully would address

1181
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:46,140
the needs of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> law enforcement</font>

1182

1183
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:51,509
law enforcement agencies will jointly

1184
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:54,000
make proposal to each of the five

1185
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:56,220
regions are in the number resources

1186
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,079
community to come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1187
00:51:56,220 --> 00:52:01,200
would address their needs so this kind

1188
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,599
of encouraging the government that these

1189
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,149
processes are happening

1190
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:07,700
and make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> join in</font>

1191
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:10,009
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of existing processes I think</font>

1192
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:12,919
would be really important and hope that

1193
00:52:10,009 --> 00:52:15,529
the Indian community<font color="#CCCCCC"> can help us some</font>

1194
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:18,289
raise awareness within government in

1195
00:52:15,529 --> 00:52:21,109
India thank you and that's exactly the

1196
00:52:18,289 --> 00:52:23,450
point that one has in mind actually and

1197
00:52:21,109 --> 00:52:25,190
you know because from<font color="#E5E5E5"> sue I we are more</font>

be more active and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure they would</font>

1211

the policy development process as that

1217
00:53:13,369 --> 00:53:17,660
evolves then there's there's ample

opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that work</font>

1223
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:30,259
impacts are much broader community and

1224
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,180
it's important that our views are fed

1225

into that so we welcome your input as

1231
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:54,769
Nandita saying from voice and data so I

1232
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:57,618
heard from the panel that mobile and

1233
00:53:54,769 --> 00:54:02,479
Internet Tecna internet use end user

1234
00:53:57,619 --> 00:54:04,160
should not be mixed you need a

1235
00:54:02,479 --> 00:54:06,229
differentiation between customer

1236
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,538
education at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rural level for mobile</font>

1237
00:54:06,229 --> 00:54:13,759
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet uses what I heard is that</font>

1238
00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:16,190
correct I don't know what we've conveyed

1239
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:19,310
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> confused you but</font>

1240
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:21,349
or what I insist that predominantly the

1241
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:26,990
internet access will be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mobile</font>

1242
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:29,569
device right at least in most developing

1243
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:33,169
or not yet connected internet connected

1244
00:54:29,569 --> 00:54:34,940
areas so in terms of priority for

1245
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:37,369
business or for industry it will be

1246
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:40,400
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually get people connected</font>

1247
00:54:37,369 --> 00:54:42,800
up onto the internet or firstly get a

1248
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,660
phone in their hands for those who<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1249
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,099
have the phone mobile phone in the hands

1250
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:49,970
and once they have the mobile phone in

1251
00:54:46,099 --> 00:54:52,609
their hands encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to start</font>

1252
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:54,560
using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">follow-up question from the technology</font>

1255
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:00,290
convergence point of view what kind of

1256
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:02,479
convergence will we see in mobile and

1257
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:05,089
Internet technologies going further if

1258
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:09,170
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> share some thoughts on that so</font>

1259
00:55:05,089 --> 00:55:11,599
unen I don't know who's wrong button on

1260
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:16,010
this year sorry the gentleman<font color="#CCCCCC"> from mr.</font>

1261
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:18,589
Kapoor from Qualcomm yeah yes see em

1262
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:19,640
time is entirely different<font color="#E5E5E5"> gamut when</font>

1263
00:55:18,589 --> 00:55:20,869
you are talking about mobile and

1264
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet that will continue to be on a</font>

1265
00:55:20,869 --> 00:55:26,089
licensed spectrum only but emptor it

1266
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:27,740
opens up both unlicensed and licensed

1267
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:31,369
because there is no technology which

1268
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:33,828
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of defines that this has to be used</font>

1269
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:34,849
only only<font color="#E5E5E5"> for him to MF and this</font>

1270
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:38,180
technology should not be used for any

other this it is a liberal as technology

1272
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:43,220
what that's what I would say but on a

1273
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:45,319
lesson spectrum is where we feel this

1274
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:48,410
lot of going to think things are going

1278
00:55:53,420 --> 00:56:02,359

1279
00:55:56,089 --> 00:56:03,799
for deployments right you and I think

1280
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:06,680
that you asked a very good question

1281
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:08,630
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> convergence and you know one big</font>

1282
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:11,230
convergent strain that we certainly see

1283
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:13,250
is is at a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> high level you know</font>

1284
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:15,619
convergence of technologies across

1285
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:17,000
licensed and unlicensed so right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1286
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:19,480
what's happened what's happening is that

1287
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,890
there is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this realization that</font>

1288
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,839
that there are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are lots of</font>

1289
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:27,650
opportunities to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use unlicensed spectrum</font>

1290
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:29,630
in lot of interesting ways to kind of

1291
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:32,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">ins in some cases 22</font>

1292
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:33,710
add you know to whatever services<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1293
00:56:32,029 --> 00:56:35,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">license spectrum may be providing so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1294
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:37,039
think what you will see in the next few

1295
00:56:35,269 --> 00:56:39,769
years if I had to hazard a guess is is

1296
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:42,589
basically technologies is at a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> high</font>

1297
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:44,450
level kind of cellular Wi-Fi all of

1298
00:56:42,589 --> 00:56:46,549
these coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> together in some way to</font>

1299
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:48,348
address you know broad bandwidth needs

1300
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:50,390
right and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's going to be</font>

1301
00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:51,980
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1302
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:53,779
there are areas to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that I've covered</font>

1303
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:55,730
very well by cellular areas that have

1304
00:56:53,779 --> 00:56:57,380
covered very well by unlicensed or

1305
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:59,869
technologies that are deployed in

1306
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:01,519
unlicensed like Wi-Fi and yeah there's

1307
00:56:59,869 --> 00:57:04,460
going to be a some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of convergence</font>

1308
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:07,459
area I think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of scope for</font>

1309
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:10,250
both to co-exist is all that I'll say

1310
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:13,069
Asha one is it's a privilege to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have I</font>

1311
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:21,920
can board member amongst us and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1312
00:57:13,069 --> 00:57:23,779
her to ask a question as well first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1313
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,700
shall come to you later and that'll be

1314
00:57:23,779 --> 00:57:27,349
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last okay thank you very much Vikram</font>

1315
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:28,910
so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is thank you for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

1316
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:31,940
introduction so my name is Asha

1317
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:35,180
hemrajani and I'm on the ICANN board I

1318
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:36,799
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make two points versus I don't</font>

1319
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:40,669
want to comment on the who is because my

1320
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:44,240
colleagues Tony<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Zuma has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Izumi's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1321
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:46,220
have addressed that very nicely indeed i

1322
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:49,519
want to emphasize a little bit what Tony

1323
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:52,669
said about more participation from this

1324
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:55,490
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the world in the who is story I</font>

1325
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:58,069
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question actually that's</font>

1326
00:57:55,490 --> 00:58:00,410
not related to I can work but because

1327
00:57:58,069 --> 00:58:01,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a spectrum expert in myself</font>

1328
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:05,930
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted to understand from your</font>

1329
00:58:01,759 --> 00:58:08,569
perspectives about TV white space and

1330
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:10,430
the the use of non licensed or

1331
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:12,529
unlicensed spectrum in india i'm very

1332
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:16,368
curious to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that thank you let</font>

1333
00:58:12,529 --> 00:58:21,019
me dwell on that so firstly in<font color="#CCCCCC"> India it</font>

1334
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:24,400
is empty space it is not white space

1335
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:27,529
white space United's being spoken of but

1336
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,740
particularly for india for there's a

1337
00:58:27,529 --> 00:58:32,509
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting plum consulting report</font>

1338
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:37,250
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was done out on the broadcast band</font>

1339
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:41,569
on the TV band that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the 472 698 to be</font>

1340
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:43,550
specific and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that report it's also</font>

1341
00:58:41,569 --> 00:58:45,140
been covered which is being fairly well

1342
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:47,210
accepted by the Government of India

1343
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:50,450
between the Department of Telecom and

1344
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:54,830
the broadcast ministry they both aligned

1345
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:56,450
themselves and they agreed to try and

1346
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:59,930
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the names included in the footnotes</font>

1347
00:58:56,450 --> 00:59:04,939
of the WRC along with other countries

1348
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:06,140
like Mexico a<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. New Zealand you know</font>

1349
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:10,720
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the countries Australia I</font>

1350
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:15,020
guess the point is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this band</font>

1351
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:18,220
essentially it's a Wi-Fi it's 80<font color="#CCCCCC"> to dot</font>

1352
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:20,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">X X technology that's being put to use</font>

1353
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:22,250
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is would going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1354
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:26,270
provide the databases for the power as

1355
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:28,810
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as for the spectrum allocations so</font>

1356
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:30,650
some pilots have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> done in India and</font>

1357
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:33,650
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being examined by the</font>

1358
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:35,690
government so there is of course

1359
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:37,490
potential and you know the debate would

1360
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:39,200
be and my friend from Qualcomm I don't

1361
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:42,919
know if he's covering this part or not

1362
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:45,710
but yes we are in conversation with many

1363
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:50,080
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that if you had a hundred</font>

1364
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:52,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">megahertz worth in the sub gigahertz man</font>

1365
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:56,150
what is the kind of throughput you would

1366
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:58,669
achieve either using IMT or whichever

1367
00:59:56,150 --> 01:00:01,580
technology so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a comparison</font>

1368
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:05,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in a hundred megahertz available in</font>

1369
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:08,120
the very valuable uhf band what would be

1370
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:11,810
the best technology to put to use at

1371
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:14,900
what cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's the discussion that</font>

1372
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:17,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happening and you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as we go along</font>

1373
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:20,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sure the government will examine in</font>

1374
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:23,270
what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best manner or putting that</font>

1375
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:26,120
particular spectrum to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wonder if</font>

1376
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:29,380
that addresses thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right the</font>

1377
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,380
gentleman there please

1378
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:43,390
hi good morning to all my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kalyan</font>

1379
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,760
i am from stpi which is an isp india are

1380
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:49,720
there are any set of standards frame

1381
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:55,599
variety or<font color="#E5E5E5"> mtm or what is the status for</font>

1382
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:57,490
that standards for any<font color="#CCCCCC"> iot so honestly i</font>

1383
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:00,640
am not really aware what i am aware of

1384
01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:04,328
is that for m2m we are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to align</font>

1385
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:08,348
as much with<font color="#E5E5E5"> one m2m and there is some</font>

1386
01:01:04,329 --> 01:01:10,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">work at the TSD SI that if there is a</font>

1387
01:01:08,349 --> 01:01:14,109
india requirement that should be put

1388
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:16,930
into 12<font color="#E5E5E5"> m 1 m 2 m so that any standard</font>

1389
01:01:14,109 --> 01:01:21,519
is the global international standard

1390
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:28,058
that is followed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by india all right good</font>

1391
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:29,618
we've got experts in the house thanks

1392
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:31,569
for using this question this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very</font>

1393
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:34,349
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> question where we feel that</font>

1394
01:01:31,569 --> 01:01:36,819
the participation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> India in the</font>

1395
01:01:34,349 --> 01:01:40,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard making process with whether it</font>

1396
01:01:36,819 --> 01:01:44,230
is with IOT or even telecom is very very

1397
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:45,940
low<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so as far as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TS dsi what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vikram</font>

1398
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:47,470
mentioned that is the body which has

1399
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:49,990
been created with the help of c dot

1400
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:51,399
which is working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the standards but</font>

1401
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:53,529
the place where we should actually

1402
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:55,420
participate is internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering task</font>

1403
01:01:53,529 --> 01:01:56,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">force where there are a lot of work</font>

1404
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,829
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening on IOT</font>

1405
01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:01,599
standardization so that should be the

1406
01:01:59,829 --> 01:02:04,089
place where we should have very clear

1407
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:07,960
focus for participation thank you thank

1408

<font color="#CCCCCC">you i think with that i'll bring this</font>

1409
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:12,309
discussion to a close and it's a

1410
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:15,009
privilege and i want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin by</font>
