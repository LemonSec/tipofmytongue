00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,410
of the cross community working group on

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,360
framework principles for future

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,500
cross-community working groups thanks

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,330
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the time to speak to us today</font>

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,310
Becky<font color="#CCCCCC"> hi sir could you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take us through</font>

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the background to this initiative sure</font>

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:25,198
um we the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am a member of the CC NSO</font>

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">Council and for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many years SEC NSO has</font>

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:32,340
used this cross community working group

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:36,180
approach to resolve issues in advance of

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,000
policy development and we had gained

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,960
quite a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,690
and the gns have started using that the

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,739
approach as well until we collectively

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,910
decided it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good to look at</font>

17
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:53,070
across community working groups that had

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,989
worked really well and those that hadn't

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,059
worked quite so well and try to figure

20
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">out what the differences were and</font>

21
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,280
developed some best practices for CCW

22
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">G's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to increase the likelihood that they</font>

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,320
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be successful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the gns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> o council</font>

24
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,030
adopted the final framework and<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirteen</font>

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,029
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Victoria this year could you take us</font>

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,619
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top the key principles that</font>

27
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:19,409
contains in the final framework well

28
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:21,299
they're very commonsensical in a way the

29
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,570
most important thing is to actually

30
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:28,200
start by defining what you want to do

31
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:31,829
what your goals are what your output is

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,140
likely to be what the scope<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the topic</font>

33
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:38,100
is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will make decisions in the</font>

34
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:41,670
group going forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on that</font>

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:46,020
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter development but then all</font>

36
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the participating SOS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nacs can agree</font>

37
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,280
on can review and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then agree on that's</font>

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,020
the most important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide in</font>

39
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,990
advance what your what your goal is and

40
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,350
how you're going to operate and get

41
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,570
buy-in from everybody obviously more

42
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,149
recently

43
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:09,630
we've noted the need to actually think

44
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,070
about the kind of expenses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

45
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:15,480
support that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need and</font>

46
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:17,609
lay that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out in advance and then you</font>

47
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,940
know to have really clear working

48
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,820
methods that that get there the most

49
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,859
important thing though really is but is

50
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,660
the Charter is getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that charter</font>

51
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,030
right from the beginning so with both

52
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,980
the CCN som the gns<font color="#E5E5E5"> or now having</font>

53
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,330
adopted the final framework how do you

54
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the community will go by</font>

55
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,730
implementing and operationalizing with

56
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:42,590
well i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people are beginning</font>

57
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,459
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the outcome look at the final</font>

58
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:48,930
recommendations that have been adopted

59
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:53,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">and and then go back and look at ongoing</font>

60
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:58,080
CCW G's to see whether they've really

61
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,459
got that the points covered the the

62
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,380
recommendations are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not</font>

63
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,920
mandatory they're not written in stone

64
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:07,950
there's the need for flexibility because

65
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:12,119
every CCW<font color="#CCCCCC"> g is a little bit different</font>

66
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:14,339
the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that when</font>

67
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">people start talking about collective</font>

68
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,010
work they're going to have this

69
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,290
checklist to kind of think is this the

70
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,019
right vehicle is a CCW<font color="#CCCCCC"> G the right</font>

71
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,970
vehicle should we be having some kind of

72
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,959
birds of a feather discussion group

73
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:33,870
instead but this will serve<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

74
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,180
checklist to help people decide whether

75
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:39,670
the CCW<font color="#CCCCCC"> G is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right vehicle and then</font>

76
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:43,630
to sort of go about setting it up

77
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:47,019
and you know burying the application

78
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:50,200
where it makes sense to do that but it

79
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,520
really is a sort of a checklist well

80
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,470
thank you thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> see here's to the</font>

81
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,550
work of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CC WG and have a great week</font>

82
