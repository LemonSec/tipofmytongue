1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
it's been about<font color="#E5E5E5"> an hour since the 43rd</font>

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,899
public meeting of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICANN closed here in</font>

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,580
San Jose<font color="#E5E5E5"> Costa Rica I think it's safe to</font>

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,050
say that new generic top-level domains

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,210
again dominated many of the

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,340
conversations here at this meeting rod

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,859
how many registrants do you have right

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,119
now in the new generic top-level domain

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,740
registration system we have 290

10
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,410
registrations registered users in the

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,209
system as of mark 16th so that's parties

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,119
that have gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and registered</font>

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,308
themselves and been verified as users to

14
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,070
then submit applications for<font color="#CCCCCC"> strings</font>

15
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,019
subsequently rod you said that even

16
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations not applying for new</font>

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,239
generic top-level domains should pay

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,460
close attention during this process

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,480
during the application process why

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,350
should even non applicants pay attention

21
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,968
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure because there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

22

protections that have been built<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

23
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,989
the program for<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights holders such as</font>

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,850
their right to object to any string

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,390
that's applied for for any reason

26
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,489
whatsoever at no cost in the original

27
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,739
objections period in window so it's

28
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,479
important that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> parties watch if</font>

29
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,689
they're concerned that someone else

might use their name or their brand or

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,520
see if they have any concerns and if

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,830
they do then they can express those

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,460
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you tell us what that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> program is</font>

secondly what sort of interest are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

42
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,419
getting at this stage as we put the

applicant guidebook together and neared

44
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,689
the opening of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> window there was</font>

45
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,640
giving a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> about whether it be</font>

46
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,600
possible for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide assistance</font>

47
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,939
for applicants principally from

48

developing countries<font color="#CCCCCC"> but not necessarily</font>

49

but who may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have had the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> financial</font>

fee it's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that goes some distance</font>

but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has to be taken in the</font>

55
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,310
that in order for anyone to operate a

56
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,170
new registry the application fee of 185

57
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,240
thousand dollars is only one portion of

58
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:25,480
a significant budget that one has to

59
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,640
have and so our contribution to reduce

60
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,239
the 185 thousand to if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recall</font>

61
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,010
correctly about 47,000 is helpful but

62
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,140
not I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's going to</font>

63
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,970
stimulate a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people who are</font>

64
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:40,149
otherwise unable to get into the

65
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:42,070
business there's been quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

66
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,570
interest and part of what we've had to

67
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:49,000
do is to find people who can evaluate

68
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:52,090
and judge the appropriateness<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,490
application worthiness and we've not

70
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,620
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that ourselves we wanted to</font>

71
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">have independent people do that that's</font>

72
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,120
all very much in progress how is the

73
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,510
search for volunteers for that panel

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,190
coming we're in the process of

75
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,130
finalizing that at this time and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

76
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,320
will be ready and available to to go and

77
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,790
to support and to analyze the

78
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,980
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are received I also</font>

79
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,780
just want to note we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very encouraged</font>

80
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,030
there's a something called in-kind

81
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,040
contributions as well where any group in

82
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,320
the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> can offer products or services</font>

83
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,090
to support needy applicants and we have

84
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,799
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than a dozen parties that have</font>

85
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">already gone online and made offers to</font>

86
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,370
help whether it's with DNS SEC

87
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:35,110
consulting ipv6 with preparing their

88
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,519
technical plans are various things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

89
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,080
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very encouraged to see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

90
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,820
hope that more companies and

91
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,100
organizations will offer to do so as

92
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:45,010
well and they can offer that online at I

93
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,380
can you're looking for some fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> high</font>

94
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">level qualified people for this panel is</font>

95
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,700
it going to be tough to get those sorts

96
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,989
of candidates for the panel when you're

97
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,450
not paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> them when they're volunteers</font>

98
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:58,060
you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that we're very</font>

99
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">fortunate that I can draws upon a global</font>

100

<font color="#CCCCCC">community of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people interested in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

101
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,720
internet and I think there's a large

102
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,340
subset of those who care a lot about

103
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,500
needy applicants<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this cause so I</font>

104
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,390
would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> anticipate quite some</font>

105
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,860
number of excellent candidates coming

106
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,890
forward although I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at the</font>

107
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,680
the application list yet what's the

108
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,870
status right now of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> registrar</font>

109
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,780
accreditation agreement it's still under

110
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,660
negotiation and a document was published

111
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,289
in early March before this meeting there

112
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,690
were numerous

113
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,880
sessions at this meeting talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

114
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,410
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> where there were opinions in view</font>

115
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,060
shared a different constituency and

116
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,670
stakeholder meetings and other

117
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:40,510
discussions so i would say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

118
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:42,670
discussions are have gained for more

119
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:45,070
information here and hopefully will be

120
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">advancing with concrete results soon</font>

121
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,690
we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see let me ask you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question I</font>

122
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,490
asked you gentlemen in the car when we

123
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,580
did this interview and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has to do</font>

124
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,890
with batching first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all describe what</font>

125
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,840
batching is secondly tell me how far

126
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,940
we've come in that process since the car

127
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,710
as you as you're aware we have this

128
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,950
application window that opened in

129
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,810
January<font color="#E5E5E5"> and will close April twelfth we</font>

130
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,080
don't know how many applications will

131
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,270
come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> route is described the number of</font>

132
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,010
registered users but each<font color="#CCCCCC"> one can submit</font>

133
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,780
don't have been any that could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero</font>

134
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,969
or they could submit up to 50 so there's

135
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,700
a very very wide range<font color="#E5E5E5"> of potential</font>

136
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,470
applications and we're in the window

137
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">even for registering isn't done so we</font>

138
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:29,890
don't know the numbers we have very very

139
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,750
carefully sized the evaluation process

140
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,960
and the management<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the quality</font>

141
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:37,900
control to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle 500 at a</font>

142
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,940
time if we get more than 500 then we

143
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,460
have two segments them into what we call

144
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,710
batches and when the first batch is

145
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">through that process then we can start</font>

146
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,539
the second batch and so forth so the

147
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,180
this window is<font color="#E5E5E5"> open for what we call</font>

148
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,580

149
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,910
that round is broken up into batches of

150
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:02,919
500 is the is the what's on the table

151
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:05,320
the plan and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will will do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you've</font>

152
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,270
already said very definitively that

153
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,280
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a second round</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

154
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,859
applications following this first one

155
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,719
yes and you've also not specified when

156
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,660
it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> when might you be able to</font>

157
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,720
announce wind that second round

158
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,040
the excellent question so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we've</font>

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,320
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be clear that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

160
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,450
fundamentally two variables to two

161
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,030
factors that will influence when the

162
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,830
second round starts one is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many how</font>

163
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,450
big the first round<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if the first</font>

164
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,950
round has a large number of applications

165
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,990
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get through that before we</font>

166
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,360
can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the second round quite</font>

167
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:39,440
obviously the second factor<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

168
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've also committed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take a pause and</font>

169
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,910
examine how well the system has worked

170
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:47,460
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> every way Systems wise and in terms</font>

171
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:52,410
of the evaluation<font color="#CCCCCC"> process and all of</font>

172
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:54,960
that so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't pin down a date certain</font>

173
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,400
but we can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> rough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> estimates and the</font>

174
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,229
first part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the rough estimate will</font>

175
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,770
depend as i said on how big the round

176
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:04,020
this when we know how many applications

177
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,490
are and that will be within a relatively

178
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,530
short period<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time after the</font>

179
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,420
application window closes then that

180
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:12,270
factor will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be relatively pinned down</font>

181
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:14,550
whichever and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make you know</font>

182
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:17,909
a rough estimate of the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time</font>

183
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,710
necessary between rounds not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font>

184
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:23,220
commitment but we can you know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

185
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:25,530
give a window and contingencies what

186
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,290
does all that mean it's it's it's time

187
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,940
measured from here in years but not a

188
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,350
large number of years you know it's

189
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably a small number of years the</font>

190
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,790
night and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't pin it down greater</font>

191
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">than that because we're running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

192
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,210
experiment this meeting occurred in the

193
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,590
wake of an announcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the</font>

194
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,710
Department of Commerce that it was

195
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:45,810
rewriting the request for proposals for

196
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,900
the iono function what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mean</font>

197
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">for I can it means that next week we'll</font>

198
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,739
be sitting down and having a

199
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:54,930
conversation with<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA to understand how</font>

200
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,850
they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this point and what's the</font>

201
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,130
roadmap that they see going forward and

202
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,320
we're also pleased last week that we did

203
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:03,360
sign a modification to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> agreement</font>

204
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,700
that extends the period for next another

205
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,800
six months while we have those

206
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,690
discussions<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stephen December there's</font>

207
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,730
going to be a meeting of the ITU and

208
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,490
Dubai which some have characterized as a

209
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,510
potential threat to I can what is this

210
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,940
meeting mean

211
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:20,640
for I can certainly it's it's a concern

212
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that has been expressed I don't want to</font>

213
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,490
comment on what might happen or what

214
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:29,540
might not happen but it's certainly in

215
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:33,390
the air and getting a lot of discussion

216
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:37,260
the ITU is a venerable institution been

217
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:41,970
around for 100 200 years and has played

218
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:44,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">a very important role and one of the</font>

219
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:47,790
challenges that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet has posed</font>

220
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:51,000
in many many spheres including the

221
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:54,390
regulatory sphere is what how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

222
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,910
adjust<font color="#E5E5E5"> the institutions that have were</font>

223
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:59,280
created before to operate in this new

224
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:02,490
world and so it's quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> understandable</font>

225
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,380
that the ITU is quite interested in this

226
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,360
and it's quite understandable that where

227
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,189
the in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet community quite</font>

228
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,350
interested in how the ITU thinks about

229
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,140
things in discussing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

230
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,270
conflict of interests and ethics you

231
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,680
mentioned that i can was hiring three

232
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">new consultants what do you hope to</font>

233
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:23,609
achieve with these new hires sure well

234
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:25,920
the board approved a plan for working on

235
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,600
conflict of interest issues and one part

236
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that plan was to hire external</font>

237
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,220
experts so we scanned the world to try

238
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to find some of the best experts in</font>

the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very fortunate to</font>

240
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,150
connect with German Brooks and his group

241
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:41,850
they'll be reviewing the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> of conduct</font>

242
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:45,000
and bylaws and other aspects<font color="#CCCCCC"> of I can</font>

243
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,650
and in our performance and living up to

244
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,120
those two to help us get I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

245
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,069
objective benchmarking of how we're

246
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,500
doing and where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to focus going</font>

forward Steve where are you at<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms</font>

248
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,570
of finding a successor for rod as CEO

249
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,850
search process is well<font color="#E5E5E5"> underway we had a</font>

250
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:03,450
report today from George<font color="#CCCCCC"> sadowsky who is</font>

251
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:06,570
chairing that committee rod very

252
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:10,280
graciously announced in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mid August that</font>

253
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:16,460
he would continue his through his tenure

254
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:18,319
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two July first and gave us a very</font>

255
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,480
good amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

256
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,880
to do an orderly search process we

257
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,880
advertised we communicated with the

258
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,560
community we laid out what criteria we

259
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,830
thought was appropriate we took feedback

260
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:33,319
on that way engaged a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> high quality</font>

261
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:36,220
search firm and we formed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a committee</font>

262
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,870
within the board to oversee that process

263
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,600
we have received a large number of

264
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,850
applications and we have narrowed that

265
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,360
and narrow that and wearing that process

266
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:49,550
we are keeping extremely close control

267
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,040
over the specifics out of concern for

268
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the privacy of the individuals who</font>

269
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,620
applied so I'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give numbers</font>

270
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:59,050
or names but it's moving on schedule and

271
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,040
it's in it's moving along quite well

272
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,229
bottom line when will you make the

273
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,490
announcement well there's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

274
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:09,140
certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of uncertainty about how</font>

275
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:10,850
the details yet but hopefully you know

276
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,370
on the somewhere in the May time frame

277
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:15,650
probably give or take let me ask both of

278
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:18,680
you gentlemen this question looking back

279
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:21,380
at the past week in this meeting here in

280

<font color="#E5E5E5">San Jose Costa Rica what stands out in</font>

your mind a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of highlights first I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">thought that sunyata President does</font>

speech Laura Chinchilla was just

284
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,590
exceptional and we were honored to have

287
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,300
visionary view of the Internet where

<font color="#CCCCCC">it's common where it needs to go so it</font>

289
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:46,310
was really just just amazing to see such

290
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,470
a powerful and elegant leader really

291

00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,250
had a president<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that in their</font>

296
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">country so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> positive for me</font>

297
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,470
the second highlight was probably the

298
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:06,500
signing of some letters of exchange with

299
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:08,810

with the l root system where they're

going to support multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> instances</font>

303
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:18,710
across the region and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that signals are</font>

304
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:21,530
really warm and welcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> a partnership</font>

305
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:23,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a very important international body</font>

306
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:27,220
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> nick the regional</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> registry here so</font>

307
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,949
those are the two highlights<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

308
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:33,350
challenging question because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

309
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:36,109
highlights across the board but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

310
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:40,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to agree that President</font>

311
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:41,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">shakyas speech was moving for those of</font>

312
00:12:40,189 --> 00:12:44,029
us who have heard many speeches and been

313
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,680
around a lot that speech stands out i

314
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:48,170
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate it not just as an excellent</font>

315
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">speech but a historic one that one that</font>

316
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:55,099
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be referenced and serve as a high</font>

317
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:58,999
water mark for some time to come in

318
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:01,339
addition the the points that rod is made

319
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:03,350
are right a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that stand</font>

320
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:05,990
out in my mind this was there was a

321
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:09,800
regional summit of the Latin American

322
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:12,980
Caribbean regional at large organization

323
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:16,209
lack Rallo and there was a comparable

324
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:21,559
meeting of African gac members and

325
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:24,199
at-large members here in in San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jose</font>

326
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:26,649
following up on a similar summit<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

327
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:31,300
they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> into car so both of those are</font>

328
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:36,620
tremendously important organizational

329
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:40,758
cohesion type events and really signal a

330
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:44,000
maturation in the growth within the

331
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:45,829
regions of awareness and cooperation and

332
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,660
from an<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can point of view</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are just</font>

333
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:52,160
tremendous that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of it</font>

334
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:54,350
there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was more quite a lot of</font>

335
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:59,529
progress on the things you talked about

<font color="#E5E5E5">on the ra a conflict of interest of</font>

00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:05,480
hard-hitting very specific kinds of

00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:08,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">things a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of focus on who is which</font>

339
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,629
has been a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a long time and a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really quite superior panel showing a</font>

lot of the details and bringing people

342

together than and i'm sure i'm

343

forgetting several there's a lot yeah

344
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:22,129
there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of what one of the most</font>

345

<font color="#E5E5E5">impressive things is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's hard to</font>

346
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:25,699
pick things because everywhere you go

347
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:27,740
there's an extraordinary amount of

348
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,389
action it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a rich community with</font>

also when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a lot of</font>

351
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:33,800
healthy discussion and debate on the

352
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:36,410
conflict of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest issues this week</font>

353
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,300
following on some of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> remarks and a</font>

354
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,500
lot of reaction<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that and and I saw</font>

355
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">that come in a lot of the sessions</font>

356
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,080
people talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about balance and what's</font>

357
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:45,110
the right way to do things

358
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,520
and I certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope and I feel that</font>

359
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,610
that does help to move the conversation

360
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,260
forward so it's very encouraging to see

361
