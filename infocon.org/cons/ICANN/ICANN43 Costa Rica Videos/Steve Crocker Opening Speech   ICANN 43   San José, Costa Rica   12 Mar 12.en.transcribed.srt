59
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:32,670
possibility that emerged from the very

60
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:34,799
same work was a tradition of openness we

61
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:38,700
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortunate for a variety of reasons</font>

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,520
that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was natural to those of us</font>

63
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,910
working on the network at the time to

64
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:48,810
feel a sense of camaraderie instead of

65
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:52,200
competitiveness and to welcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

66
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,180
participation of others and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sense</font>

67
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,540
of openness also played out in the

68
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:01,290
technical thinking that we understood

69
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,420
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could not anticipate all of the</font>

70
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,440
uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this technology would bring</font>

71
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:09,510
that it was not our job to prescribe

72
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,030
exactly how things<font color="#E5E5E5"> were going to be used</font>

73
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:16,409
and therefore an absolutely central

74
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:20,760
focus was to leave room for others to

75
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:25,500
build their ideas on so the architecture

76
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the original</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network was open the</font>

77
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,840
structure was

78
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:34,260
modular and<font color="#E5E5E5"> granular very small parts</font>

79
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,060
layers as we call them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fully</font>

80
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,730
expected that there would be new

81
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,070
services new ideas ones that we may or

82
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,590
may not have anticipated we had some

83
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:46,650
idea of what might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible and what</font>

84
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:49,169
would come but we also understood that

85
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:52,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">it would be foolish for us to insist</font>

86
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:54,690
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our views or our expectations would</font>

be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only way that things would happen</font>

88
00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:00,300
and so it came to pass that the world

inclined to ask me so how many have come
