I'm rod Beckstrom president and CEO of I

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,130
can I will interpret your attendance

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,440
here as an expression of your interest

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,809
in and a better understanding of what I

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,719
can is doing on behalf of the world's

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,880
two billion users of the internet and in

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,770
our function with a domain name system

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,169
from what I've seen during my several

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,140
days here in San<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jose that interest</font>

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,210
extends across costa rica by the close

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,960
of our pre-registration for this meeting

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,780
on Friday more than 1,700 participants

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,690
had signed up to attend including more

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,090
than 600 right here from right here in

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">Costa Rica and I think the president's</font>

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,129
statement that this event<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a public</font>

17
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,860
interest of Costa Rica certainly helped

18
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:50,670
these attendance figures and we see many

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,289
more registering this morning and that

20
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,090
interest of course extends all the way

21
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,309
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the president to president Qin Jia</font>

morning at the welcoming ceremony she's

24
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,090
developed exceptional understanding of

25
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,810
the complex issues that we had I can

26
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,240
discuss and debate every day it was a

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">very impressive presentation on that I</font>

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,600
believe our ranks among the very best

29
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,460
ever delivered at an icann meeting as I

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">said many of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these issues are complex</font>

31
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,899
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome the opportunity we welcome</font>

32
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,960

your questions hi guys um Kevin Murphy

35
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,350
domain insight on the register I was

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could explain</font>

37
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,289
specifically why icons responds to the

38
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,020
ionic contract RFP was not deemed

39
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,180
adequate and if there's some reason you

40
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,699
can't explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could you tell us why</font>

41
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,590
you can't explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think as you</font>

42
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the rules of bidding for the</font>

00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:26,680
here when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were making a presentation</font>

52
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:30,640
sir you are report precisely you you

53
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:34,830
told us<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the icon door a small</font>

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:50,760
introduced a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD are we looking at</font>

57
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:53,320
increasing the workforce or is icon been

58
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:58,200
really pinched<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the number of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">workforce he has presently and then</font>

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,640
secondly you also made mention of

61
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:09,540
pressures on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization</font>

62
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:15,399
politically ethically financially and

63
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:17,590
operationalize<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

64
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,530
precisely I cannot produce we are

65
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:23,670
getting is it from the government or is

66
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,780
it from organized interest organization

67
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,820
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to throw more light on that</font>

68
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,959
thank you on the first question with

69
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:35,140
respect to size we will add additional

70
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:39,610
headcount to the organization modestly

71
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:42,630
to support the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD program</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

72
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:46,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in the current plans for example</font>

73
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:50,230
exact headcount numbers around 130 738

74
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:53,920
right now with roughly 17 open positions

75
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:58,290
that were hiring but most of the new

76
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:02,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">gTLD work will be handled by out sourced</font>

77
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:05,019
application processors and panels that

78
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:07,720
make decisions on objections for example

79
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:10,510
so very little<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the hiring is done</font>

80
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,000
inside of i can because it's a temporary

81
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:16,120
program or it is a has a certain

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,519
duration and length so it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font>

83
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,070
appropriate to add all the headcount to

84
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,820
I can to handle the application

85
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,170
programming but i think that

86
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:30,070
historically the domain name

87
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:33,730
story has continued to grow and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can is</font>

88
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:37,810
a nonprofit organization but derives

89
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:40,240
most of its support from fees from

90
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,880
domain name registries in the generic

91
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,720
top-level domain space such as dot-com

92
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,750
net org registrations also from

93
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,320
registrar's in the generic space so that

94
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:56,110
continues to grow every year so I as i

95
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,730
shared recently with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> members of the</font>

96
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,310
board<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's a very reasonable</font>

97
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:03,910
forecast that the minimum number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

98
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:06,520
employees likely in a few years out is

99
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:09,700
200 and the number could could certainly

100
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,669
be higher depending upon how large the

101
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,370
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld program is and how many new</font>

102
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:17,740
top-level domains come into the root of

103
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,770
the internet and also depending upon the

104
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,040
organic growth in domain name

105
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:26,440
registration fees that's on your first

106
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:31,660
oh yes sir like yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a further I</font>

109
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:42,550
some agitations that I come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

operating question so I'll answer that

oh okay go ahead and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then have you</font>

respect to the general pressures you

121
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,159
mentioned I can faces and always has

122
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,960
space pressures from many different

123
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,920
constituencies and communities all over

124
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,780
the world because decisions do have to

125
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,210
get made at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day for</font>

example about whether a top-level domain

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,960
has entered into the internet or whether

128
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,230
there's a read Ella<font color="#CCCCCC"> gation made</font>

129
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,419
somewhere in the world and over policy

130
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,280
discussions and

dates or contract discussions and

132
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,559
debates such as we see with the

00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,690
registrar accreditation agreement this

134
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,510
week that's been a negotiation or

135
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:54,690
discussion ongoing intensively since our

136
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,969
meeting in Dakar last fall and and

137
00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:00,810
there's many different parties that have

138
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:03,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">very strong and differing opinions on</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a topic so there's I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

140

exist under what I call a crucible of

00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:11,670
tectonic pressures and pressures from

142
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,150
many different groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the world</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that have an interest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the domain name</font>

144
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:22,859
system because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> touches so much of the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">world today but and so the operations</font>

146
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,600
have to run independently of that and

147
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,840
run fairly and support the stakeholder

148
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,630
discussions and debates but remain fair

149
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,659
and impartial and accurately follow the

there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing specific to say</font>

there's no quick answers here it just

00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:05,470
takes a while to engage parties have

00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:14,310
and that is that we were informed that

<font color="#E5E5E5">NTA was not moving ahead with a</font>

any information that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're allowed to</font>

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my comments on that I cannot</font>

208
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,570
comment about your question on the line

209
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:50,120
about whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

210
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:55,150
submitted another bit no comment on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

211
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:58,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now and then your second question</font>

212
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:01,069
I'm sorry can you remind me again this

213
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,410
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had it had to do with the number</font>

214
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:06,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">of applicants piercing that's our with</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD okay thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the reminder</font>

216
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:13,970
yes so the application process has a

217
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">two-step process you first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

218
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:20,510
register as an applicant to be

219
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:23,090
identified<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system and to be</font>

approved<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an as a valid applicant with</font>

221
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:28,490
some verification before we move to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

222
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:32,030
next step of allowing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to file</font>

223
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:34,670
specific applications for Strings so the

224
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:37,250
first stage is basically to verify<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

225
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:40,280
institution who you are and to have that

00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:42,770
recognize the second stage is a specific

227
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,990
applications for Strings the number that

228
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:47,960
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented is the number of</font>

229
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:50,480
parties that have registered<font color="#CCCCCC"> themselves</font>

230
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:53,960
in the system and each of those

231
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,590
registrations is allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

232
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,960

00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,130
clarification that you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to offer</font>

235
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,350
to that and another fact for the

00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,420
gentleman from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nigeria I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to share</font>

that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> correct and individual parties</font>

254
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,410
can actually do I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> separate</font>

application so so it may be less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for what on the first is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that right yes</font>

262
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:23,000
that that is the target date that we

that if you if you have in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

266
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:35,689
the math<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multiply to 54 x 50 to get</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> maximum upper bound you should also</font>

268
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:41,210
multiply to 54 x 0 to get the minimum

269
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:44,150
lower bound no requirement for anybody

270
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:46,580
to actually submit a application<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

271
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:48,740
because they're registered so the full

00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,500
range is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 to whatever number you want</font>

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,870
implementation details and what had been

293
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,939
policy details with the community and

294
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:59,120
we're then going to move into

295
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:02,540
application processing and given the

296
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,820
tremendous potential value of some of

297
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,130
those strings we needed to start

298
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,850
separating more clearly the activities

299
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:12,360
of board community and staff on an

300
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,149
ethics basis to

301
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,890
conflicts because discussions that may

302
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:18,990
have been appropriate with say an

303
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,689
applicant who is going to apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> for new</font>

304
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:24,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">gtld that discussion may have been</font>

305
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,709
appropriate before the final program was

306
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,439
approved as a part of the

307
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:31,260
multi-stakeholder process but as soon as

308
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,810
we move to processing applications we

309
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,870
need to keep a very clean line<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

310
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:40,050
separation between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the staff and new</font>

312
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:45,180
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> was handled fairly and</font>

313
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:48,200
objectively and so what I had foreseen

314
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:51,870
was increasing pressures on us and

315
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,820
increasing calls for us to manage that

316
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:57,630
that I thought would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming and they</font>

317
00:15:53,820 --> 00:16:00,470
did in fact come the board embraced this

318
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:03,839
and the board picked this up

319
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:07,700
wholeheartedly in the board governance

320
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:11,100
committee and they approved a staff

321
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:14,850
recommendation to make significant

322
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:17,790

and provide us with inputs on the

supported that they established a budget

involve people within the community and

378
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:10,850
to deal with conflicts first and

on that number of applications received

so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> Huntley the only data that we're</font>

publishing about the application process

at this time is a number of parties that

register in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system which is 254 I</font>

can tell you that they come from

402
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,689
multiple geographies but we're not

403

giving any breakdown and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

discussing any specific names or strings

405

or terms we will publish all those for

the world to see openly and

407
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:36,889
transparently with the name of the

408
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:40,250
applicants as well and the target date

409
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:42,350
for that release is made of first hi

410
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,600
Garry McCarthy here from next with

411
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:47,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">respect to that could you explain what</font>

412
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,669
the rationale is that you will not

413
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,490
provide what would be really useful

414
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:56,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">statistics ie how many actual</font>

415
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:59,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications there are what category</font>

416
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:02,030
they fit in what is the rationale to not

417
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:04,040
provide that information<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously we</font>

418
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,139
want to protect protect the identities

419
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,260
of the applicants we don't want to get

420
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,970
into disclosing the strings themselves

421
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,129
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some discussion on</font>

422
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:15,880
the inside and one of the reasons we're

423
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:18,500
not publishing the number of specific

424
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,330
applications for the strings is we

425
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:24,620
neither wanted to be seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

426
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:27,169
encouraging nor discouraging parties to

427
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:29,600
apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> for new gTLDs that's really should</font>

428
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:32,390
be an independent decision based on

429
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,809
their view of what's what adds value to

430
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:39,580
their their own organization

431
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:43,210
and so that's number one number two we

432
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:45,580
also felt that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very likely that</font>

433
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,200
many of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications might come in</font>

434
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,230
towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the period or at</font>

435
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,090
least that's what parties had told us so

436
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,940
even if we were to publish the number of

437
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:56,799
strings applied for right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> or those</font>

438
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:00,490
individual applications it might not be

439
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,799
a very meaningful number I sort of feel

440
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,679
obliged to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give the the counter-argument</font>

441
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:08,679

<font color="#E5E5E5">being transparent and accountable so if</font>

the reason to not provide what would be

00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,509
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful information is that it may</font>

456
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:46,508
not paid until the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end so it's not clear</font>

457
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,580
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really an application for a</font>

00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,570

00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,850
will be towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the window</font>

461
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,710
whereas with the registrations for the

00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,389
individual entities I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

463
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,460
there's a there's a small upfront fee

464
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:02,889
that's paid if<font color="#E5E5E5"> five is it five thousand</font>

465
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,799
dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> akram yes of five thousand</font>

466
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:08,678
dollars so it so it's a little bit

467
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:13,059
different in terms of what what the data

468
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:15,399
might represent we have an online

on what future measures the board will

consider in improving ethics and

conflicts of interest situations we're

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a session during this week</font>

on what the state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> affairs is what</font>

we're considering I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to</font>

478
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:47,639
get ahead of that as I've already said

479
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:49,380
we take this very seriously we I don't

480
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,580
know how well<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's appreciated how</font>

481
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:59,570
strong the conflict of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rules</font>

482
00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:02,460
and execution of those rules adherence

483
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:07,289
had been in place and has been in place

484
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:09,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">for for many years every director is</font>

a conflict of<font color="#CCCCCC"> interest statement that is</font>

487
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:21,899
reasonably comprehensive and those are

488
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:25,200
on file they're reviewed by appropriate

489
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:29,820
people balancing privacy of the process

490
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:34,380
with a thorough examination and as I

491
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:36,210
also had said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one of the ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

actual conflicts are on the record

497
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:56,549
visible and and then we avoid you know

<font color="#E5E5E5">big obvious problems we don't put you</font>

499
00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:02,039
know Bruce Tonkin is our primary

500
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:04,320
exemplar of somebody who is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the industry handles himself with</font>

502
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:11,158
incredible grace and skill and has never

00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:14,100
tried to use his position<font color="#E5E5E5"> to influence</font>

anything and is first to remove himself

505
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:22,949
from any conversation if there's an

506
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:25,950
issue we expect and we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say a</font>

507
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:28,320
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very high level of behavior best</font>

508
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,659
behavior from people so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that said I</font>

509
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very strong base that</font>

510
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:36,090
we're working from and then given the

511
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,220
heightened concern we're not at all

512
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:41,459
afraid to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back and see if there's</font>

513
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:43,510
other things that we might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

514
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:49,660
and

515
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:51,890
we are open<font color="#CCCCCC"> to suggestions but we also</font>

516
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,990
try not to spend all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our time</font>

517
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:57,530
worrying about this that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get</font>

518
00:25:53,990 --> 00:26:00,890
some work done and just building on you

519
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:03,379
know Steve's good words there the board

520
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:05,470
created a subcommittee under the board

521
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:09,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">Governance Committee this last year</font>

522
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:11,600
specifically on conflicts and ethics so

523
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:14,660
it's a conflicts and ethics subcommittee

524
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:18,830
and all of the board members on that

525
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:21,740
committee are non conflicted and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

526
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:25,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was a important and valuable step</font>

527
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:28,190
that the board took<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kevin Murphy again</font>

528
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:30,470
well you mentioned earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> that icons</font>

529
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,970
expecting a great many applications to

530
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:36,830
be filed towards the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the window</font>

531
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:39,980
and what I gather<font color="#E5E5E5"> love these will be</font>

532
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:41,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">dull brand applications and a lot of</font>

533
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were waiting until the last minute</font>

534
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,460
to kind of pull the trigger on these

535
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:48,919
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was obviously a limited</font>

536
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,690
number of application consultants and

537
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,460
registries out there they're probably

538
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:55,250
facing this kind of end of window

539
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:58,670
bottleneck of to process these

540
00:26:55,250 --> 00:27:01,430
applications for the deadline meanwhile

541
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:04,310
icons also got a timing issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

542
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:06,560
olympic /<font color="#CCCCCC"> Red Cross issue I was</font>

543
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,669
wondering those two things in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

544
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,440
any is there any chance that the

545
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:12,440
application window will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be extended or</font>

546
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the March 29 and April 12 dates say</font>

547
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,940
installment we're not specifically

548
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,770
forecasting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the applications will</font>

549
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,800
come last minute because we're not

550
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:24,710
forecasting behavioral patterns or

551
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,960
specific numbers but we do hear from

552
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:29,390
different community members that they

553
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,690
anticipate that so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a</font>

554
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:36,650
reflection of what we hear then of any

555
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:39,020
decision-making process on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> part I</font>

556
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:41,420
can say at the present time and Steve

557
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:44,780
can can further clarify but certainly

558
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:46,820
the executive in my role CEO I would

559
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,820
never extend the application window

560
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:51,560
without a decision from the board and my

561
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,649
sense is you know quite clearly the

562
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,389
board is not moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that direction</font>

563
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:58,690
right now that's really for speak Steve

564
00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:01,360
to to speak to so at the present time we

565
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:04,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">firmly intend to close the application</font>

566
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,969
window on April twelfth and we presently

567
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:10,360
intend to announce the strings on May

568
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:12,940
the first and with respect to the IOC

569
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">and Red Cross issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve can fill us</font>

570
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,600
in there as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a healthy</font>

571
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,950
discussion with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gso council</font>

00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,610
yesterday and but those are ongoing

573
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:24,010
discussions this week Steve yeah I'll

574
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:26,639
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> come in on the on the first part of</font>

575
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:32,560
it lots of work has gone into

576
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:35,590
preparation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this process rod and his</font>

577
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:39,310
team have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of work have made</font>

578
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:41,709
very thorough presentations to the board

579
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:47,200
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> board has approved the plan that's</font>

580
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:51,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">in place and have no interest in</font>

581
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,460
second-guessing in fact we're completely

582
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:58,668
supportive of the whole

583
00:28:53,460 --> 00:29:02,850
process is the general principle once

584
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:07,679
you commit<font color="#E5E5E5"> to putting a plan in place</font>

585
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:09,178
and executing it every argument that

586
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,529
says well we got you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what about</font>

has to be looked at in the light of and

589
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,059
who would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be displaced if you undid the</font>

plan that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the place because the awful</font>

593
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:34,620
any indication that there's a sufficient

594
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:39,059
reason to change the schedule queries

595
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:42,029
come once a from from a few sources we

596
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:45,210
have no proposal that we are actively

597
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:47,640
working on that would cause that to be

598
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:50,580
changed at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment we continue to be</font>

599
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:54,390
open to receiving communications and

600
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:56,820
will be responsive to them but i think

601
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:59,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the message ought to be understood</font>

602
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:04,500
that the application window will close

603
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:08,970
April twelfth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> May first I believe is</font>

604
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,919
the intended disclosure of the

605
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:15,960
application that's a relatively<font color="#CCCCCC"> short</font>

606
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:17,520
time this process is moving forward with

607
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,230
respect to the Olympic and Red Cross

608
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,330

00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:34,380
concerning those marks is what's going

614
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:36,270
to be applicable come April 12 I guess I

615
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:39,360
want to separate a couple of issues I

616
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:41,490
don't want to comment on whether there

617
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,289
will be any change<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not although you</font>

618
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,059
know for my previous remark you you can

619
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:49,559
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

620
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:52,668
a strong orientation toward keeping

621
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:56,490
things as they are but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

622
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:59,759
conditionality and our original support

623
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:03,809
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those marks my comment about the</font>

624
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:08,220
vote for this week was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really one of</font>

625
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:10,019
that it's procedural in that having been

626
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,970
on the board for a long time in

627
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:17,070
different capacities and having watched

628
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:19,950
the operation the pattern of bringing

629
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:22,490
something into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can week having it</font>

630
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:24,809
go through some public comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> and/or</font>

631
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:29,090
committees and then trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present it</font>

632
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:32,600
for a vote on friday of that week is a

633
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:35,850
flawed process because it leads to a

634
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,740
hasty and incomplete process that leads

635
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:40,949
to very late<font color="#CCCCCC"> night drafting sessions</font>

636
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:43,259
it's not the way to do business we're in

637
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:45,149
the process of trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grow up and one</font>

638
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:48,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the ways of growing up is to be</font>

639
00:31:45,149 --> 00:31:50,809
orderly about doing things so my comment

640
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:54,299
about not voting on this week was really

641
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:57,360
limited to just not being hasty about

642
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:59,580
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things when if and when there is</font>

643
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,860
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to vote on and that it's it's</font>

644
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:04,918
it's brought to maturity<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's reasoned</font>

645
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:07,279
and documented and so forth we have no

646
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:12,389
trouble<font color="#CCCCCC"> bringing it before the board</font>

647
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:14,159
reasonably rapidly also I forgive<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

entities<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply for the same string in</font>

the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld process and secondly could</font>

664
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:56,490
you elaborate a little bit on our tans

00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:57,250
role going into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ITU event indesign</font>

666
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">December</font>

667
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,450
whether you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be there are certain</font>

668
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:04,030
positions or dissipated into missions on

669
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:05,470
issues to discuss discussed and whether

670
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:08,110
you'll actually proceed to the table<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:09,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">any sense then we're having a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

672
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:11,889
of a hard time<font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding you did you</font>

673
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:13,540
get a run I think I got it let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me try to</font>

674
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:16,360
summarize what I believe your two

675
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:18,970
questions were and you can can confirm

676
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,709
or edit that I believe your first

677
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:22,450
question was about what happens if

678
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:24,880
multiple parties apply for the same

679
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:27,670
string and the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld program is that</font>

680
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,590
correct correct thank you and your

681
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:32,740
second question is about what is the

682
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:36,399
role of the ITU these are the other

683
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:41,500
organizations like I can rule ikea in

684
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:43,270
this IPO process and led by<font color="#CCCCCC"> December ok</font>

685
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:48,100
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about the ITU</font>

686
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:52,750
processes and boom by<font color="#E5E5E5"> proper ok and</font>

687
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:56,469
Dubai thank you very much yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font>

688
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:58,570
first with respect to the process for

689
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,580
handlings what we call string contention

690
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:03,850
or when there's multiple applicants for

691
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:06,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same string that consumed about six</font>

692
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:08,918
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> of community discussion and debate</font>

693
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:12,429
and so there's some very elaborate

694
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:16,149
protections and processes in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> program</font>

695
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:19,450
to determine which party wins if there

696
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:22,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">are multiple applications all of which</font>

697
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:25,210
are valid so to summarize that in a very

698
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:27,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple sense the first thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is there's</font>

699
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:29,889
two types of applications there's

700
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:32,110
community applications and all other

701
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:34,450
applications which we call<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard so</font>

702
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:36,879
community versus standard if you're a

703
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:38,230
community group for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chief of</font>

704
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Zulu tribe sent me a letter</font>

705
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:43,929
expressing interest in Zulu well that's

706
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,030
a tribe that's a people a community they

707
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:49,060
could choose to file that if they wished

708
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:51,460
as a community application on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

709
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:54,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand a company filing for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its company</font>

710
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:56,949
name or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a brand name would have to file</font>

711
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:59,319
a standard application if there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

712
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:02,500
community and standard application for

713
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,420
the same string and both applicants pass

714
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,110
all the other hurdles such as the

715
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,750
background checks the financial checks

716
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:12,800
technology checks etc

717
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:16,050
then the community string gets priority

718
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,020
or takes precedence so communities are

719
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:21,870
favored over all other applicants that's

720
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:24,090
one rule then there's other rules that

721
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:27,060
relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to things such as trademarks so</font>

722
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:29,760
if two parties are businesses<font color="#CCCCCC"> that both</font>

723
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:32,279
apply under a standard application if

724
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,730
one owns the trademark and one doesn't

725
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,350
then the rights holder takes precedence

726
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,660
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's also a whole set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

727
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:41,580
objections for parties as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

728
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:44,339
mentioning here that that for any

729
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,830
different reason parties can object to

730
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:50,180
these applications either in the open

731
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:53,250
objections process or in specific

732
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:55,410
objections processes so but I know you

733

reasons that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't able to reach</font>

that deadline and so who is responsible

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> making sure you reach deadlines and</font>

787
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:20,140
then who's what's the timeline for

resolving this how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you going to</font>

789
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">resolve it and if it hasn't worked this</font>

790
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:27,160
time why would what's the belief that

791
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:29,828
you will reach in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> end point in that</font>

792
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,750
in a short period of time speaking from

793
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:33,579
the board perspective the questions that

794
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:39,279
you've asked are the questions of the

795
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:42,430
board is asking of the the staff so i

796
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:44,440
think i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually just simply</font>

797
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:47,500
channel your questions directly over to

798
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:50,619
our CEO and have him deal directly with

799
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:56,400
that I we are watching this process

800
00:38:50,619 --> 00:39:00,880
closely you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think in in fairness</font>

801
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,250
those were no matter what the words we

802
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,490
used about whether its commitment or

803

whether those deadlines it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly</font>

805
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:15,010
to to force results by a certain date so

806
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:18,609
there was a strenuous effort and those

807
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:21,910
were goals that were taken quite

808
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:25,029
seriously not casually but you're you

809
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:26,540

816
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:46,640
bit of anxiety and desire<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reach</font>

817
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:53,420
closure on this we'd like to add to that

that the progress that's been made leads

839
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:47,780
us to believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is still a</font>

possibility of reaching a resolution

from those negotiations and in light of

842
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:57,770
that we believe it's worth continuing to

843
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,940
proceed down that path now that won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

to make a final decision I never have

I've always made<font color="#CCCCCC"> the decision with the</font>

team allowed the team to move to a

887
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:24,210
example of that is that when the Costa

00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:41,850
helped organize the entire successful

894
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:44,340
event bringing many new government's

895

into discussions with ICANN who had not

previously spoken with us

897
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:51,120
and I heard informally from talks after

00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:53,669
the successful ministerial meeting for

899

example that at least one if not more

demonstrated such excellence in

00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:08,160
everything that he's worked upon he was

both gave him very high recommendations

and support for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> position and the</font>

910
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:24,690
reason we created the regional vice

913
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:31,049
it's important to very large

00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:34,590
corporations and many governments at

915
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:37,230
high levels and we felt that rather than

916
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:39,330
coordinate that centrally from a place

917
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:40,950
like the United<font color="#E5E5E5"> States the senior</font>

920
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,100
that's the rationale and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

921
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:52,529
thrilled to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rodrigo taking on that</font>
