Crocker and your own marby welcome hi so

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,830
Steve you've been to a lot of icam

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,550
meetings as this new format changed the

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,830
discussions the new format<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font>

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:27,210
had a big effect more than I had

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,650
expected it might in two ways first of

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,880
all we reduce<font color="#CCCCCC"> the level of formality</font>

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:35,940
without the welcome ceremony and public

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,180
forums and so forth I've got nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,559
positive reactions actually more

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,230
interaction among people more

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,078
satisfaction that different groups could

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,459
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other so it feels like it's</font>

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,140
a pretty big success we're going to wait

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see what the reactions are will do</font>

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:58,079
more careful survey I'm sure but it's

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:59,609
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> been quite refreshing you're</font>

20
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,239
on you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been talking a lot about icons</font>

21
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">role here what's your perspective it's</font>

22
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,149
bennett this has been a very good

23
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,460
meeting because in sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of way justic</font>

24
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">focusing on the policies has been very</font>

25
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">good for us because we didn't you bylaws</font>

26
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,479
and going<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward in a way we describe</font>

27
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,419
the icon organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a support</font>

28
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,539
organization for policy works it's kind

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,450
of been a test bed for that and so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

30
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,159
understand that people appreciate it and

31
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,100
I'm very<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy to be here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the housing</font>

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">kit which is also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my first real I can</font>

33
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,089
meaning to really work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with policies so</font>

34
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,920
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the NTIA recently released</font>

35
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,520
their report on the IANA stewardship

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,840
transition package where do things stand

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,259
of course what we do right now is the

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,840
focus very much on deliverables all the

39
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,840
yellow flags coming up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transition</font>

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,630
so far everything looks good or we are

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,240
we are on time on everything but it's a

42
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,158
together with the community to implement

43
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,589
the decisions from this community is our

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,060
priority right now Steve this this

45
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,909
meetings all the start of the workstream

46
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,950
to enhancing icon accountability what

47
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,660
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we be looking out for</font>

48
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:11,320
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good question there's several</font>

49
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,090
things it's the nature of these kinds of

50
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,799
operations where you divide things up

51
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,060
into a work stream one and work stream

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,030
to that it's a challenge a bit to see

53
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,380
how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what's been delayed or</font>

54
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,209
deferred to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> student who actually</font>

55
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">gets done or whether it gets deferred</font>

56
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:30,459
and deferred further so one of the

57
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,680
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody is going</font>

58
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:34,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for is how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly work</font>

59
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,940
stream<font color="#CCCCCC"> to is going to shape up have a</font>

60
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:41,140
specific schedule specific set of

61
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:43,359
deliverables we also encourage enormous

62
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost during work stream one and there's</font>

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,900
sensitivity about that so as part of the

64
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,150
shaping up of the schedule and the

65
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,280
agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> for work stream to there will</font>

66
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,459
also be considerable attention on the

67
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,959
discipline for the budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so Steve</font>

68
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,550
we recently announced<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thousandth</font>

69
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,770
delegation of a new generic top-level

70
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:05,830
domain it's a major milestone for the

71
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:10,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">program what's the discussion about a</font>

72
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:12,459
next round well as you as you said the

73
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousandth one is not only a milestone</font>

74
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:16,510
because it's a nice round number but it

75
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,720
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very close to the</font>

76
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">end of the processing all the</font>

77
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,750
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we had and the next</font>

78
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:29,260
round<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very much under discussion</font>

79
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:31,030
there's multiple pressures some that are

80
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,040
shaping up of how quickly can we get it

81
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,870
going again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and others that say well we</font>

82
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,940
got to be very careful to learn the

83
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,010
lessons out of the current one make the

84
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:42,670
adjustments and so that tension is

85
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:45,340
playing itself out I think from the

86
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:49,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">boards perspective we're listening</font>

87
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:51,579
intently and don't want this<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font>

88
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,040
overly extended process and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

89
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:56,769
other hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do want to be do the</font>

90
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,690
appropriate due diligence everybody's

91
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:01,329
asking well when what date what date and

92
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:04,180
that turns out to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardest thing</font>

93
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:06,209
it's like predicting the stock market we

94
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:10,030
can sort of tell general directions but

95
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,890
can't tell you the exact date you're on

96
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:16,110
this was your first meeting as I can see

97
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,110

98
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:24,970

101
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,969
and I've had a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time I</font>

102
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:35,290

105
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,260
have to admit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of those things</font>

106
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about is still very hard</font>

107

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to understand especially all the</font>

108
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,860
acronyms but to see this passionate

people coming in to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do</font>

110
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's to improve internet for</font>

111
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,500
everybody that's that's what I take with

112
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,210
me and it gives me comfort going forward

113
