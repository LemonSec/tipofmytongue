14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:57,059
items put in a bid to carry out this

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:02,489
this review<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's why we're here so</font>

16
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:06,270
what is a review for a review really is

17
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:08,939
for us as independent examiner's as a

18
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:12,030
group of consultants based in Paris who

19
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,889
are interested and<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been working on</font>

20

issues of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Governance for many</font>

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,100
years it's an opportunity for us to come

22
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,780
from the outside to engage with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

23
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,610
community in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case the at-large</font>

24
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,790
community to talk to them and above all

25
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:33,689
in the first stages to listen to them

26
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:38,070
and to find out what's going right with

27
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:41,008
the organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's not not not</font>

28
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,380
going so well and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> to formulate a</font>

29
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,729
set of recommendations on how things

30
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,860
could be improved so that if you like is

31
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:54,420
what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing as part of this</font>

32
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:57,869
process to do so we have put together a

33
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:02,759
team a sort of team of four four

34
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:08,190
independent examiner's and so there's

35
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:11,099
myself and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this Nick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thorne timothy</font>

36
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,020
McGuinness and Rosa Delgado in the four

37
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,649
of us we are going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

38
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,610
different

39
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,920
regions of the world and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

40
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,989
working together to formulate a set of

41
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,379
recommendations so it's a 12 month

42
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:28,920
process and we started about a month ago

43
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:34,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">and will be completing the whole process</font>

44
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:36,268
in April 2017 good and if I can just

45
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,159
press you a little bit on the

46
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:40,590
methodology alluded there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12-ounce</font>

47
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">process and what are the exact steps</font>

48
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,810
that are involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in this review</font>

49
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,828
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you as the independent examine are</font>

50
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:51,900
right there was there are several

51
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:55,920
clearly defined steps as we embark on

52
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,230
this process the first is carrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

53
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,950
is listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the community to really</font>

54
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,500
hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> from them the ALS is all these at</font>

55
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:08,129
large structures that that make up the

56
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,530
at large community and to hear from them

57
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:11,970
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so that is what we</font>

58
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:16,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">call it well it's just simply the</font>

59
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:18,090
interview stage of the review process so

60
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,560
that's what we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in Helsinki</font>

61
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,230
and what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing all</font>

62
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:28,560
week talking to people in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Long hour long</font>

63
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:32,578
interviews the second phase is going to

64
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,250
be a survey so that's based on what

65
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,049
we've heard during the interviews we

66
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,269
shall be drawing up a set of

67
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,790
questionnaires which we will present in

68
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:44,609
a survey format and that we will be

69
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,138
carrying out during the next phase then

70
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:48,750
we're all going to come together as a

71
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:53,549
team and we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> analyze the</font>

72
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:57,359
findings and then later on towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

73
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:59,909
end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> early 2017 we're going</font>

74
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:05,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start what we're going to draft a an</font>

75
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:07,620
interim report and in which we will

76
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:11,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">present a first set of recommendations</font>

77
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,780
and so then there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a phase of</font>

78
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,879
presenting those interim recommendations

79
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,089
to the community there will be a two and

80
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,238
forward with the community to allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

81
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:22,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">to maybe fine-tune them and then of</font>

82
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:25,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">course there will be the presentation of</font>

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the final report so in other words it's</font>

84
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:31,070
a process which takes place

85
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,559
with the in an active kind of exchange

86
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:37,010
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> members of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the community while</font>
