of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> own abilities but really come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

92
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:16,929
the multi-stakeholder model itself

tribute to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the multi-stakeholder model</font>

and to the people who make that it would

100
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,330
be disingenuous on my part to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

credit for any success that I may have

had because without your help and

103
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:53,290
contributions in the things I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

104
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:57,280
working on nothing I did would have been

00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:59,350
of any value I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try to</font>

106
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,030
thank individual people because there

107
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:05,830
are too many and I'm sure I would forget

108
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:07,989
some but i do want to at least at a high

109

level say thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to those who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

model and to any part that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i played in</font>

112
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,590
that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i first of all thank god for</font>

113
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,250
giving me the opportunity to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a part</font>

00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:24,349
of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> community i pray every day that</font>

115
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:27,050
my limited capacities would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> blessed</font>

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:32,539
done would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have failed I definitely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

the current team that I'm working with

that simple situation we had back then

157
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:57,459
and of course I have to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

of time is criticized for the way things

169
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,820
happen but without that teamwork we

170
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:29,010
wouldn't be where we are today so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

184
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:13,750
joy and anything that I've contributed

to receive the award on my behalf I do

287
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,160
hope this new meeting structure will go

288
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:18,300
well for everyone in Helsinki and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it</font>

290
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,270
the members of the meeting strategy

291
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:25,170
working group who came up with this new

292
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:27,870
format I can as part of the bold global

293
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,819
experiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> to multi-stakeholder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISM all</font>

294
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,890
the tenants and principles behind the

295
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,990
concept are seeking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide an</font>

296
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,360
alternative to multilateral treaties and

297
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,850
while it can appear that progress can be

298
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,010
glacially slow our work has been

299
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,900
completed at lightning speed by

300
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:46,140
comparison to the general global treaty

301
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,920
processes and always remembering that

302
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:51,090
are sold on one-size-fits-all solutions

303
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,400
so there is much at stake in this

304
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,350
experiment and if a successful internet

305
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,270
governance model is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outcome the</font>

307
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:03,150

308
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:05,820
other global issues massive benefits can

309
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:08,459
accrue from the equal participation by

310
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:12,630
governments business and civil<font color="#CCCCCC"> society</font>
