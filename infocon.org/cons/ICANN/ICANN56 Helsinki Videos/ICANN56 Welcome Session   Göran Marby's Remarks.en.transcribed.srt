00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,550

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,410
I feel sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sort of very much home</font>

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,769
here I hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> Finley's colleagues will not</font>

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,960
disagree with me this is as you said my

12
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,199
first meeting last meeting when I met

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,260
some of you in America<font color="#CCCCCC"> so was a trainee</font>

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,850
since then I've been upgraded and our

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,579
work just to see a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more over</font>

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,530
a month<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think it's very timely for</font>

17
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,870
me to be really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time here</font>

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,600
because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a new type of meeting</font>

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,339
it's a works meeting it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about really</font>

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,789
making sure that policies are driven

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,190
forward the thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and with the</font>

22
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,800
new bylaws coming in it also means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

23
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,199
i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new role comparison my</font>

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,759
predecessor of my organization we also

25
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,408
wanted like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share with you and I</font>

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,790
spoke to some of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it but I</font>

27
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,119
would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share with you it did a</font>

28
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit about what we say it made commerce a</font>

29
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,750
surprise for you that I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> myself</font>

30
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,750
as de precedent of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEO</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I camp</font>

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:30,270
the board now looked at me with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

32
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:32,279
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are together or I can the</font>

33
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,859
board the community and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization</font>

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">I represent it's a Trinity we're in this</font>

35
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,839
together and that's in a very important

36
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:42,089
statement because I see myself in my

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,340
organization my team is someone who is a

38
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,950
support organization to the community on

39
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,270
the board I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a person is going to</font>

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">involve myself in the policy-making</font>

41
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,500
process my job is to facilitate the

42
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:56,009
possibility for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the multi-stakeholder</font>

43
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,369
model and for you to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> your work the</font>

44
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,599
new bylaws the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup is making a</font>

45
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,209
clearer point between my

46
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,579
responsibilities and yours and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I happen</font>

47
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:08,429
to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's very positive because in</font>

48
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,530
an era where we're now coming as you

49
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,030
know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been some milestones in</font>

50
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition process over the last</font>

51
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,500
couple of weeks and months in that area

52
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,030
when we're now going forward we have a

53
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,819
greater responsibility when we had

54
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,319
before and therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I think</font>

55
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,420
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important to make that line</font>

56
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,010
let's be clear this is not something

57
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I dreamed up when I came in this is</font>

58
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,798
<font color="#E5E5E5">something with the board and myself to</font>

59
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,410
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in my team</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked a lot</font>

60
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:33,569
with as you probably have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also</font>

61
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,090
renamed my executive team from global

62
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:37,589
latest executive team just to show also

63
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">the fact that we are support</font>

64
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:44,340
organization going forward we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are here</font>

65
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,510
as a team to support you because you are

66
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ones are actually going to do the</font>

67
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,440
job you're the ones are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

68
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,750
the decisions a very important thing to

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,000
do I've said many times over the last

70
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,859
couple of weeks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually only</font>

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,930
wrote the first chapter in the book of

72
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:59,669
Internet together with you together with

73
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,750

75
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,160
