<font color="#CCCCCC">you I want to cover two things first of</font>

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:18,860
all probably not<font color="#CCCCCC"> uppermost in our mind</font>

4
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:23,520
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a serendipitously a historic</font>

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:26,070
time and place for us to be as<font color="#E5E5E5"> David</font>

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:33,390
is a policy oriented meeting with the

<font color="#E5E5E5">focus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on getting work done limited about</font>

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:41,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">a ceremony about 40 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago this very</font>

10
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:44,699
Hall was the site of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the helsinki</font>

11
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:47,489
accords which also resulted in a

12
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:48,899
significant step forward of cooperation

13
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,699
across the world totally different

14
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,129
subject matter much less important than

15
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:57,449
the weighty matters that we have here

16
00:00:53,129 --> 00:01:00,659
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> but but but I thought it's it's</font>

17
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,690
it's exciting to be here and to be

18
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:05,010
getting down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work in the very place</font>

19
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07,530
this hall I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether there's</font>

20
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">this room but this building that the</font>

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:14,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">helsinki courts were completed in 1975</font>

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:17,820
on behalf<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the board I want to echo</font>

23
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,829
and emphasize what's been said the

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,929
board's posture particularly<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

25
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,508
week is to be completely supportive we

26
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,899
have no meetings almost no meanings of

27
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:33,049
our own scheduled throughout<font color="#CCCCCC"> the week</font>

28
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:35,820
our job is is to be helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be to be</font>

29
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:37,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">aware and involved in what you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

30
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:43,130
to stay out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way as much as</font>

31
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:45,419
possible and and to be hopeful that

32
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:50,130
everybody comes away from this<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting</font>

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:52,829
with great success in actual work done

34
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:56,219
and a very positive feeling it is of

35
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:59,428
course as any first version of something

36
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a bit of an experiment and so we're</font>

37
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:03,479
all watching keenly to see what works

38
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:07,770
what doesn't work looking for feedback

39
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,840
and we'll make adjustments and we noted

40
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,370
that because we now have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these three</font>

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">different kinds of meetings each year</font>

42
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,120
than an adjustment to this meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

43
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,768
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> often so they</font>

44
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,480
response time and the ability to

45
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,459
remember what happened a year earlier

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,700
will be a bit challenging but we're

47
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:26,810
geared up for it and and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that let's</font>

proceed thank you
