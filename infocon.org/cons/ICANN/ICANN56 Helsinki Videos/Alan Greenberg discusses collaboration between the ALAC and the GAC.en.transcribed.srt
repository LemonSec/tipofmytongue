word community<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in fact the magic word</font>

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:23,170
of the overall group in I can is the

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,750
at-large community we are charged with

00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:29,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">making sure that when I can does work</font>

four billion and growing internet users

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:39,850
around the world clearly we are not in a

<font color="#CCCCCC">position to talk to them all and our</font>

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:46,059
challenge is to get make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that the</font>

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,919
needs are satisfied and this is a very

16
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:49,899
diverse group living in many countries

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,780
under many economic conditions many

18
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:54,760
social conditions many cultures so we

19
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,819
have groups around the world currently

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,099
we just hit 200 in cities<font color="#CCCCCC"> and countries</font>

21
00:00:57,819 --> 00:01:03,249
around the world that<font color="#E5E5E5"> feed into our</font>

process the at-large advisory committee

three people per each of the five I can

25

regions that coalesce that bring

together the ideas from the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

in various different forms the advise

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,270
advisory part is in theory we can do

<font color="#CCCCCC">advice but that's not how we necessarily</font>

31
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:34,210
do it on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> day-to-day basis could you</font>

34
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,370
theory is what we do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in practice</font>

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,550
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do is we participate with the</font>

rest of the organization with the gns<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

and the counterpart for country codes

and when they're developing policy when

they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they manage</font>

interestingly use the term public

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,430
have different concerns than we might

62
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government's may be very concerned</font>

63
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,990
about the uses of their country names

64
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,790
for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> whereas we were more</font>

65
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,800
concerned that when your grandmother

uses the computer that she doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

67
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:11,310
confused and very often however the the

results<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those processes we have</font>

interest end up with very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar</font>

71
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,410
conclusions and when they do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

72
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,510
together with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GAC we try to make</font>

73
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that if indeed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something the GAC is</font>

74
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,370
saying is something we<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe in we say</font>

75
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:30,300
so and hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other direction</font>

76
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:32,700
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and increasingly we are working</font>

77
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,769
closely with the GAC with the

78
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,839
governmental advisory committee to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

79
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:39,810
sure to actually come to the conclusions

80
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,730
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only working reacting after</font>

81
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,200
the fact to what people<font color="#CCCCCC"> say but trying</font>

82
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,929
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see where there are common goals</font>

83
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,790
where we can work together<font color="#E5E5E5"> to achieve</font>

84
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,840
our common ends I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> one last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

85
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,970
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> your views in terms of</font>

86
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,590
improvements in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gacks engagements</font>

87
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,650
and collaboration with your community

88
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:02,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">and other communities with my kids I</font>

89
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:05,940
guess the simple view is delighted for a

90
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,250
long time the<font color="#E5E5E5"> perception</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was the GAC is</font>

91
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,079
aloof and doesn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to anyone</font>

92
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,959
else because governments are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

93
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,260
perhaps viewed as if not<font color="#CCCCCC"> more important</font>

94
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,358
apart from the rest of the organization

95
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,659
and increasingly over the last several

96
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,780
years we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have worked together and</font>

97
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,790
increasingly we're seeing the

98
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,890
people from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GAC not representing the</font>

99
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">GAC because a single person cannot</font>

100
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,719
necessarily represent all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the countries</font>

101
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:37,140
but can participate in activities and if

102
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,960
not give the views of the GAC give the

103
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:43,409
views of a national government which may

104
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,359
have similar views to others the a lack

105
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,880
and the GAC have just for the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

106
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,610
at this meeting we have appointed a

107
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,219
liaison a formal<font color="#E5E5E5"> person from the a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lack</font>

108
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,840
to sit with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the GAC and be able to act</font>

109
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,840
as a conduit in information back and

110
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,150
forth so even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though we meet at the same</font>

111
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,789
times we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that there is a</font>

112
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,049
communication path on all counts I think

113
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,510
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important and I'm</font>

114
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,340
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> delighted that we're at that</font>
