00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,590
we have the three<font color="#CCCCCC"> most recent cheers of</font>

00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,020
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ale act that a large Advisory</font>

Alan Greenberg and Olivia<font color="#CCCCCC"> Crippen blonde</font>

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:21,529
Cheryl you are dumb the earliest chair

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:23,899
in this group so how would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you describe</font>

7
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:27,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">the role of a large community and I can</font>

8
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:30,619
ah right we have had long conversations

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,200
about this and during our very first day

10
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:37,010
like review we agreed as a community

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,770
that what we were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> was acting in</font>

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:42,260
the best interests of the internet end

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:46,690
user and the individual domain name

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:49,430
registrar so overarching that is our job

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">Alan where you think well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,079
certainly the right answer as an

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:57,410
overview that doesn't really tell people

18
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,350
what we do what we do within I can in

19
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,898
<font color="#CCCCCC">general we are officially an advisory</font>

20
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,299
committee but the bulk of our time is

21
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:07,790
not spending is not spent in advising

22
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:10,250
the board or other groups but actively

23
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:14,630
participating in the various processes

24
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:18,320
so we feel that the best way we can

25
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:21,259
represent the interests of users we can

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,270
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the needs of users do</font>

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:27,490
show up in the policies that I can

28
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:29,960
develops is to be there on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ground</font>

29
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,149
actively working with the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

30
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,009
community and making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when the</font>

31
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,790
policies come out they will meet the

32
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:40,460
needs of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the users I guess the important</font>

33
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:42,140
thing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is that in order to get</font>

34
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,759
the input from the community you also

35
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,770
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go out there in search for it</font>

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,140
and that's where outreach part comes

37
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,119
from we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have to go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

38
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,860
search<font color="#CCCCCC"> for new people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

39
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,110
interested in I can that are interested

40
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:58,430
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the processes and that will then be</font>

41
00:01:54,110 --> 00:02:00,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to contribute thank you um so due</font>

42
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,509
to the outreach work I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I large</font>

43
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,939
just reached one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most recent</font>

44
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:08,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">milestones are passing 200 a large</font>

45
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:10,310
structures so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like to be a chair</font>

46
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:13,220
for such a diverse community

47
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:18,380
Alan do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think oh I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

48
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:22,520
there's a single word certainly it's

49
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:25,250
empowering because when you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use all</font>

50
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,900
of the resources that are out there it's

51
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,110
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any single</font>

52
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,970
individual can do it is exhilarating at

53
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,010
times because sometimes it really all

54
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,410
pulls together and works and it's a

55
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,560
challenge we're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a very</font>

56
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:42,980
diverse community<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually getting them</font>

57
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,040
to come to come to a common end means

58
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,560
compromise it means adjusting people's

59
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,840
views and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always difficult but</font>

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,600
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it that's great it's</font>

61
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,150
actually also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge responsibility and</font>

62
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,130
one that I know is as leadership we've

63
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:02,569
always taken very very seriously I mean

64
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:05,690
we we are part of a key voice coming in

65
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:07,819
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mainstay of icons policy</font>

66
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,579
development work as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> advice we</font>

67
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:13,149
may give in a formal sense and it's

68
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,560
being as I was saying earlier engaged

69
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,620
bringing a pinion and voice to the table

70
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,120
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions and concerns back to</font>

71
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,060
the edge communities through our at

72
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,180
large structures and things like that so

73
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:28,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's it's a very privileged position to</font>

74
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,780
be in and it's one that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think each of</font>

75
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:34,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">us have tried to make sure we leave our</font>

76
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,850
personal views and baggage even the

77
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,519
views and opinion of groups we would

78
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:43,220
normally represent at the meeting room

79
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,620
door and we act with independence and

80
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,900
impartiality to make sure consensus is a

81
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,290
full reflection but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's also an awful</font>

82
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,700
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun I've heard Alan say that it</font>

83
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,638
was exhilarating you know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> days</font>

84
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,649
you'll cry some days some days you'll be

85
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:59,540
delighted about the the effect and

86
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,170
what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'll think wow it</font>

87
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,100
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really works but it's extremely</font>

88
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,690
challenging and I would I would just

89
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,410
call it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ride of your life</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

90
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:12,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">true a very good so speaking of</font>

91
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,510
challenges looking ahead what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

92
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,238
are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenges and opportunities for</font>

93
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:18,918
a large community well I guess I just

94
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,690
alluded to them in the last and last

95
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,710
answer the challenges and the

96
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,050
opportunities go together

97
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,258
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with a lot of different</font>

98
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:31,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who have very strong needs not</font>

99
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:35,430
always the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same getting them to come</font>

100
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:37,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">together you know it's it's something I</font>

101
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">think akin to raising children that you</font>

102
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,340
put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of effort into it and then you</font>

103
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,650
cross your fingers and hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

104
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,630
end they come out right and they come

105
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,849
out good and you never can quite predict

106
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,759
how they're going to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out but if</font>

107
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:54,180
you're lucky<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of skill it</font>

108
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,639
works well so challenges opportunities

109
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're all merged together I guess the</font>

110
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,669
opportunity is ready to showcase that

111
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,880
the motifs they call the model actually

112
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:04,349
can work and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what it does and</font>

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,370
that's what I find really amazing about

114
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:10,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">it look some of the challenges are still</font>

115
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,020
linked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the enormity of the task we</font>

116
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,479
have you know we're presenting the best

117
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,849
interests<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us we were acting in the</font>

118
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,860
best interests of the billions<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

119
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:22,349
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as those yet to</font>

120
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">join the internet and that's that in</font>

121
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:25,469
itself is a challenge but of course that

122
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:27,240
means we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the diversity</font>

123
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,009
of the cultures we have to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

124
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,889
the diversity of the languages we need

125
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:33,990
to work in so there's there's logistical

126
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,550
challenges like that but the

127
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,430
opportunities are of course to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

128
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,620
right and I actually think that this

129
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,969
multi-stakeholder model perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> under</font>

130
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">the guidance of chairs like you're</font>

131
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:47,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at now and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm so many years</font>

132
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:51,300
away i can say that we're an important

133
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:54,270
part of ICANN getting the

134
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,580
multi-stakeholder voice out of the edge

135
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,859
communities of internet users and
