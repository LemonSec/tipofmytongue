and Internet Protocol numbers that goes

8
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:39,080
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I think around 1982 and so</font>

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,120
anyone can use it depending on what they

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,370
want to look up they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can look up a</font>

information about a domain or they can

13
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:54,800
look up information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Internet</font>

14
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:56,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">Protocol numbers could you give us a</font>

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,260
brief<font color="#CCCCCC"> overview of the background to the</font>

16
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:06,470
review and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> potential to the police</font>

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:09,140
the who is system well like I said the

18
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,600
who is protocol goes back to nineteen

19
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,950
eighty-two and for the most part it

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,589
hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed very much since then</font>

21
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">although a lot of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have done</font>

22
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,999
secondary things to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a little</font>

23
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:25,909
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> user-friendly so it's terribly</font>

24
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:31,969
outdated the and so the working group

25
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:33,859
and let me back up the community<font color="#CCCCCC"> the i</font>

26
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:38,568
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kent community has been working on who</font>

27
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:41,030
is for I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> over 15 years a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

28
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:43,100
things have been done but very little

29
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:47,929
progress has been made because there are

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:50,208
a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> points of view with</font>

31
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:53,060
regard to how much data should be

32
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:56,149
displayed or not and so this working

33
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,649
group is task with following<font color="#E5E5E5"> through and</font>

34
00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:02,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">some preparatory work that's been done</font>

35
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:05,389
over the last couple years to try and

36
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:11,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">reach some consensus on some basic</font>

37
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:13,840
decisions the basic decisions are is a

38
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:18,260
new

39
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:22,760
system required to replace the current

40
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:28,040
who is or could the existing who is be

41
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:31,100
modified to meet any requirements that

42
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,940
the working group comes up with so if

43
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,359
you see this has been a long-running

44
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,980
discussion within the community what as

45
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,200
a result the working groups decided to

46
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,260
take a phased approach to its work can

47
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,399
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain what this means sure well</font>

48
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,910
first of all with regard to your first

49
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,250
question yes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a long standing</font>

50
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:54,100
issue in the community but with regard

51
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:56,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the phased approach there is a an</font>

52
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,390
implementation group after the expert

53
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:04,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group on registration data</font>

54
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:07,269
services that developed a framework and

55
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:10,720
that framework suggested three phases

56
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:16,340
the first phase is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop</font>

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:18,170
requirements for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a possible RDS system</font>

58
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,410
whether it's old or whether it's the

59
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:25,309
modified version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of who is the second</font>

60
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:27,230
phase then would be assuming that the

61
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:32,990
decision is made<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a new system is</font>

62
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:35,179
needed would be to develop policies to

63
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:41,140
fulfill the<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements from phase 1</font>

64
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:44,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the third phase would be actually to</font>

65
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:47,420
develop<font color="#CCCCCC"> the implementation guidelines</font>

66
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:50,359
and and it actually do what's necessary

67
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:53,890
to implement the policies in phase 2<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

68
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:58,580
should note though that phases<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 and 3</font>

69
00:03:53,890 --> 00:04:00,619
may be done somewhat in sync whereas

70
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,530
phase one definitely has to be done

71
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,300
first the working groups already

72
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,600
identified a number of interrelated

73
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,250
issues are which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to address can</font>

74
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:17,420
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> give us an idea of what these issues</font>

75
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:19,459
might be well there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually 11</font>

76
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:22,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter I won't go</font>

77
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:25,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">through all 11 questions but three that</font>

78
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">are very important to answer and for</font>

79
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:32,560
which requirements

80
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:36,070
are needed are what is the purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

81
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,919
who are the users of who is another very

82
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:43,180
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is how does privacy</font>

83
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:45,520
come into play as you probably know

84
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:49,300
there are different privacy laws all

85
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,620
over the world and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a third one that's</font>

86
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:55,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">really important what are the data</font>

87
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:57,610
elements in who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there are again eight</font>

88
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:59,110
other questions but I won't go through

89
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of those now they're certainly</font>

90
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,880
available so for opportunities will

91
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:07,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">Helsinki provide to further the work of</font>

92
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:11,940
the working group well first of all on

93
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:16,090
Monday afternoon at I think 3 p.m.

94
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:19,570
there's a cross-community session on the

95
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:21,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">RDS PDP working group where everyone is</font>

96
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:25,659
invited and that session will be

97
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:27,330
designed for guests people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are not</font>

98
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,039
part of the working group are not even

99
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:33,550
observers although those people will be

100
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:37,120

105
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer their questions so we really want</font>

106
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,990
it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an interactive session</font>

107
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,449
primarily focusing on the guests that

108
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:55,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">are in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> room I'm looking beyond</font>

asking people in the room to suggest

121

requirements and if all goes well we may

122
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:35,229
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a little further than that in</font>

not be any visitor participation or even
