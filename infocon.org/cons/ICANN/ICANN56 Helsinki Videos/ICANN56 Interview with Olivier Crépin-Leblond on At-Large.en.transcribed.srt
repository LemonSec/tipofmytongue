00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,859
what was a large community like when you

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,050
just assumed the chair position well it

7
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:26,380
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite lucky actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when I started</font>

being chair in katakana in Colombia

00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,580
because prior to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> being chair there</font>

10
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:32,470
was Cheryl Langdon or and she had

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,570
actually managed to put together a group

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,519
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> active and it</font>

13
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:40,180
was very motivated motivated to do

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,480
things and to bring forward the view of

15
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,460
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end users in the icon processes so</font>

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,709
when I took over I already<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a</font>

17
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:51,280
functioning organization to start with

18
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:53,560
my sole contribution really was to start

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,810
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how to scale it up and how to</font>

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,720
also get the other parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

21
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:02,260
community and I can to know that we were

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,820
here and we were not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the nosy</font>

23
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,319
neighbor next door<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was going to</font>

24
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,090
cause problems for everyone but we were

25
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,788
ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with everyone else to make</font>

26
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,560
a better I can and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually serve the</font>

27
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:15,429
interest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> end users was at the same</font>

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also making I can grow can you</font>

29
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:20,950
elaborate a little bit a little bit more

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how you scaled up the large</font>

31
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:26,109
community so initially as you know the

32
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:28,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">at large is is that you've got the 15</font>

33
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:30,729
member atlarge<font color="#CCCCCC"> Advisory Committee and</font>

34
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,969
then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the regional at large</font>

35
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:37,090
organizations that that we've got five

36
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:39,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these and the there was a disconnect</font>

37
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,950
if you want between the a lack itself

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,069
and the regional at large organizations

39
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,899
in that there was no location where

40
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:49,240
everyone could work together so one of

41
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:51,340
the ways to scale up at large was to

42
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,770
create working groups so as to be able

43
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,229
to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> thumb attic work taking place</font>

44
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:59,048
and we also had to recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some</font>

45
00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:01,119
of our members were more interested in I

46
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:02,950
can policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and purely working on I can</font>

47
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,170
policy whilst others were interested in

48
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,569
growing the organization and doing a lot

49
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,759
of work on outreach so our first working

50
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:11,230
groups were about policy processes one

51
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,959
of them being<font color="#E5E5E5"> the generic top-level</font>

52
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,530
domain process that was extremely

53
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,230
important when I started

54
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,180
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just about to be launched</font>

55
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,489
officially by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board and so we had a</font>

56
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,260
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group set up for that we also</font>

57
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,510
had working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups on outreach and</font>

58
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,420
engagement and they also started their

59
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,870
work at around the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> the third</font>

60
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we also did was to start</font>

61
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,290
industrializing or a policy

62
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,780
recommendation work instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having ad</font>

63
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">hoc emails being sent to our mailing</font>

64
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,120
list and saying well are we interested

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,000
in contributing in this piece of policy

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,910
advice are we interested in responding

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">to this public comment we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually had a</font>

68
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:57,630
table<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up and we made extensive use</font>

69
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,370
of wikis in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to have</font>

70
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,140
that information available and in a

71
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,519
format that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was understandable by</font>

72
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,799
everyone so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort of thing</font>

73
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,880
when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean industrialization we started</font>

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,980
putting some real points at various

75
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,660
parts of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> wikis that people could go</font>

76
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,329
to and they could immediately be

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,859
involved and know what was going on

78
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:19,170
information is extremely important in an

00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,769
organization that is bottom-up and that

80
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:26,030
is so diversified as at larges thank you

five regional at large organizations and

96
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,310
so some parts of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world where not</font>

well represented at the table or at

<font color="#E5E5E5">Eastern Europe was less well represented</font>

and so focus was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the focus was put on</font>

the Eastern Europe<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it SAT around</font>

that time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we also worked on an</font>

LS and at large structure into every

away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> having reached that goal but</font>

112
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,270
we are slowly moving and engaging with

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,620
more and more at large structures in

114
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,068
countries that we hadn't previously

the work outreach is extremely important

also when I can goes into countries that

118
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:55,940
it has never<font color="#E5E5E5"> visited before because we</font>

119
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:58,940
need to get the buy-in of the local

120
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,099
community the internet is not just a

121
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,680
technical network it's a network that is

122
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:04,909
made up of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the big difference</font>

123
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">between the internet and in the other</font>

125
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:13,370
was for end users worldwide and that's

126
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,830
what makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the strength of the</font>

127

would function<font color="#E5E5E5"> top down that would</font>

130
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:24,530
probably be seen as a little cabal of

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> running the internet when in fact</font>

132
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,789
it's exactly the opposite it is an

133
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,758
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is open and that</font>

134
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:33,889
engages anybody and everybody to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

place all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their different communities</font>

they're the ones that should be thanked

150
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,280
about this because more often than not

151
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,229
they're the ones who<font color="#CCCCCC"> can refer other</font>

organizations to come and<font color="#E5E5E5"> join the at</font>

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see and we also know that a large</font>

158
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,469
the first summit was held in 2009 in

159
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,440
Mexico City<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on the second</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one was</font>

the 2014 in London when you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> de la</font>

161

chair can you talk a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about</font>

162
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:40,969
the origin of the summit and its

163
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:41,729
significance to I can so a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

164
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:43,889
in

165
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:45,960
I can takes place at<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICANN meetings a</font>

166
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:48,360
lot of work also takes place using

167
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,859
conference calls one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems</font>

168
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,629
with conference calls is that you don't

169
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that personal interaction with</font>

170
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:55,710
other people and so being able to get

171
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:58,469
people to interact with<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other</font>

172
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:01,049
face-to-face was something seen as being

173
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:03,029
vital to creating a community you can't

174
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,150
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a virtual community it's not</font>

175
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:08,460
a community as such so the first summit

176
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,558
manage to get nearly I think it was

177
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,229
close to a hundred at large structures

178
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:15,689
to come together many of which<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

179
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:17,669
joined but didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite know what I can</font>

180
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:20,849
was about what weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite aware of</font>

181
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:23,279
what to do and when it came down to

182
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:26,819
meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> face-to-face in Mexico City and</font>

183
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:29,969
discussing various topics which they had

184
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:32,370
decided to discuss many people suddenly

185
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:34,020
saw the light as one could say and said

186
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wow and now I know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is about</font>

187
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,558
now I've experienced the icon meeting

188
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,059
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit like talking about</font>

189
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:44,399
cycling and also cycling itself if you

190
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:45,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">use a cycle it's totally different than</font>

191
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,789
actually just being given a manual on

192
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to use a cycle and it was the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

193
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:52,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing also with the icon meetings in</font>

194
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:54,748
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> at-large community they did a</font>

195
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:58,379
number of well they had quite a few

196
00:07:54,749 --> 00:08:00,089
meetings in Mexico they all managed to

197
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,069
get something<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it and we had some</font>

198
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:05,099
of our best elements in the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> year's</font>

199
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:07,589
that had met for the first time at the

200
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:10,709
meeting in Mexico and that then became

201
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:12,719
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved afterwards five years</font>

202
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:14,370
later the second summit I think it's

203
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:16,949
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> roughly five years later</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

204
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,779
second summit in London was a little bit

205
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:20,309
different because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had also a lot of</font>

206
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:22,620
new at large structures but there was

207
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:24,809
also this course set of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had</font>

208
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,539
already been to the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> at large</font>

209
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:29,909
summit and those people managed to pull

210
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:32,370
things forward and ended up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

211
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:35,068
statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had a large number of</font>

212
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:37,318
recommendations some of which had been

213
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:40,380
discussed in conference calls beforehand

214
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:42,299
but never with everyone involved when

215
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,010
you meet face to face is the only time

216
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,380
when you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have everybody in</font>

217
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,480
the room at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time I remind you</font>

218
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,829
the earth is a round thing and

219
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,110
unfortunately we can't do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

it if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a virtual meeting you're</font>

221
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,500
going to have time zones will be the

222
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,699
middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the night for some people it</font>

223
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,380
will be the middle of the working day

224

for others and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will end up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,250
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved we managed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tap all</font>

of their input we managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

230
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,860
together a statement with all of these

231
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,900
recommendations and then since that

232
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,400
summit we have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on about</font>

implementing these recommendations

because we knew this had the<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy-in from</font>
