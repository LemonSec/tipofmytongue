00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:17,860
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> our rights protection mechanisms</font>

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:19,210
and why are they important David thanks

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,788
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> having us thanks for this interview</font>

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to mention the other two</font>

Corwin and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jay Scott Evans rights</font>

10
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:31,200
protection mechanisms are the mechanisms

11
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:32,650
created within I can to protect

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,140
intellectual property rights

13
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:38,769
particularly trademark rights and since

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:41,289
the beginning of I can we've known that

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,180
trademark rights were implicated in the

16
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:45,789
domain name system and we've come up

17
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,530
with ways to try to balance trademark

18
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:50,170
rights and the rights of others for

19
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,879
access to domain names and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to</font>

20
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,850
balance so that when there were disputes

21
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:57,099
there were ways to reconcile them the

22
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,719
uniform dispute resolution process has

23
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,760
never been substantially reviewed before

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,100
can you explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> the motivation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for doing</font>

25
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,679
so and I the uniform dispute resolution

26
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,290
policy and process are the oldest

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,060
consensus policies within I can and they

28
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,630
haven't been reviewed because we haven't

29
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:16,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">really had a chance to sit down and take</font>

30
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:18,369
a big look at them and we've been busy

31
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">creating new rights protection</font>

32
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,490
mechanisms that we'll talk about in a

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,290
second so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a chance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

34
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,939
roll back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very beginning to take</font>

35
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,220
a look and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's part of the purpose of</font>

00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:30,548
<font color="#E5E5E5">this working group to look at both new</font>

37
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:33,039
and older rights protection mechanisms

38
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:34,630
and really get a big picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you</font>

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,549
talk us through the areas that the

40
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,619
working group has already identified for

41
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:41,799
review and the phased approach which

42
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:44,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to take the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working group</font>

43
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,210
has identified both new and old rights

44
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,799
protection mechanisms and we're actually

45
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,360
going to start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the newer ones the</font>

46
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,909
rights protection mechanisms that were

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,100
created<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the new generic top-level</font>

domains for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rollout that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we started</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">doing in 2012 and that row is still in</font>

50
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,210
progress<font color="#E5E5E5"> today as we roll out new</font>

51
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:03,490
top-level domains and because there were

52
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,619
a number of new top-level domains coming

53
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,750
out all at the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we created a</font>

54
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:09,399
new set of protections for trademarks

55
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,760
includes the trademark Clearinghouse

56
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:15,160
this includes the trademark notice and

57
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,840
the sunrise period all of which are

58
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,620
terms that will be explained if people

59
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,629
are interested in coming

60
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,540
into the working group will explain will

61
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:24,609
share and it also includes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> urs the</font>

62
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,310
uniform rapid suspension and so we're

63
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,019
going to be looking at those rights

64
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,110
protection mechanisms first ones created

65
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:35,560
for new gTLDs and then we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

66
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">back and phase 2 and look at kind of the</font>

67
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,040
grandfather of them all the foundation

68
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,620
which is the uniform dispute resolution

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,629
policy and there are a number of other

70
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,909
community initiatives ongoing at the

71
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:48,250
moment particularly the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld</font>

working groups activities that's a very

00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">good question so in order to roll out</font>

77
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,420
new top-level domains there's a number

78
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:04,030
of reviews that have to take place we

79
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,599
have to review and rethink areas of the

80
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,010
new detail the applicant guidebook and

81
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,839
only one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> areas is rights</font>

82
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,640
protection mechanisms there are all

sorts of other areas for from the

96
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,549
that's useful for for the work that

104
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,599
finish up hopefully and around the same

105

time frame so that we can open<font color="#E5E5E5"> up new</font>

rounds of new gTLDs so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Helsinki</font>

for community involvement will this new

format present another good question

because this is a a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new type of meeting</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with actually much more time to</font>

Monday<font color="#E5E5E5"> afternoon that will really</font>

118
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,770
present kind of an overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

119
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:28,599
we're working on dive into some of the

details that we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in phase</font>

123
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,849
kinds of questions people have the kinds

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">of issues and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> concerns that they have as</font>

126
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:45,789
see gathered so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're so that</font>

127
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:47,889
they and we as a community are better

128
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:49,929
informed as we go into these evaluations

129
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:52,749
of the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD rights protection</font>

130
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:54,578
mechanisms then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have another meeting</font>

131
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:56,739
on Thursday morning which will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font>

working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group itself and here we're</font>

133
00:04:56,739 --> 00:05:00,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be continuing the calls that we</font>

134
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:02,019
have every week and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to be</font>

135
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:05,289
diving into a discussion of the

136
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:08,319
trademark PDD RP post delegation dispute

137
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:11,199
resolution policy which is a discussion

138
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,929
actually of questioning the delegation

139
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,429
of a new top-level domain and so

140
00:05:13,929 --> 00:05:17,078
although it's never been used we're

141
00:05:15,429 --> 00:05:19,149
reviewing that policy will be meeting

142
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:22,299
with providers of the dispute resolution

143
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:24,789
process if questions and contentions and

144
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:27,818
complaints come up and so we have these

145
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:29,289
two meetings one kind of a broad cross

146
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:31,929
community meeting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday afternoon</font>

147
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:34,599
and one to allow everyone to deep dive

148
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:36,998
with us into a traditional working group

149
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:38,919

150
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:42,119
and expectations for the meetings this

151
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:45,969
week I hope that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meetings this week</font>

152
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:48,550
will create a broader interest in

153
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:50,229
outreach across the community for<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

154
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,909
participation in the working group we

155
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:54,489
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of members but we could</font>

156
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:56,349
always use more and particularly if

157
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:57,729
people have some experience and some of

158
00:05:56,349 --> 00:06:00,429
the rights protection mechanisms that

159
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:02,619
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working with issues concerns ideas</font>

160
00:06:00,429 --> 00:06:04,208
but also those who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> and who want to</font>

161
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:06,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">come with us down the path of looking at</font>

162
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:07,989
rates protection mechanisms so we're

163
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:09,579
hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tapes are viewed by</font>

164
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:11,649
others maybe who couldn't participate in

165
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:12,999
the meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and also that if people are</font>

166
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:15,309
interested they'll come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> either as</font>

167
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:16,539
observers<font color="#E5E5E5"> or as members and if they have</font>

168
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:18,459
questions that they'll reach out to the

169
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:20,110
co-chairs and ask us questions so that

170
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:22,389
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> facilitate their increased</font>
