structures and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> that grew it was</font>

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,730
recognized that the geographic diversity

59
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:48,988
that we needed needed to be sought after

60
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:50,988
and managed so we created a regional

structure whereby the<font color="#E5E5E5"> at-large</font>

structures in geographic regions that I

63
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,970
can users were clustered together and we

64
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,120
put in a sort of a middle layer to

65
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,040
facilitate and enable communication and

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,920
information exchange and that's called

67
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">our regional at large organization so we</font>

68
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,048
started off<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two-tier approach and</font>

69
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:16,138
we've come towards a three-tier approach

70
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:19,010
that's operated effectively certainly

71
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:22,620
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> around two thousand and five six</font>

we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the importance and</font>

76
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,829
they're becoming much more critical

points of information exchange than we

78
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:39,810
had even hoped in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beginning and so</font>

we're all going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a review at this</font>

81
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:47,669
we'll have had an external look at how

82
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:49,798
this is all working and we're hoping

83
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:51,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we might even have a smoother more</font>

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique and balanced thing in I can</font>

93
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:17,548
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have three sitting members</font>

94
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:20,609
from each of the five geographic regions

95
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:24,090
two of those members are now appointed

96
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:25,740
by these regional at large organizations

97
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,770
they could appoint someone who's not a

98
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,960
member but they make the appointment the

99
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,400
third<font color="#CCCCCC"> person</font>

100

in each this geographic regions

101
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,479
disappointed by something called the

102
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,430
nominating committee and the nominating

103
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:39,229
committee which I'd encourage people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

104
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,229
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and learn more about they've got</font>

105
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:46,008
their own website and they do vital work

106
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:48,380
for I can put into place a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:50,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in a number of parts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of I can</font>

108
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,880
including the ICANN board but for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

109
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,620
they put the third<font color="#E5E5E5"> person in for each of</font>

also know there are many other group

sing I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> how does a large differ from</font>

118
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:18,619
other groups oh well we do and we don't

119
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:20,690
in a number of ways there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number</font>

120
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,000
of at large structures and indeed

121
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:26,240
individuals because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> regions will</font>

122
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,960
take members of an individual status as

123
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,139
well who may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be involved in other parts</font>

124
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,900
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can or may be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> involved in as a</font>

125
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:38,270
member or an active participant in other

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,900
organizations that belong to other parts

127
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:44,030
of I can so there is often a crossover

128
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:47,060
but what is specifically the difference

129
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,940
point with us is as we act<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,560
interests of Internet users both those

00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,719
yet to connect our view is not

all of the others you'll find quite

00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:11,750
necessarily and quite effectively work

138
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,989
within a particular focus so they may

work within the gns<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh as a constituency</font>

140
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,880
within the gns oh but we have our

mandate we're an advisory committee to
