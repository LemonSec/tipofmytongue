13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,959
well yes this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> place where ccTLDs</font>

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:45,920
come together discuss things of exchange

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,800
information share best practice and very

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,110
good and how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work of the GAC</font>

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,690
the governmental<font color="#CCCCCC"> advisory committee</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">influence your work well first of all I</font>

19
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:59,360
must say that all governments are very

20
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:03,879
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> for ccTLDs because in every</font>

21
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,530
country there's a ccTLD and they must

22
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:10,310
work together with their respective

23
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:14,090
government and therefore of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course we're</font>

24
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:15,470
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in what gag does and</font>

25
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,520
we're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in information</font>

26
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:21,950
exchange with Jack and no it's a well

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,670
it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to hear opinions</font>

28
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,800
of different governments of course each

29
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:31,100
country and therefore each ccTLDs

30
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,679
different but in working<font color="#E5E5E5"> together it can</font>

31
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:37,399
make things better absolutely but how do

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,860
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the work of the CC NSO impacts</font>

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:44,979
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> work of the governmental advisory</font>

34
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:47,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">committee oh well I think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

35
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:51,320
recent years<font color="#E5E5E5"> GAC has been more</font>

36
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:54,920
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> you gtld than in their own</font>

37
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:59,449
ccTLDs but we do hope that situation

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:02,119
will change and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be closed and</font>

39
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">closed with Jack again and I think there</font>

40
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">are many many interesting things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

41
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:09,288
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss and this meeting here in</font>

42
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:11,120
Helsinki is<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy forum and cross</font>

43
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:14,569
community worker will be a good

44
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,850
indicator for the years to come goes up

45
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:19,100
we worked a lot to prepare

46
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:21,380
they're this cross-community session

47
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,600
with gag discussions were going to talk

48
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,670
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy development process and</font>

49
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,840
we're also going to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

50
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:33,350
survey that was a recently run<font color="#E5E5E5"> by by gak</font>

51
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,710
and well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope that the</font>

52
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:40,190
discussion will be very interesting and

53
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:43,100
we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of things talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

54
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:46,160
very good and I have another question

55
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,799
for you that what are you views in terms

56
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,930
of improvements in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gax engagement</font>

57
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,580
and collaboration with your community

58
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:58,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other communities in I can I must</font>

59
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,590
confess that not always<font color="#CCCCCC"> our meetings</font>

60
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:06,079
have been very interesting and

61
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:10,580
interactive but<font color="#CCCCCC"> well in the past we had</font>

62
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,670
some a group of from each community that

63
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:17,750
worked the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the group was to work</font>

64
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:19,940
on the program for meetings and I think

65
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:23,510
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go we have to revive</font>

66
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:26,060
that model because it's always better

67
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,579
well I really hope that the meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

68
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,880
time will show us that when we work

69
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,950
together to prepare agenda for our

70
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:37,670
meeting we have it more interesting and

71
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:40,100
more interaction so at the end of the

72
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:43,040
day it will bring much more benefits to

73
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:45,320
both communities and yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font>

74
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">is something that probably that's what</font>

75
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:51,890
why the policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ma was introduced in</font>

76
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:55,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first place this cross community</font>

77
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:58,160
work and when when we work specifically

78
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:02,350
targeting go these sessions when we

79
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:05,030
prepare them in advance or when we

80
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,519
really structure the meeting alright so

81
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,920
I hope it's going to be great and I

82
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,470
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should work in the</font>

83
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">future as well very good well thank you</font>

84
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:17,238
<font color="#CCCCCC">for answering my question well thank you</font>

85
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:20,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">for asking this and I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for it</font>

86
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,108
