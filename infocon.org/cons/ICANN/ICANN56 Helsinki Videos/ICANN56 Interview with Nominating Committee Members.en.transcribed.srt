to to appoint me<font color="#E5E5E5"> chair after after this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that there is continuity in the</font>

to be part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the leadership team this</font>

50
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:17,700
year to learn how we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing</font>

51
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:19,260
things and then we also have an

52
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,208
associate chair who is picked by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

chair who's been serving as chair

54
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,930
previously so that we get the historic

55
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,909
perspective and and experience as well

56
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the leadership team what will your</font>

57
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:30,328
focus be is the chair after observing<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

outcome leadership over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past year</font>

59
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:34,109
well in many way i would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font>

60
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,849
continue what we've been doing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

last couple of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> before being Chair</font>

62
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:39,268
Elect i was on the noncom for two years

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,790
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well and over the last year we've</font>

64
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:43,470
been refining the processes and they

65
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,510
seem to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> working pretty well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no so</font>

66
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,400
it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like developed what we have</font>

67
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,409
and making the improvement that will

68
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,870
learn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing this</font>

69
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:53,909
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a time of</font>

70
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,470
transition for<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can but is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business</font>

71
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:57,900
as usual for the NAM<font color="#E5E5E5"> come or are there</font>

72
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,480
specific challenges I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's very</font>

73
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,659
specific challenges this year and also

74
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">the years ahead because if on sep tember</font>

75
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:11,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">sergey's the younger transition is</font>

76
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:15,540
completed<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can will on its own feet and</font>

77
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:19,699
is then treated as an independent global

78
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:24,000
corporation and I think this globalized

79
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:26,190
few has to be reflected in icons

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,519
leadership so that means more than any

81
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,799
before we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

82
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:35,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">consideration such to your political</font>

83
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,139
geostrategic observations so that make

84
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:41,040
clear also for the rest of the world in

85
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:43,109
particular for the 165 members of the

86
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,560
governmental advisory committee that

87
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:50,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">icon is indeed a global cooperation</font>

88
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:54,389
another corporation dominated by some

89
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:56,638
from the north and some male white men

90
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:58,889
and this brings me to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second point</font>

91
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:03,739
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue of gender</font>

92
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:07,129
balance place<font color="#CCCCCC"> also a role so far we have</font>

93
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:10,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 board members and only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five a woman</font>

94
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:11,909
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is a challenge in front</font>

95
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,228
<font color="#E5E5E5">Lee's to find what's so special about</font>

96
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,179
this meeting which the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAM come is</font>

97
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:18,329
calling its selection meeting let me

98
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:22,048
just go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a point Wolfgang just</font>

99
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">made on both the gender diversity and</font>

100
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:25,539
the work

101
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:28,240
noncom does with respect to the wider

102
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:33,150
board there is a lot of talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

103
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:36,610
diversity within<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can be agenda geo</font>

104
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,560
community other types of diversity the

105
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,140
icon community is striving to be as

106
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,110
diverse as it can be but I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

107
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:47,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">it very very clear that the num com can</font>

108
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:50,230
only select from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the amount that the</font>

109
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,900
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that apply we can only select</font>

110
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:55,960
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slate of incoming applications</font>

111
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:59,310
so a lot of the work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do and</font>

112
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:02,979
you've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> us say this in past</font>

113
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:05,740
conversations that we've had for this

114
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:09,400
type of event a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work that we do</font>

115
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,740
is to outreach before our application

116
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,210
period in order to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can</font>

117
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,700
reach out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that would probably</font>

118
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,430
not normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply because they would</font>

119
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,770
either not know about the process or

120
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,650
would not feel that they would fit into

121
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,630
the process and that's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

122
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,270
part of the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do so that when</font>

123
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:31,600
we come to this selection meeting where

124
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:35,229
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the cards are on the table we</font>

125
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,900
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a slate of applicants we can't</font>

126
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:41,530
really do anything about that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

127
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,870
try and choose from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best or try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

128
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,580
choose the best from that slate when the

129
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,180
cards are on the table at this meeting

130
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:51,359
we have the ability is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a non come to</font>

131
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,490
make choices<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will promote diversity</font>

132
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,620
so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does start with the</font>

133
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,080
community and and the people that are

134
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,480
applying into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this process if we can get</font>

135
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,219
more women in we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more people</font>

136
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,770
from different countries that are

137
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,050
underrepresented or different regions

138
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:11,409
that are underrepresented at the moment

139
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,330
then I think we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> our job and at</font>

140
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,150
this meeting all we have to do select
