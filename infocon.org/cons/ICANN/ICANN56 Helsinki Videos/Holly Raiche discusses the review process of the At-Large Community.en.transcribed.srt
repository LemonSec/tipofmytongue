4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,740
of the working party why is the the

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:23,789
Adler's review such an important project

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:26,630
the work of I can is is it must include

7
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:30,090
the voice of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user and a lack has</font>

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:33,719
that voice from five regions from many

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,760
backgrounds all can contribute good I

10
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,700
understand this is the M the second at

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,849
large review and what makes this this

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">process different to the last one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,430
last one<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first I like</font>

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:51,059
review at that stage<font color="#CCCCCC"> the at large</font>

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:54,480
structures had just barely begun to

16
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:57,360
exist the regional organizations were

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,519
information so clearly they couldn't be

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,090
reviewed well now all the structures in

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,750
place it's time to say is it working

20
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:09,090
good and your motivation to be part of

21
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,350
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this review where does they come</font>

22
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:16,830
from I think I'm a policy junkie I've

23
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,229
had a lot of experience as you know in a

24
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:23,070
lot of the policy work of the genus<font color="#CCCCCC"> o</font>

25
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:27,470
years of who is stuff the transfer

26
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:29,669
policies the consumer trust stuff and I

27
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,548
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a very personal point of view</font>

28
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:38,090
I really want the at-large voice to be

29
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:40,740
heard effectively and understand to be

30
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,229
effective for the review the working

31
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,360
party needs to have a concern amount of

32
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,399
members what would you say to people to

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,110
persuade them to become become a member

a policy background whatever regional

41
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,288
