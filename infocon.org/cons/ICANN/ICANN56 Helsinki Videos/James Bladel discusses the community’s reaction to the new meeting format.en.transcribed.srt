3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,139
with you you express the hope that the

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,059
new policy forum format<font color="#CCCCCC"> we bring a fresh</font>

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:17,890
way that the eyesores and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ACS we did</font>

00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:23,230
delivered yeah David<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks it has it's</font>

8
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:25,689
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little premature to judge but I think</font>

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:29,259
overall it has in fact delivered on that

10
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:31,000
potential I know I've noticed quite a

11
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:33,250
bit of interaction between the various

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,600
SOS and ACS as well as the different

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,870
stakeholder groups and constituencies

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,280
within the gns oh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to get</font>

15
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,530
too far ahead of ourselves but i think

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,839
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy forum for matt has been</font>

17
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,550
a success and<font color="#E5E5E5"> while we may tweak it on</font>

18
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:48,010
the margins going forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's</font>

19
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,718
it's here to stay and is the feedback

20
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,718
from within the community being positive

21
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:55,449
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> positive most of the folks have</font>

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,579
indicated to me at least privately that

23
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:59,679
they felt that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting was more</font>

24
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,600
focused that they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get quite</font>

25
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,460
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> completed and that they</font>

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,370
felt at the same time that it was a

27
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,030
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> relaxed although</font>

28
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,260
paradoxically that they were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

29
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,940
more tired at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> each day</font>

30
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:13,150
because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they were</font>

31
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,649
attending more more<font color="#E5E5E5"> sessions or perhaps</font>

32
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:18,070
that's because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sun just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't go</font>

00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,960

35
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,899
development processes subsequent

procedures RDS and an rpms review how

00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,670
much work<font color="#CCCCCC"> is being accomplished this</font>

38
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:33,910
week can lose<font color="#CCCCCC"> three I think those groups</font>

39
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,980
are also reporting positive feedback

from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this from this format I know that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">in the past</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some PDP working groups have</font>

42
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:44,410
had a full day set aside we obviously

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that ability within the</font>

policy format structure however each of

45
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,090
those groups had dedicated sessions

46
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:55,050
where they were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get quite a bit</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of work completed in fact anecdotally</font>

48
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:01,390
anecdotally one person reported to me

49
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:03,010
that the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those pdps was able to</font>

young the agenda we have a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

to structure itself for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new I can in</font>

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,700
the in the Empowered community and

64
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,519
beyond I think there's quite a bit of

65
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:43,000
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do to implement under the new</font>

66
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,310
bylaws secondly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just heard that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> G</font>

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,530
and s 0 review recommendations were

68
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,020
approved<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the board so we're going to</font>

69
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,960
convene a team to launch the process to

70
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:55,420
implement those first off of course we

71
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,850
need an implementation plan and so we'll

72
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:01,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">put that together in the next in the</font>

73
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:04,570
next few months and finally we are

74
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,429
anticipating that as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we are</font>

75
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,650
concluded here in Helsinki we can begin

76
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,690
planning for meeting see which will be

77
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,300
occurring later this year in Hyderabad

78
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,950
of course I can 57 as you say in

79
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,140
hyderabad india is going to be another

80
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,760
first moving to the new meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> c-format</font>

81
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">can you talk us through your</font>

82
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,870
expectations for that 70 meeting well

83
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,399
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little early obviously we're</font>

84
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,170
looking at a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more time but I</font>

85
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,260
think that that if we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> borrow from</font>

86
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,030
this lessons<font color="#CCCCCC"> from this format it's that</font>

87
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,590
some sessions could benefit from a more

88
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:37,930
focused approach we may see some return

89
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:41,100
of a face-to-face day long session for

90
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:44,860
example for one of the PDP s we may see

91
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:49,600
face-to-face sessions for the CCW<font color="#CCCCCC"> g4</font>

92
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:52,540
work stream<font color="#E5E5E5"> to as well as other features</font>

93
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,120
of meeting see like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to public forums and</font>

94
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,400
and further interaction between the

95
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,080
different SOS and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACS so hopefully we</font>

96
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,120
can take what we've learned in meeting

97
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,980
be and build<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that for meeting scene</font>
