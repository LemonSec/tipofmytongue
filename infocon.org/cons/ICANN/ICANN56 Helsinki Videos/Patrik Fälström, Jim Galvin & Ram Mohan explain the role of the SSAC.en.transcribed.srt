Jim how does the SS conduct its work so

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:08,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">SF is dependent on a set of members who</font>

26
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,070
bring specific skills to the group

27
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:12,810
mostly technical skills for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

28
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,970
part but we are dependent<font color="#E5E5E5"> on people who</font>

29
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,830
bring perspectives from you know other

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,429
disciplines and other topics<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

31
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,500
that certainly are important we expect

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,030
people to be actively engaged and so as

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">SEC will have a topic and an issue that</font>

34
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,110
it wants to address and<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically the</font>

35
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,110
way the work is conducted as a group of

36
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">people will volunteer from within SF to</font>

37
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,789
be a member of a work party which will

38
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,070
then examine that particular topic and

39
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,930
produce a draft document and they'll

40
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,630
typically use teleconferences and

41
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,250
mailing lists through which to do those

42
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,798
<font color="#CCCCCC">things the group will decide for itself</font>

43
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,689
what kind of interactions it needs and

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,490
how to conduct them so we try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

45
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,798
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> flexible about meeting the needs</font>

46
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,929
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> members who are there and then</font>

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,939
once they produce a draft work product

48
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">its distributed to the entire s act to</font>

49
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,839
review since any work product that we

50
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,789
produce you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> really speaks to the</font>

51
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,920
voice of being the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> isaque</font>

52
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">committee and then it goes to another</font>

53
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,628
iteration of review there which you know

54
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">is generally very useful so that folks</font>

55
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,799
who are not knowledgeable in specific

56
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,230
areas have an opportunity to

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,300
review their perspective to what a topic

58
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,640
means to them it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

59
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,410
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hallmark of a sec reports and</font>

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,690
in their ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be complete and</font>

61
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:28,650
thorough and an examination of a topic

62
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:31,530
from from all sides so Ron what is the

63
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,980
role the board liaison the board liaison

64
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:38,460
is has two roles one is to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

65
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,880
the work of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> S</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sac is represented in</font>

66
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">a in an appropriate way to the board and</font>

67
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,290
is able to present to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board some of</font>

68
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,830
the more technical things that we work

69
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,840
on and to also the second thing is to

70
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,640
really participate in the board as a

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:59,010
full-fledged member of the board and

72
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:01,829
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that there is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

73
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,200
instability angle if you will that that

74
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,780
attaches to<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues that otherwise might</font>

75
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,880
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a policy oriented discussion</font>

76
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,430
they finally how does the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sx interact</font>

77
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,890
with the board the<font color="#CCCCCC"> esic has a few</font>

78
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,460
interactions of the board primarily all

79
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,320
of our advice tends to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> addressed to</font>

80
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,970
the board we<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes have advised to</font>

81
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,560
other parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community are the</font>

82
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,980
parts of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet community itself</font>

83
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,040
but most of our documents are written

84
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,950
and sent up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board our members are</font>

85
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,200
appointed by the board and so we have a

86
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:37,850
direct responsibility to the board the

87
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,470
other thing that the SF does is it has

88
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,750
regular meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> face-to-face meetings</font>

89
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,880
of the board and if necessary we have

90
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,340
rearranged for teleconferences as well

91
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:51,239
but most of the times it tends to be in

92
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,040
the presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the work that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font>

93
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,650
the documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we create the</font>

94
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,760
presentation of those to the board well

95
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,330
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for your time when I</font>

96
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,140
hope you enjoy the rest<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the forum</font>

97
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,140
I can thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>
