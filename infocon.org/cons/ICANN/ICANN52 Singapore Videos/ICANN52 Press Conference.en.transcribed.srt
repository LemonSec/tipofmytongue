momentous meeting because the community

evolved and how our community has

00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:43,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">government first on the human side the</font>

44
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:47,859
hundreds of people involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in all the</font>

45
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:50,590
tracks to produce a proposal that

46

<font color="#E5E5E5">addresses the key questions the US</font>

47

government asked in a way that leaves

00:02:52,930 --> 00:03:03,220
everyone comfortable with where we're

49
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:07,420
heading and then on the process side we

50
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:10,030
have shown how I can can bring business

51

government<font color="#E5E5E5"> interests like few</font>

53
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:20,018
organizations can and rapidly build in

54
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:23,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the span of a year multiple tracks of</font>

55
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:28,810
processes that I am confident will

56
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:33,400
produce<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right result I just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

57

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:40,450
morning with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Minister</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Yakub Abraham he</font>

59
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:44,440
was asking me<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the transition and</font>

60
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:47,820
in the process of explaining to<font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font>

61
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:51,940
where we are he simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked me a very</font>

62
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:54,530
direct question he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm very pleased</font>

63
00:03:51,940 --> 00:04:00,400
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the progress but</font>

64
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:03,319
is all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this going to lead us to a</font>

65
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,080
regime that maintains the current

66
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:09,440
stability and security of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the domain</font>

67
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:13,520
name system and of the affairs of I can

68
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:16,608
if that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good otherwise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,440
need some assurance so I gave him the

70
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,539
assurance that and I give you the

71
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,380
assurance that the security and

72
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:28,220
stability<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the system are bigger goals</font>

73
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:31,219
then ending the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US stewardship they are</font>

74
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">our goes from our inception and there</font>

75
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,680
are goals through this phase and there

76
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,640
are goals after<font color="#E5E5E5"> this face so nothing we</font>

77
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:43,490
do should reduce the confidence of the

78
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,770
world in our ability to operationally

79
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:50,360
maintain the security and stability<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

80
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:52,820
the internet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look forward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

81
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,510
week of hard work this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a week of hard</font>

82
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:59,349
work and look forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the global</font>

83
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:02,270
community coming together and advancing

84
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:05,660
the work of the of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition and</font>

85
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:09,890
finally just my job<font color="#E5E5E5"> as CEO does not stop</font>

86
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:13,130
while all of us are quite busy producing

87
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:15,669
the proposal my job as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the CEO is to</font>

88
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:20,150
ensure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the resources of icon and</font>

89

the teams that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supporting the</font>

community are performing our operational

91
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:31,190
functions with excellence so that there

92
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:33,830
will not be in any way or shape or form

93
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:37,400
and need that gradation of our

94
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:41,539
excellence at any time during this busy

95
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:44,989
phase and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm confident from from this</font>

96
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:50,320
my point of view<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are on track to</font>

97
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,320
ensure a stability throughout this face

98
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:58,760
thank you for tea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and um Steve would you</font>

99
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,390
like to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few words as well thank</font>

100
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,390
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much</font>

101
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:10,260
let me echo a couple of points that body

102
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:12,669
has touched on we of course are

103
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:16,390
everyone's attention is focused on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

104
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:18,340
transition<font color="#CCCCCC"> process and the examination</font>

105
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,919
of our accountability processes and so

106
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,560
forth but the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> point the funny</font>

107
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,720
emphasized is absolutely paramount we

108
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,430
have a very substantial organization we

109
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,800
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very substantial mission and</font>

110
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,380
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't come to an absolute halt</font>

111
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,450
just because we're looking at these

112
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:39,280
other issues we have a mission and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

113
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:41,740
carry that out it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a very</font>

114
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,919
substantial and ongoing effort with a

115
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:47,860
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people obviously one element that</font>

116
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:51,160
is relevant to mention here is the

117
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,380
globalization<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can and it's</font>

118
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,920
particularly relevant to focus on it

119
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,780
while we're sitting in Singapore because

120
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,300
Singapore is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the two additional</font>

121
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:05,919
hubs that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> created over time the</font>

122
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:08,200
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones in Istanbul and these hubs</font>

123
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,290
are making a<font color="#CCCCCC"> big difference in our</font>

124
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:15,940
ability to serve the respective

125
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:18,190
communities so in particular we now have

126
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ability to have contracts that are</font>

127
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:23,680
in local languages with local law and

128
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,600
with local currencies as opposed to

129
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,640
everything going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the US these</font>

130
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:33,130
are substantive and very specific

131
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:38,169
changes in our operation all of which

132
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:40,600
are oriented toward the truly

133
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:43,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">globalization and not just talking about</font>

134
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,030
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to thank quick for</font>

135
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:50,170
educating me a bit on what's going on it

136
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:53,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">was very eye-opening the other thing</font>

137
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:55,600
that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to emphasize is that and you</font>

138
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,570
heard from the various leaders of the

139
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,930
other parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ecosystem is that I</font>

140
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,790
can is and will continue to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be part of a</font>

141
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:08,220
larger ecosystem it's not all about I

142
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:11,050
can I particularly liked<font color="#E5E5E5"> iari arcos</font>

143
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,910
diagram that he used that<font color="#E5E5E5"> showed the ITF</font>

144
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,260
it showed I

145
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:17,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">canon and showed other parts of the</font>

146
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:19,469
ecosystem and our commitment has been

147
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:23,700
continues to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we work with others</font>

148
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:26,220
as opposed to being alone these things

149
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,539
won't change during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition that</font>

150
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,830
won't change after the transition

151
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:33,960
they're part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the context that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we live</font>

155
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:48,599

156
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:51,750
is solidly behind the staff and

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,950
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> scholarly is supportive of</font>

159
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">back to the point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where the community</font>

160
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,550
can't tell what the board is doing I had

161
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">previously viewed that as the</font>

162
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,530
appropriate thing we're now considering

163
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,610
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it a little clearer what</font>

164
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:14,150
we're thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're doing</font>

165
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:14,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">but it's it's a well functioning system</font>

166
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:22,140
and I also want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the opportunity</font>

167
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,840
to introduce quack<font color="#CCCCCC"> well who's not on the</font>

168
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:28,020
panel but quite your tongue is the VP

169
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:30,240
and MD for asia-pacific so just in case

170
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:33,030
you might have any questions you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

172
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:40,740
them to him so we would now like to open

173
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:42,870
up for questions and I'll just open it

174

indeed i can hold three such meetings

194
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:44,730
every year since its inception and even

195
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,880
before the transition was on the agenda

196
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,860
we clearly had quite a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on</font>

197
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,900
our plate but to give you a sense of

198
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:57,589
what is happening at this meeting for

199
00:10:51,900 --> 00:11:02,670
example we have a large number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

200
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:05,400
sessions a little north of 300 sessions

bridges<font color="#CCCCCC"> of understanding and discussion</font>

216
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:56,099

call the framework of interpretation

which manages how country codes can be

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can meetings this is an intense</font>

week of work that occurs for policy

00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:26,760
development for advice development and

228
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:29,800
certainly for reviewing the security of

229
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:33,970
the of the domain name system and the

230
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:36,810
identifiers we work in finally just what

231
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:39,880
happens this week is also cross

232
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,890
ecosystem meetings our chairman

233
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,470
mentioned the fact that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

234
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:46,780
of a much larger ecosystem of

235
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,580
organizations most of these

236
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,520
organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> are here they are</font>

237
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,710
represented and so the ecosystem is

238
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,850
large it includes technical

239
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:59,380
organizations like the IETF it includes

240
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">policy-making organizations as well like</font>

241
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,020
to the regional internet registry ap

242
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:07,360
Nick would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one for this region</font>

243
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:09,819
and then other interested parties so for

244
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,890
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> law enforcement officials from</font>

245
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,280
around the world will be here and they

246
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:17,350
will have their own meetings to discuss

247
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:20,740
how law enforcement interacts with the

248
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">domain name system now you know also</font>

249
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:26,020
that in addition to all of that regular

250
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,120
work we do meeting after meeting at this

251
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:31,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular meeting there's quite an</font>

252
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,800
intense set of activities around the

253
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,590
stewardship transition and the

254
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,930
accountability of Ikea so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

255
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">simply reporting on the progress of</font>

256
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,410
these activities<font color="#E5E5E5"> they will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually be</font>

257
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,510
working meetings where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> members of</font>

258
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">these committees will meet and advance</font>

259
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:50,050
the work so that we can meet hopefully

260
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:52,570
the timelines that would keep us within

261
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:58,449
a successful envelope for the transition

262
00:13:52,570 --> 00:14:00,820
does that address your question talk

263
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:03,850
about I mean it seems that what the

264
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:06,420
biggest stumbling block is a political

265
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:09,310
one between governments for for a

266
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:13,150
consensus to be reached right so are

267
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:16,390
there plans for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of meetings of</font>

268
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:17,949
high-level political meetings of<font color="#E5E5E5"> various</font>

269
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,350
governments including the guns<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

270
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,660
opposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the multi-stakeholder process</font>

271
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:24,339
so that you know maybe at g20 or a

272
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">high-level meeting where where this</font>

273
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:30,199
issue is on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the agenda</font>

274
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:33,109
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll answer your question in two</font>

275
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:35,359
parts first of all yes there are many

276
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">high-level meetings that will occur here</font>

277
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,319
we have senior government

278
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,629
representatives and ministers coming

279
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:43,910
from a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> countries and they will</font>

280
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:46,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">be meeting amongst themselves and also</font>

281
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the ICANN leadership to discuss</font>

282
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:53,839
their concerns and their aspirations out

283
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:56,860
of the transition but I want to comment

284
00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:02,179
on the first part of your question I

285
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:04,759
don't think the issue right now is an

286
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:08,059
intergovernmental agreement on the

287
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:12,319
transition<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what is going on now</font>

288
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:14,990
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very straightforward response to</font>

289
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:18,550
the US government's request that we have

290
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:21,230
a true consensus-based open inclusive

291
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,899
multi-stakeholder proposal presented to

292
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,689
them and that takes work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it i</font>

293
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:29,779
don't think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are government</font>

294
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:32,509
standing in the way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transition</font>

295
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:34,579
right now or<font color="#CCCCCC"> governments pushing for the</font>

296
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:38,779
transition I think all governments are

297
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:41,089
engaged and would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see how the</font>

298
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:43,730
community which includes governments by

299
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:45,110
the way we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> crossed community</font>

300
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,449
working groups all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

301
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,459
government representatives and business

302
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:52,279
and civil society<font color="#CCCCCC"> and technical people</font>

303
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:55,309
all engage together to produce these

304
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:59,230
proposals so right now I am quite

305
00:15:55,309 --> 00:16:02,389
confident that some of the blockers

306
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:05,809
because of concerns of security or

307
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:09,259
concerns of capture or concern I think

308
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:11,929
these blockers will slowly fade as good

309
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:14,899
proposals<font color="#CCCCCC"> emerge from the community</font>

310
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:16,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the consensus process so the</font>

311
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:20,709
purpose of these bilateral meetings

312
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:24,679
would be less about convincing anyone

313
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:28,008
one way or the other and<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead they</font>

314
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:30,529
would be meetings to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these</font>

315
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:33,230
governments have full visibility to the

316
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:34,060
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hopefully for participation</font>

317
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,970
in the

318
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:39,550
so at the end we can all stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with</font>

319
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:42,910
confidence and say this was an inclusive

320
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:45,849
legitimate process and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't pass</font>

321
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:48,579
that test the US government<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself said</font>

322
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,740
I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not accept the proposal so</font>

323
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,090
there's a there is a high test here from

324
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,430
the US government themselves that said

325
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:59,440
if this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a consensus proposal if</font>

326
00:16:54,430 --> 00:17:02,439
we have a huge backlash from the

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,980
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself saying this is not the</font>

331
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:24,490
we maintain a neutral constructive role

332
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:27,930
that supports finishing this if you can

00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:34,510
regards to the dtl DC there's been some

controversy about gay then dot the LGBT

337
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,510
that's involved in the kind of

338
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:48,189
challenges that you face in

339
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:52,960
administering this area to talk to thank

340
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:57,720
you for a question and you mention a

341
00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:05,970
couple of specific strings gay and LGBT

342
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:08,670
that touch on a particular topic it's

343
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:13,570
it's actually an extremely positive

344
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:19,060
situation that we face when I can was

345
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:21,580
formed 1998 it was charged with a number

346
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,830
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them was promoting</font>

347
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,860
competition and opening up the domain

00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:30,040
name space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've come at that very</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">carefully and very deliberately one</font>

350
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:37,450
piece of promoting competition was to

351
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:40,150
segregate the separate the registries

352
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:42,700
and create registrar's so that there was

353
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:45,020
competition in the pricing and the sales

354
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,120
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that led to a dramatic opening up</font>

the expansion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main name the</font>

to the top level<font color="#E5E5E5"> domains and we took</font>

quite a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time and we experimented</font>

361
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:06,710
there were some smaller experiments in

<font color="#CCCCCC">the era of 2000 where we wind up</font>

and then to look at specific situations

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,150
where there may need to be some

credentials or professions like doctors

or banks and what happens in this

situation is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we then wind up moving</font>

from a pure engineering situation of

as non-directive as we can and to

provide a forum and maybe in some cases

commercial applications and so there

440
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:19,800
were multiple applicants for<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot gain</font>

441
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:22,139
one of them applied under the much more

442
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:25,409
precise rules of the community

443
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:28,350
application and an independent panel not

444
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:30,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">up to the board</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or I can staff an</font>

445
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:33,209
independent panel that reviewed that

446
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:36,270
application came to the conclusion that

447
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:42,090
this application did not meet the

448
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:45,150
community specific criteria that's all

449
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:46,649
now the applicants can continue with

450
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,230
their application it's just that they

451
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:53,010
will now be competing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with others who</font>

452
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,660
applied<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that string on an equal</font>

453
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,400
footing as opposed to being on a

454
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,890
community level so and<font color="#CCCCCC"> again that was</font>

455
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,320
made by an independent<font color="#E5E5E5"> panel and in no</font>

456
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:04,860
way it reflects a certain social

engineering by<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICANN or bias if in any</font>

458
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:10,340
way this is simply a process and the

00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:10,340
process is<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving forward</font>

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,309
important to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the new GED program</font>

493
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,209
and see what where we are today and

00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:05,110
where we've progressed and we have today

495
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:09,150
signed almost 800 agreements for new

are asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know are these the</font>

500

expected registration levels are it's a

501
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:35,070
program successful the area<font color="#E5E5E5"> I focus on</font>

502
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,899
is that the three goals of the program

503
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:40,240
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning the three goals were</font>

504
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,850
to provide choice and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious that</font>

505
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:48,040
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> having a lot more choice in the</font>

506
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:50,590
domain name system we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

507
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">competition and competition is not only</font>

508
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:56,080
about being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to register a domain</font>

509

name for eight dollars instead of nine

510
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,389
dollars that's not material what's

511
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:03,669
material is that with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the introduction</font>

512
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:06,730
of all of these domain names there are a

513
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:09,160
lot more service providers coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

514
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,590
the ecosystem which means there are a

515
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:15,010
lot more email providers coming in

516
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:17,830
hosting providers coming in web

517
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:21,070
developers coming into the space with

518
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:23,350
all of these incoming resources that are

519
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:25,870
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come to this the the domain</font>

520
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,939
name area and compete in this market

521
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:30,580
we're going to see more competitive

522
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:34,030
landscape and therefore the ownership of

523
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:36,580
a website<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a domain name is going to</font>

524
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:38,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">get more competitive and that's what we</font>

525
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,899
what the program is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it's not about</font>

526
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:43,240
just having a name for cheaper by one

527
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:45,370
dollar or fifty cents it's about

528
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,350
actually being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to have a presence</font>

529
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:50,050
on the internet that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot more</font>

530
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:53,260
competitive therefore reaching out to a

531
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:55,180
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the areas where you know we call</font>

532
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,340
an underdeveloped or whatever but

533
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,320
reaching out to these areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> and making</font>

534
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,510
having a presence on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet a lot</font>

535
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,610
more competitive a lot more affordable I

536
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:06,010
think that's key to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> secret to the</font>

537
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,870
program and we're gonna see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's</font>

538
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:10,360
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time this program is</font>

539
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:11,889
not about how my registration do we get

540
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,080
in the first month of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> launch of a</font>

541
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:16,570
TLD it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going to happen 5</font>

542
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,879
10 20 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> from now this program is</font>

543
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,110
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet it's the way the</font>

544
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look</font>

545
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:24,820
and 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> years from now and the last but</font>

546
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:27,100
not least is the innovation on the

547
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,049
internet and this is happening as well I

548
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:32,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're seeing a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of new</font>

549
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:36,490
business models in the domain name

550
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:39,100
system we're seeing a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tlds come</font>

551
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:41,290
up with innovative ideas on how to be

552
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:44,500
present<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet but the key</font>

553
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:47,470
focus i think is when two brands or the

554
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">the yes brands come out with their</font>

555
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:51,520
domain names because that's where

556
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:53,080
they're going to represent themselves in

557
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,580
a different way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

558
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:59,199
to see a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of innovation in that space</font>

559
00:28:54,580 --> 00:29:01,510
and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GOS we've seen a lot of</font>

560
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,350
innovation there where cities are now

561
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:09,640
having an identity online so so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

562
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:11,320
new this was not didn't exist before and

563
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,080
we look forward forgotten for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

564
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:18,280
innovation in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> years to come so</font>

565
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:20,409
basically i think that the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld</font>

566
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,580
program is successful it's happening

567
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:25,690
it's it's taking this new course and

568
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:30,699
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of benefits</font>

569
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:32,320
from it in the future thank you I'm type

570
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,900
of gold stay not right for a few blogs

571
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:39,520
on domain name issues I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

572
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:41,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">top guy issue and there was a panel</font>

573
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,970
decision recently is was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right that</font>

574
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,340
there was an overturning of a decision

575
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:47,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">or is it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the review</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the decision</font>

576
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:50,350
but just following on from that it's

577
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:53,559
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been somewhat controversial</font>

578
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:55,389
and not focusing specifically on<font color="#E5E5E5"> dr. are</font>

579
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:57,610
there lessons lessons do you think that

at something<font color="#E5E5E5"> but on the panel decision</font>

overturned the applicant the applicant

00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:51,100
exercised one of our accountability

597
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:52,919
mechanisms and the board the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board</font>

598
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:57,040
committee that looks at these things

599
00:30:52,920 --> 00:31:00,160
decided that there was a mistake in the

600
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:02,740
performance in certain aspect of the

601
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:08,860
performance of the evaluation that it

602
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:12,370
required the provider of the CP to

603
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:15,520
actually read look at the at the CP so

604
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:18,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically it yeah the community</font>

605
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:23,500
evaluation process so basically the

606
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:27,370
board<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked the the provider to set a</font>

00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:31,240
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> panel and review the gay application</font>

608
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:34,600
for this for CP that decision has not

609
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,970
been finalized yet we might see the same

610
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,040
outcome that we had before we might see

611
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:41,970
a different outcome we would have to

612
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:47,649
wait and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what the panel design zone</font>

613
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:53,470
regarding<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community applications I</font>

614
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:57,490
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it is the bar was set high by</font>

615
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:58,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">the community on when somebody says that</font>

616
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,900
this application is the community

617
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:03,880
application how to evaluate it because

618
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:07,750
there was in the community in the

619
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,940
community belief that the gaming that

620
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,950
gaming could happen and if the bar was

621
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:14,050
very low then<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody will apply as a</font>

622
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:17,140
community and therefore now there is no

623
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:20,940
advantage so so they set up the process

624
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:23,050
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the variation to be to a high bar</font>

625
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:28,270
therefore making it harder for

626
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:31,379
applicants to game the system now if if

627
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:33,700
you in hindsight you might look and say

628
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:38,710
there should be a better process than

629
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:40,100
this to help communities be able to

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the review process that we're going</font>

hopefully a better second round that

<font color="#CCCCCC">will hone it and provide a better</font>

you I'm I'd also like tonight<font color="#E5E5E5"> value what</font>

643
00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:33,610
your attitude to domain harbors was at

644
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:38,120
the moment whew I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

645
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:40,990
statement I made in a different to a

different media outlet<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that was</font>

647
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:51,080
conflated to signify that I was

00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:53,450
including in this all those who are in

649
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:58,010
the domain name business<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's not</font>

650
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:59,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">true there are those that do this as a</font>

651
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:02,390
business and do it very<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and</font>

652
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:05,210
actually enhance the market and there

653
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:07,549
are those that do it and actually make

654
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:11,629
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> market less</font>

655
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:14,960
attractive and less really desirable so

656
00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:20,989
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

657
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:23,300
any insinuation that that statement kind

of engulfs everyone that is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:46,969
where we stand and I think we we

667
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:48,740
continue to feel good about how the

686
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:57,029
point was that in fact those things go

687
00:35:54,390 --> 00:36:00,240
together as opposed to being in

688
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:03,150
opposition to each other and that taking

689
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,759
too long to do something may get you a

690
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:11,430
bad result as opposed to a good result

691
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:16,590
of a late result you mean the there is

00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:08,759
coincides with the expiration current

727
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,810
expiration of the contract I think

728
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:17,160
that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful target</font>

729
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:19,049
time people work to deadlines

730
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">governments even work to deadlines I</font>

731
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:24,690
think that is an important date to keep

732
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:26,700
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind if we fail to have something on</font>

733
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:30,590
the stroke of midnight on September 30

734
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:33,210
if the world will not come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an end but</font>

735
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:35,700
but we should also not just say well

736
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:39,600
casually therefore we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have no no time so</font>

737
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:45,750
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a an important time frame</font>

738
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:49,680
to keep in mind a second question again

739
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:52,440
it's for you Steve she's asking if you

740
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:57,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">can give an update on where I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

741
00:38:52,440 --> 00:39:00,510
go with ewg and who is Nick's I'm sorry

742
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,670
I missed one<font color="#CCCCCC"> little piece</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that where</font>

743
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:06,210
I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> will go with respect to with</font>

744
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:09,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">respect to e WT o-- ewg excuse me thank</font>

745
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:12,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">you so there will be some I think there</font>

746
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:17,160
will be some careful briefings of this

747
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:22,440
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are headed to a policy development</font>

748
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:25,580
process in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the gns oh we have</font>

749
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:32,670
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> very deliberate about this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font>

750
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:34,490
as Monica I know knows well the we had

751
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:37,050
the expert working group deliver an

752
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:40,770
extremely thorough and excellent report

753
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:43,890
we have been now taking our time to look

754
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:47,430
at what issues need to be resolved and

755
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:50,160
when do they need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be resolved we will</font>

756
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:52,710
move forward toward a policy development

757
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,190
process and let me give a look past that

758
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:56,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> output of that will lead to a set of</font>

759
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,820
recommendations

760
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:01,520
dations for implementation but we'll

761
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:05,780
leave still plenty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> room for doing</font>

762
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:08,150
more careful work on some of the very

763
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:10,400
detailed<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them engineering</font>

764
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:12,890
oriented issues of how do you structure

765
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,400
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and what are various</font>

766
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:18,080
contingencies and so forth so I'm

767
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">expecting that we will move</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forward</font>

768
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,310
toward a policy development process I

769
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:24,350
don't want to be specific here about

770
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:27,020
exact dates and timelines button but

771
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:29,060
this is getting continuing attention

772
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:32,030
it's probably worth mentioning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

773
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,650
is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example of the kinds</font>

774
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:37,130
of things that fatty and I were alluding

775
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:39,980
to that transition issues are of course

776
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:41,450
occupying much of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention but this</font>

777
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,760
is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big things for example</font>

778
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:45,919
that has been and will<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

779
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,020

political window to open for 16 years

787
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:20,870
IRA Magaziner said that they expected

788
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:25,640
that this contract between<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:41,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that political windows are very fragile</font>

793
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:43,220
and they're fickle very there are a lot

794
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:47,480
of factors<font color="#CCCCCC"> that affect these political</font>

795
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:50,540
windows I think our Chairman's point

796
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:54,380
that from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> practical standpoint we've</font>

797
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:57,470
had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year this almost and we if we need</font>

798
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:59,810
a few more months we have them because

799
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:02,779
as he said there is the world will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:05,509
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an end on sep tember 30th having</font>

801
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,660
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what factors</font>

802
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:11,070
could affect the pool

no mistake we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the most</font>

powerful political tool to kill

something is to simply delay it so we're

868
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:48,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question about the perceived apathy</font>

869
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:52,400
towards the process in some ways is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

870
00:45:48,799 --> 00:45:53,960
signal of the kind of trust they have in

871
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,930
the internet video<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been experienced</font>

872
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,940
were experiencing for so long for<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

873
00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:00,799
Singaporeans who start that day by

874
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,359
checking email looking at whatsapp

875
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:05,509
messages or checking their Facebook

876
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:07,430
updates at the back<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their minds they</font>

877
00:46:05,509 --> 00:46:10,009
are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning that day by thinking</font>

878
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:12,618
hmm I wonder the domain name system is

879
00:46:10,009 --> 00:46:15,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to work today hmm i wonder if i</font>

880
00:46:12,619 --> 00:46:17,779
can is getting its updates to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns</font>

881
00:46:15,049 --> 00:46:19,550
right or wrong so in some ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

882
00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:23,150
we are victims

883
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:25,910
our own success I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think another way of</font>

884
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:29,080
looking at this is that with companies

885
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:32,509
and governments and different bodies

886
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:34,400
putting increased investments in the

887
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:39,290
Internet of Things and in cloud

888
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:41,810
technologies again they are making

889
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:44,210
assumptions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future that the</font>

890
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:47,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet as we know it is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

891
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:50,080
continue so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also a way</font>

892
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:52,670
of answering the question why<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font>

893
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:55,910
important to Singapore why is this

894
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:58,250
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the region simply because</font>

895
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:59,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are banking on the fact that where we</font>

896
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:01,910
wake up<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the morning were able to get</font>

897
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:03,740
our email we're banking on the fact that

898
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:06,109
the investments on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet of</font>

899
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:09,680
Things and cloud technologies are going

900
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:14,690
to work and if we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bank on</font>

901
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:16,879
these it is important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to be</font>

902
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:21,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">involved in the discussion to make sure</font>

903
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:25,220
that we engineer a check future that is

904
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:28,850
set up for success so I I think this in

905
