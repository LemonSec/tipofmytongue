00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:37,869
multi-stakeholder bottom-up approach is

32
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:40,419
unique and is important and as we grew

33
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:44,169
from a hundred twenty hundred thirty

34
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:46,359

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,259
finally of course it is important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us</font>

41
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:05,079
to measure our progress against the

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,280
and ensure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are all focused on</font>

54

the measurements that allow us to

<font color="#E5E5E5">together to agree how i can is</font>

56
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:45,470
performing needless to say another major

57
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,930
area of focus in 2015 has to do with the

58
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,850
stewardship transition the stewardship

61
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:59,390
immensely busy to Shepherd the processes

62
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will allow us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to present the US</font>

government with a proposal that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

64
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,010
meet their criteria I cannot tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

65
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:11,600
how important it is for us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this</font>

66
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:14,989
right to get this right means that we do

67
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,880
it together we leverage the full

68
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:20,690
consensus of the community to deliver

69
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,570
the right proposal and that frankly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

70
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:26,660
process keeps us cohesive as a community

71
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:30,230
and ensures that the world sees that I

72
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,850
can is ready and is prepared to actually

73
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:35,600
meet the challenges of an independent

<font color="#CCCCCC">organization I must tell you also that</font>

75
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,329
getting this right is important for the

76
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:44,390
multi-stakeholder model I can after all

77
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:48,380
is the organization that many look at

78
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:51,200
