4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,030
there was a lot of uncertainty whether

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,190
the community would come<font color="#E5E5E5"> together at</font>

this meeting over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IANA stewardship</font>

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,180
accountability measures now that the

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,729
week is over is the community coalescing

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,320
or is it still pretty far apart well the

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,480
community is definitely coalescing one

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,099
of the great things<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the icam</font>

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,650
meetings that we hold is that it

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,780
provides<font color="#E5E5E5"> an opportunity to bring people</font>

15
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:39,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">together face-to-face and there's</font>

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:42,690
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> as helpful in reducing distance</font>

17
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:45,149
and uncertainty as having all of the

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:49,309
interactions face to face some informal

19
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:51,480
meetings and plenty along the side so

20
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:53,070
it's quite evident you talk to any

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,968
<font color="#CCCCCC">number of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have been progress</font>

22
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:00,570
along the way views that are strongly

23
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:03,480
held to get exchanged and then they get

24
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,309
ironed out and it's sorted out<font color="#E5E5E5"> buddy is</font>

that your perception as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely</font>

them together around core issues so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

we accomplished a lot and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we now</font>

what's dominating you are thinking in

71
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:18,150
this week we have heard our board

collectively say that we're willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

73
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:25,049
go as far as being removed or recall if

certain key conditions and performance

discussion this week<font color="#E5E5E5"> about new Mecca</font>

sounds pretty threatening to me not

90
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:10,310
really it turns out that our board our

processes we have do they work smoothly

106
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,539
we are for example paying very close

107
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,280
attention to whether or not we are

anticipating implementing some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

kinds of things that we're hearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

124
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:38,630
in to add new mechanisms or to adjust

so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this isn't some piece of territory</font>

that we're hanging on to this is a in

129
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:51,470
our stewardship of I can and we want to

130
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,570
leave the institution in a stronger

131
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,760
position than we left it then we came

132
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,530
what came at you during this meeting

133
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,930
just the community have confidence in

the board is not as visible as they

would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> which frankly is</font>

139
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:16,780
a consequence of us actually trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

make some adjustments share more about

00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:40,180
what goes on behind the scenes which is

149
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:43,529
not as deep or complicated as people

150
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:46,060
might think the real decisions the real

151

00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,779
have the board take the lead on but

00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">people still want to know what's going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">on it would find ways to bring all that</font>

ourselves with too much introspection

about the accountability of the

165
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,039
accountability holders did he inject a

166
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:28,960
new line of thinking in an equation

167
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:31,899
absolutely and again let's be clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

168
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,520
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> professor Schulte was just noting</font>

169
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:36,879
that these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of mechanisms</font>

170
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:41,049
and measures that give the world

that are independent<font color="#E5E5E5"> we must have</font>

in performing the functions of iono

179
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:05,439

at this meetings opening ceremony the

about their respective organizations

including the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NRO the ASO I ietf why did</font>

194
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:53,440
we do that because I can needs to play

195
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:56,680
its full role as the coordinator of the

196

unique identifiers in the system these

197
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,680
are independent groups and bodies that

198
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:05,079
make policies some of them part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

eye candy Co system of this completely

200
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:11,620
independent and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> marvelous</font>

201
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:15,189
constellation of how the Internet has

202
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:18,010
been designed where we are a polycentric

203
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,930
model as we say we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have</font>

204
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,580
everything controlled by a center quite

205
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,280
the opposite just like the internet its

206
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,650
governance must be distributed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> poly</font>

207
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,720
centered and on Monday<font color="#CCCCCC"> morning we saw</font>

208
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:32,620
that we saw how the policies come from

209
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,890
the IETF and they come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CC NSO</font>

210
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:38,800
and the gns oh and the ASO and an arrow

211
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:41,949
and how all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these get coordinated at</font>

212
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:46,150
I can but not controlled directly by<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

213
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:48,640
can they have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy mechanisms that</font>

214
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:51,970
are community-based and we wanted on

215
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:55,990
Monday morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give that visual that</font>

216
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:58,120
picture in practice of hi how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can was</font>

217
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,910
always designed from the beginning to be

218
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,209
the coordinator of the ecosystem not the

219
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,410
center of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecosys</font>

220
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:06,899
stevia viously come from a technical

221
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,060
background was it nice for you to see

222
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:13,440
the technical community being put up

223

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,480
reasons the thought he said and it

225
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,250
provided for the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

228
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:27,689
from those segments and learn a little

00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:30,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than they might have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> understood</font>

230
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:33,149
before it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> gathering of old friends</font>

231
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:36,709
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get together they you know we</font>

234
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:47,639
own set of issues that deals with but

235
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:50,100
this is a comfortable cooperative

236
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:52,170
gathering but as fatty said with a

237
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:56,279
tremendous<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of independence of</font>

238
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:59,939
action and distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> of control so</font>

239
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:02,370
that nobody has is sitting in a pinnacle

240
