00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:09,190
we're here with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thomas rickard at one of</font>

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:12,309
the co-chairs of the CC WG Thomas it's

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,480
been a busy 2016 for you so far tell us

4
00:00:12,309 --> 00:00:15,969
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work that you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been involved</font>

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're right 2016 has been crazy busy</font>

6
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:20,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cross community working group on</font>

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:23,020
enhancing icons accountability has been

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:27,070
meeting quite frequently so we had over

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:29,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">200 meetings with almost 14,000 emails</font>

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,270
exchanged<font color="#CCCCCC"> or various lists so it's been</font>

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,950
not only been busy for the co-chairs but

12
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,620
also for the community which I applaud

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,990
for this for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> achievement you know</font>

14
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,390
we came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with a very cohesive report</font>

15
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,770
that went through several iterations of

16
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,989
public comment so we've constantly

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,700
improved it and now we're good to ship

18
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:49,059
it to the ICANN board which will then

19
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,430
hopefully pass it on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia describe</font>

20
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,470
this task<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe working with this</font>

21
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,200
group in what it's been like it's a

22
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,540
difficult task an important one correct

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,820
I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more we're working in a</font>

24
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,129
multi-stakeholder environment so unlike

25
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,680
in a corporation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has shareholders</font>

26
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:08,620
we have stakeholders which have a huge

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,990
you know a huge amount of different

28
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,560
views on how<font color="#E5E5E5"> things should be in i Ken</font>

29
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:16,630
and we had more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 170 individuals</font>

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,700
working in our group with diverse

31
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,589
background so we had government

32
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,869
representatives we had industry

33
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">representatives all sorts of industry</font>

34
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:28,479
representatives intellectual property

35
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,729
advocates business user representatives

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,840
registry registrar representatives

37
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:36,970
private users representation represented

38
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,250
in that group so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> all had their</font>

39
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,560
views<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what what the enormous task</font>

40
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,750
was is to get them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a consensus</font>

41
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,580
position of what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can should look like</font>

42
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,710
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> post transition environment it's</font>

43
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,270
quite a testament to the

44
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,939
multi-stakeholder model when you have

45
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:54,850
that degree of diversity yes and I guess

46
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:57,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a success in itself we're ready</font>

47
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,048
with our report<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully it's going to</font>

48
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,090
be approved by the chartering

49
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:03,400
organizations and hopefully it's going

50
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,829
to be passed on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA this Thursday</font>

51
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,509
while we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Marrakech what's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">our control but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that it's a</font>

54
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:14,649
victory for the multi-stakeholder model

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,640
and I can to prove<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this diverse</font>

56
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,400
group can come

up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cohesive report with real</font>
