very moving with partners prime movers

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:16,070
all over the world as exhibited

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:17,810
exemplified by our<font color="#CCCCCC"> host here this is</font>

00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:21,619
what makes the internet work this is

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:25,788
what makes a global community and it is

00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:29,600
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you share the same feelings i</font>

00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:33,580
have the same things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

us and motivate us to be involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

9
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:41,030
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> i should also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add a word of</font>

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:44,840
appreciation as well to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font>

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:48,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">we don't name and give honorific titles</font>

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:52,340
to who do all the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was flashing</font>

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,089
back to a time about 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago when i</font>

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:01:01,520
put a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into helping organize a</font>

15
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:03,350
meeting in 1985 and the amount of work

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">that goes in behind the scenes is</font>

17
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:09,049
absolutely incredible meetings all the

18
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:10,610
time or a continuous basis and then

19
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:13,909
holding your breath to make sure that

20
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:17,570
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pieces come together so personal</font>

21
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:20,060
thanks to the host to the sponsors and

22
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:23,869
to the to echo the words<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've</font>

23
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:26,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">just heard to all of the teams of people</font>

24
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:28,759
and its multitude of teams it's not just

25
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,729
one set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people it's not just a small</font>

26
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,950
set that take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of every element of</font>

27
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:36,200
making it possible for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

28
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:39,610
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,610
do here<font color="#E5E5E5"> today so thank you again</font>

30
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,140
well it was mentioned that this guy

31
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,850
named chehade is going to leave pretty

32
00:01:52,140 --> 00:02:00,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">soon I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes us all quite sad</font>

33
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,158
actually so while we welcome in a new

34
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,459
era we think I man who's been

35
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,020
instrumental making<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of this happen</font>

36
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:09,899
it's been quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ride I have to say</font>

37
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:13,349
again personally this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is fadi chehade is</font>

38
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,390
last I can meeting as a CEO it's not

39
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">really an understatement to say that he</font>

40
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,708
has transformed I can to a degree that

41
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:22,260
no one imagined possible when he first

42
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:24,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">came on board almost four years ago and</font>

43
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,380
let me make that let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me emphasize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

44
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:31,380
personally he often refers to me as his

45
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,630
boss which I always had kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have a</font>

46
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,280
smile because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that it's</font>

47
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,540
possible to keep up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it much less be</font>

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">in charge of him but I have had the</font>

49
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,078
privilege of having a front-row seat and

50
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:49,108
and pretty good access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> him even</font>

51
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:51,239
though he runs at light speed and the

52
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:54,660
earliest conversations that I had with

53
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,670
him as he<font color="#E5E5E5"> came on board as here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

54
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,980
situation we're in it I can we have we

55
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,780
have started in 1998 there's a small

56
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,690
detail that we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> contract with the</font>

57
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:08,639
US government see if you can do

58
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:10,109
something about that had no idea the

59
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,680
kinds of things that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to come</font>

60
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:15,870
from that and I try to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as broadly</font>

61
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,959
and out of the boxes i can and i still

62
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:22,940
have been surprised in a very positive

63
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,680
sense Julie it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been extraordinary and</font>

64
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,269
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all so I have a list of</font>

65
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,239
accomplishments which I'm obliged to go

66
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,470
through he oversaw the largest-ever

67
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,540
expansion of the domain name system by

68
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,450
implementing the new generic top-level

69
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,280
domains program yes that had been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

70
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">works for several years but the</font>

71
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,599
execution of it was challenging

72
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:47,069
nonetheless and we have pulled<font color="#E5E5E5"> it off</font>

73
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:48,660
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell you that even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> though he</font>

74
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:50,310
spends almost all of his time on

75
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,040
airplanes he still managed to get some

76
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done at home and this took quite</font>

77
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,250
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work</font>

78
00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:00,130
he's made us a truly international

79
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:03,550
organization instituted the concept of

80
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:06,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we call tricorders sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Smashing</font>

81
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:08,710
our headquarters in 23 and opening up

82
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:11,880
hubs in Singapore in Istanbul in

83
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:15,460
addition to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the existing Los Angeles hub</font>

84
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,589
to be fair they are not yet totally

85
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,170
symmetric and balanced but we're getting

86
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:24,489
there and a set a direction that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

87
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:27,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vital for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our mindset and our</font>

88
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,780
operation in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming years and in</font>

89
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,690
addition to these hubs we have

90
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:35,320
engagement centers all over the world

91
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:37,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I expect more to come and yet living</font>

92
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,710
within our resources I expect it will be

93
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:43,270
a balanced operation that takes care of

94
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,940
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happening at</font>

95
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,940
breakneck speed on a day-to-day basis

96
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:52,170
he's all fur coats also oversaw the

97
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:54,910
formation of a five-year strategic plan

98
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,610
give me that translates<font color="#E5E5E5"> into stability</font>

99
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,940
and resilience for both I can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

100
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:03,100
DNS the bottom line is that he didn't

101
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,700
just expand the organization but<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

102
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,890
oversaw its maturation the list of

103
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,810
accomplishments goes on and on but

104
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,630
perhaps the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most valuable contribution</font>

105
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,970
to this organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that</font>

106
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,010
does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit easily into a recitation</font>

107
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,760
like this or on to powerpoint slides

108
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:24,010
he's brought humility and passion<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I</font>

109
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,570
can in a remarkable manner and he's

110
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,510
framed it with a sense of human decency

111
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:31,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is simply unmatched what I'm</font>

112
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:34,390
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> now is not fatty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the CEO</font>

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,430
but Fadi the man like to show you a

114
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,419
brief video that I believe captures

115
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,419
vaghti the man
