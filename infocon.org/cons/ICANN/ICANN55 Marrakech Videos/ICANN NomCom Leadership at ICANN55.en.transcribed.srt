remind everyone that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> calm is</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that expertise into the process and we</font>

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,279
select two key leadership positions

00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:53,710
which my colleagues will detail but on

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,080

and at this meeting in Marrakech at

22
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:04,390
ICANN 55 we're in the middle of our

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:07,960
cycles so we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking to fine-tune</font>

24
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:11,350
our process for selecting those people

25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,199
and we are anticipating the end of the

26
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:17,520
application period where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will then</font>

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,200
have to start fine-tuning selecting

<font color="#E5E5E5">shortlisting and determining our final</font>

slate of selectees hans could you

30
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,590
elaborate on what Stefan just talked

31
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">about where exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are we in this</font>

32
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,970
process well we're still receiving

33
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,650
applications and doing outreach so this

34
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:35,229
meeting is very important to do outreach

35
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">chair and the deadline</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> applications</font>

36
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:39,370
which is very important for those of you

37
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:41,920
who want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to apply is the twentieth of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">March so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still have some days before</font>

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,350
you have filled in your application

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,539
where are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we at just give us a sense of</font>

41
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,089
where we're at in terms of the

42
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,700
application request forms well so far we

43
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:58,450
have a bit less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 applications</font>

44
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:01,180
come in and remembering that it was

45
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,860
women's day yesterday should bear in

46
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,830
mind that it's eight times as many men

47
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,769
as women so there is a big chance here

48
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:12,579
for women to increase the pool for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us as</font>

49
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:14,469
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also around fifteen percent</font>

50
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:15,879
of the applicants come from Africa so

51
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,560
since we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Africa this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

52
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,840
good opportunity

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,489
unity to increase the number of

54
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,739
applicants from this company so

55
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:24,840
basically what I'm hearing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is is</font>

56
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,819
this as an opportunity to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that</font>

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,190
we have diversity yes that's very

58
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,810
assured there's inclusivity yes so

59
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,510
diversity on the board is a very very

60
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,370
important thing to us Wolfgang what sort

61
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,950
of outreach efforts is not common volved

62
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:42,000
in yes as<font color="#E5E5E5"> unspayed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just said diversity</font>

63
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:44,579
is one thing but global representation

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,150
in icon is extremely important and so

65
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:51,150
our outreach activities was aimed around

66
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,959
the globe on all continents we had

67
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:58,019
around 22 outreach events and all five

68
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,080
regions of the world we use conferences

69
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:04,019
where we make statements or organized

70
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:08,459
small meetings to explain how no

71
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:12,060
converts we roadblocks and you know used

72
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:15,450
mailing lists to reach to out to as many

73
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:19,470
people as possible and again from around

74
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:22,440
the globe so I'm very happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

75
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:25,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">got now already some good candidates</font>

76
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,450

<font color="#CCCCCC">Marsha 20th which is when we cut off our</font>

90
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,950
determine that there's a short list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

91
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,410
applicants that we will call up either

92
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:10,819
for direct face-to-face interviews or

93
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,410
telephone interviews or we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> email</font>

94
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:16,108
there'll be some kind of contact between

95
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:19,019
us and them to understand who they are

96
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:22,580
and whether they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right fit for</font>

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,960
the positions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are recruiting to</font>

touch on something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would that was</font>

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,340
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier noncom is really at</font>

the heart of making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

can<font color="#E5E5E5"> has diversity from all around the</font>

102
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,429
world and inclusivity right yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

103
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,669
absolutely right we are here to

104
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:43,740
supplement other I can processes that

105
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:45,930
strive at diversity<font color="#CCCCCC"> and diversity can</font>

106
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,110
take many forms you have a diverse

107
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:52,290
leadership team here in front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you in</font>

108
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of geography but obviously not</font>

109
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">very diverse in terms of gender now</font>

110
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,870
that's probably an accident this year we

111
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,660
had last year what the year before we

112
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:07,830
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> woman chairing the nominating</font>

113
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:12,180
committee but we think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be</font>

114
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:14,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">diverse to represent and project that to</font>

115
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:19,070
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to recruit</font>

116
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:22,650
to the noncom at the moment is mostly

117
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:25,469
male in terms of its membership and I

118
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:28,109
should stress that the members we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

119
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,180
non-voting the leadership team and hans

120
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,630
petter<font color="#CCCCCC"> chair-elect and myself as chair</font>

121
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,870
are chosen by the ICANN board<font color="#E5E5E5"> wolfgang</font>

122
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:39,900
is chosen by the chair so in this

123
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:43,350
instance I chose<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wolfgang and the reason</font>

124
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">for this three-man leadership team is to</font>

125
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:48,300
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have perfect</font>

126
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:52,590
succession planning so the sitting chair

127
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,690
has the duty of training the chair elect

128
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:58,229
so that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chair</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> elec can take their</font>

129
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:01,320
duty next year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's helped by the</font>

130
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:03,870
associate chair Wolfgang as a past ICANN

131
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,789
board member he was non compare so he

132
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,520
brings a lot of experience to that

133
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:11,969
process but the members<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the committee</font>

134
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,669
are elected or<font color="#E5E5E5"> chosen by the community</font>

135
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:17,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it's up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the community to make sure</font>

136
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:20,520
the nominating committee is diverse it's

137
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:23,400
then up to the applicants to make sure

138
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,500
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to select from a diverse</font>

139
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,810
pool of candidates because we cannot

140
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,389
select someone obviously that has not

141
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:32,490
applied we are dependent on those that

142
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,470
apply for our selections so it's all

143
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the future you've planned for the</font>

144
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:40,110
future with your succession planning

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,830
you're looking at potential picks for

146
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,780
diversity it's all about looking ahead

147

that's absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

148
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:48,130
looking ahead with the processes as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

149
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,260
so what we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do for example</font>

150
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:54,219
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my colleagues have mentioned</font>

151
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:56,590
outreach we're now as the date of the

152
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,200
the deadline for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application period</font>

153
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:01,390
is drawing to a close there's obviously

154
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">limited outreach that we can do for this</font>

155
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,650
year but we're continuing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do outreach</font>

156
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,270
and to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> others for</font>

157
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,429
example to explain what we're doing

158
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:12,099
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also important for future</font>

159
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,110
noncoms and hans petter is dependent on

160
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,360
this for his work next year and the

161
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,610
people that will follow us in the years

162
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,190
to come will also be dependent<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font>

163
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,140
so we're looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> making sure that we</font>

00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,450
have a good track for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future as well</font>
