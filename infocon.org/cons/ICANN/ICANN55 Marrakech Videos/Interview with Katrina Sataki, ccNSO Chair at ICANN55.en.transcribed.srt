5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:21,480
for the CC NSO well I hope it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,250
bright of course the season or so and

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,820
the decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Council in</font>

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:30,509
particular should continuously listen to

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,809
the ccTLDs and I use ccTLDs here

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,360
deliberately because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> season is so is</font>

11
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,540
much well it is a membership

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:43,800
organization yes and not all ccTLDs are

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:47,610
members of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> season is so we have only</font>

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,190
50 what two-thirds of our ccTLDs are

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,969
basically our members of the season<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:57,449
but the season is always open to every

17
00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:02,010
any ccTLD around the world if you're a

18
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:05,009
ccTLD you are welcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come during our</font>

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,070
sessions join our working groups provide

20
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,040

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">ccso Bible let's let's talk about that</font>

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,200
for a second why should they join what

24
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,020
do you what does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the table</font>

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,720
for them to join well it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

26
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,630
possibility to exchange information of

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,369
course if we talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ccTLDs then</font>

28
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,899
we have very strong regional

29
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:33,150
organizations and ccTLDs of course come

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,079
together in in their regions and they

31
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,549
discuss things in season and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we can</font>

32
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">discuss things well first of all we can</font>

33
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:45,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">exchange information between regions but</font>

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,270
the same time we want talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

35
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that mean more important things</font>

36
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,250
that that concern all the ccTLDs and

37
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,470
reading organizations are part of these

38
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,090
discussions and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> always take active</font>

39
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,189
part more important things like what

40
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,689
forgive us an example yeah well for

41
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:06,329
example or if we talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> off I think</font>

42
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:08,340
we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that recently this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iono</font>

43
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:12,230
stewardship transition being on the

44
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:15,860
table for them I know it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what</font>

45
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:18,590
forever but but this is something of

46
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,290
course it'sit's discussed within ccTLDs

47
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,180
is discussed within the regional

48
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,548
organizations but but when they come

49
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,549
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we discuss things we</font>

50
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:31,430
probably it together we can make much

51
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:37,730
bigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> impact on all the things plus</font>

52
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:40,280
another policy related work like oh yeah

53
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:44,060
for example a policy development process

54
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,180
on retirement of ccTLDs were delegation

55
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:51,200
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cct of these it's it's important for</font>

56
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:54,410
ccTLDs and yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CC and so is a</font>

57
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,750
platform where we can come together when

58
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,010
it gets full support from our season saw

59
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,840
secretariat and its really very

60
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:04,879
important we have wonderful people

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:07,940
working there they<font color="#E5E5E5"> they support each and</font>

62
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,620
every ccTLD around the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it</font>

63
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,660
sounds like what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying is if all</font>

64
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,569
the ccTLDs can come together share

65
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,099
information even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they don't reach</font>

66
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,810
agreement on something every puts

67
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:19,340
everybody on the same page right yeah

68
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,139
well it so you can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like that I</font>

69
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:25,639
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a what the fair assessment</font>

70
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:28,690
and yes but ccTLDs I think that's a

71
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:31,459
strange animal and anyway we're really

72
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:36,410
we do not compete with each other in

73
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:38,840
most cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway and that makes us what</font>

74
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:42,109
for so nice to each other and sharing

75
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,609
sharing and caring of them that's worth

76
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:45,680
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah that's great so you can learn</font>

77
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:47,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">from each other absolutely that's what</font>

78
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,980
we did that's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good Katrina thank</font>
