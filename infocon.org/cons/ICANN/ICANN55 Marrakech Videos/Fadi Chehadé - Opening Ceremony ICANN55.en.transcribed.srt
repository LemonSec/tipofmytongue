145
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:14,159
the house so he<font color="#E5E5E5"> came and picked me from</font>

147

highway between<font color="#CCCCCC"> Beirut</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Damascus and</font>

148
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:24,120
he stopped the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> Laurie he found he</font>

149
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,559
told him take my son to Damascus and put

150
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:31,750
him on a one-way plane

151

154
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:44,340

160
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,320
an existential question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm 13 and he</font>

161

164
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:22,599
selfless humility of the engineers who

165
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:25,930
built this let's keep this spirit it's

magical<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meet governments I meet</font>

167
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:32,589
powerful people but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end we are</font>

168
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:34,360
all looking for purpose you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

169
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:37,000
Stanford neurosurgeon who just passed

away and wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> the book that you should</font>

let's keep striving let's keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">wonderful and I will take it everywhere</font>

179
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:12,040
I go it's enriched me in ways I will

180
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:14,620
never ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget ever recently which I</font>

181
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,860
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> do much i sat down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to write</font>

182
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,720
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was feeling so I wrote it</font>

183
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:23,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">down and you know I rarely read anything</font>

184
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,310
but I'll read it to you

185
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was in the middle of one of these</font>

186
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:33,520
difficult moments that I can wear

187
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:35,530
process was weighing on me and as you

188
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,500
know i'm impatient and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

189
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:41,620
things done but that I can I learned

190
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:46,330
that process is sacred is important so I

191
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:50,670
wrote this process is the guarantor of

192
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:54,960
our core values consensus first

193
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:59,530
bottom-up fact-based accountable and

194
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:04,660
impeccably<font color="#CCCCCC"> iguala Therrien but then i</font>

195
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:09,130
wrote spirit however is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bond of our</font>

196
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:15,060
community trust based transparent

197
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:19,600
inclusive free and deeply empathetic if

198
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:23,770
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not adhere to our processes we</font>

199
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:27,660
jeopardize our legitimacy however if we

200
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:31,689
lose our spirit we will fall apart and

201
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:35,650
join the long list of institutions that

202
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:40,870
prioritized procedural purity over our

203
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:46,240
character and principles so process is

204
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:49,150
precious but spirit is sacred balancing

205
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,050
them wisely is the only assurance of our

206
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:57,120
continued success and the soul of our

207
00:11:53,050 --> 00:12:03,520
impressive multi-stakeholder community

208
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:08,890
so with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I bid you farewell I will</font>

209
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:11,650
be the best cheerleader for you I will

210
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:14,620
still travel around the world and tell

211
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:16,689
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I touched this great</font>

212
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,480
community that I had the<font color="#CCCCCC"> privilege of</font>

213
