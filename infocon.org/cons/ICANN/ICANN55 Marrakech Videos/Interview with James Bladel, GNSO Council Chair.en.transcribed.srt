00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:18,790
the final report of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CC WG</font>

00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,940
accountability how do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it went</font>

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:24,160
I think it went<font color="#CCCCCC"> well it may have looked</font>

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,840
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> tedious from the floor but it</font>

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,370
was important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to conduct an</font>

recommendations the Gina so as you're

12
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,300
aware has a very large and diverse

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,399
organization with a wide spectrum of

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,230
stakeholders and so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was important for</font>

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,809
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to capture all of those views in our</font>

16
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,788
approval but ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> we agreed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

17
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:45,760
this report<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be accepted and</font>

18
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:48,249
submitted to the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some people</font>

22
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:56,829
developing from here on out well I think

00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's correct we have in front of us</font>

24
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:02,769
not only do we have the implementation

00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">of work stream</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 but now we're preparing</font>

26

as a community to address some of those

00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,800
issues that were not necessarily

28
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,690
associated with the transition but

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,060
deemed by the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be important</font>

30
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,649
accountability concerns the genus<font color="#E5E5E5"> L was</font>

very involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> work stream 1 and I</font>

32

suppose in addition to to the workstream

<font color="#E5E5E5">too that's a lot of other work coming up</font>

36
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,910
that Gina so has launched three big<font color="#CCCCCC"> GDPs</font>

37

what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the the key focus</font>

38
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:33,399

00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,900
hard to imagine life without see cwg

<font color="#E5E5E5">get a glimpse of what our tasks will</font>

42
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,590
look like our workload will look like in

43
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,270
the future first and foremost we've got

44
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,700
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of big pdps as you mentioned</font>

45
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,369
we're addressing subsequent rounds of

46
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,560
new gTLDs so we're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

47
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,630
what went right what went wrong and what

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes if any need to be looked at for</font>

49
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:58,860
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> round of new gtld applications</font>

50
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:01,210
we're also looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> RDS which is</font>

51
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,980
better known as who is or at least a

00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,679
replacement potential replacement for

53
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:08,460
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we're taking a top to bottom look</font>

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,380
at the registration data system

55
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,880
understanding the needs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use for</font>

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">that data and how they've changed over</font>

57
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,200
the years and whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that needs</font>

58
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,720
to

59
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,869
re-engineered and then finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just</font>

60
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,480
kicked off yesterday a PDP on rights

61
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,700
protection mechanisms in all gTLDs

62
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,109
including a udrp and my understanding is

63
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,230
this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time anyone's reviewed</font>

64
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:36,010
the udrp for its effectiveness policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

65
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:38,590
over 15 years old and I expect we'll see

66
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,060
a lot of engaging conversations on that

67
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:44,080
in the next few meetings to come as well

68
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,730
so lots on our docket as we as we head

69
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,980
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Marrakech yeah it sounds like</font>

70
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting and certainly busy times for</font>

72
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:54,220
can and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not interested in new</font>

73
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:56,170
gTLDs who is or intellectual property

74
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,819
rights I really have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder if you're</font>

75
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,230
if you're at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right beating because</font>

76
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,518
those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three big topics and those</font>

77
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,768
are all three that we're taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in</font>

78
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,540
the future are good and talking about

00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:06,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">meetings the next meeting is going to be</font>

80
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,220
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> so-called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be meeting a new format</font>

81
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:12,129
that i can is launching for the for the

82
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,349
annual meetings it's a shorter meeting

83
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:16,239
focused on policy how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

84
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:19,390
Gina so is going to push<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well we</font>

85
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,609
had substantive discussions with staff

86
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,170
and with the board and other SOS and ACS

87
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:24,489
over the weekend about meeting structure

88
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,798
be I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a challenge</font>

89
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:29,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get all of the work i just mentioned</font>

90
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,130
in to afford a schedule i think the gns

91
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:37,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">o is open to the idea of a smaller</font>

92
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:38,849
lighter leaner meaner I can meeting and

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,769
I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us would certainly</font>

94
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:43,720
welcome the idea to focus more on policy
