00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,900
good morning from<font color="#E5E5E5"> beautiful Marrakech</font>

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,790
we've had a historic meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> at icon 55</font>

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,039
and we're here sitting with dr. Steve

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,619
Crocker and dr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amato lot to talk about</font>

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,090
this let's start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you Steve last</font>

6
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:19,850
night the board delivered the IANA

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,800
stewardship proposal to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA after</font>

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,900
this to year-long effort how do you feel

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,750
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> morning well we feel absolutely</font>

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,490
ecstatic this was a great moment but let

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">me emphasize that although indeed we did</font>

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:34,190
deliver the proposals to proposals to

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:38,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US government this moment really</font>

14
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:41,510
marks a fantastic effort by the whole

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:45,739
community for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> period putting</font>

16
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:48,800
together its<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas and assembling a</font>

17
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:52,068
proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was really really hard</font>

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,718
work for a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people going into</font>

19
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:58,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">every detail and as I say although we</font>

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,239
did deliver the proposals and this is a

21
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:03,679
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going forward I think it's</font>

22
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,600
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to note how much work went</font>

23
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,670
into this and what that represents in

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,820
terms of a community really working

25
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:14,180
together and a lot of emphasis of course

26
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:17,449
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the multi-stakeholder model so the</font>

27
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,280
ensuing phase is quite critical so what

28
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,190
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next steps to ensuring the</font>

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,220
proposed transition goes through well

30
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:28,399
the immediate future is two parallel

31
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,550
tracks really the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> government will be</font>

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at these proposals and</font>

33
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:36,770
coordinating internally and that will

34
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:39,350
take we're told approximately 90 days in

35
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:42,110
parallel with that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font>

36
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:45,140
implementing much of the machinery<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

37
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,940
impose to make those changes go into

38
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:51,350
force there's a whole series of changes

39
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,970
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our bylaws we have the substance laid</font>

40
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:56,030
out in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposal but now we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

41
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,890
go through the drafting process and get

42
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> details right and everybody's going</font>

43
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,400
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be watching very closely to make sure</font>

44
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,930
that what was what they thought was

45
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,480
going to happen is actually embodied

46
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,340
correctly in the bylaws that'll be a

47
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,378
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> fast-paced</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> effort in order to</font>

48
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,410
operate in parallel with this government

49
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:13,390
process so what challenges do you see

50
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,740
lay ahead

51
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,569
well sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of high and low challenges if</font>

52
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,700
you will the high challenges are as I

53
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">said everybody is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be watching</font>

54
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make sure that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> details are right</font>

55
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,150
and that the agreements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we believe</font>

56
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,540
we've made don't come unraveled because

57
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:34,750
of something hidden below the surface

58
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,280
the low challenges are we're tired this

59
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,130
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to take a lot more work</font>

60
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,160
and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just got to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keep pressing and</font>

61
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,989
and and the serious part of that is in

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:49,120
addition to the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> being tired this</font>

63
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:51,160
displaces a lot of other work so the

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,860
agendas are building up of just ordinary

65
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,090
stuff that needs to be done and if

66
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,950
someday we'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to normal one day</font>

67
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">Akram you're serving as the interim CEO</font>

68
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,510
and president until you're in morbi

69
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,010
joins later this spring so what should

70
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:10,060
the community expect from you over the

71
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:14,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">next few months well more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the same so</font>

72
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:16,840
no surprises I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the community</font>

73
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:19,959
is familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I can't</font>

74
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,280
for over five years now we as Steve said

75
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,750
we have the transition to work on

76
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,840
preparing for the implementation and the

77
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:31,360
approval hopefully of the power<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

78
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,400
proposals and as we do these things we

79
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,760
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all the other activities of I</font>

80
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,459
can to to manage and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

81
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,298
deliver on them<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and can you provide</font>

82
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:45,640
a status update on the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD program</font>

83
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:48,820
so the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD programs in its final</font>

84
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,010
phases we've had the majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

85
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">process have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> implemented there is</font>

86
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:57,820
less than 40 applications that have not

87
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:59,769
been contracted and there are a few that

88
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,590
haven't been delegated a few more<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

89
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:06,840
hasn't been delegated and we continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

90
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:10,060
finish these processes applications and

91
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:15,700
contracts and hopefully we would be

92
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:18,728
finalizing them as as the urine comes in

93
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,500
and in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has the program been</font>

94
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:23,440
successful and how do you measure<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

95
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,430
success<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> community set</font>

96
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,570
out to do the program to deliver on

97
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:33,150
three main areas increasing competition

98
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:35,699
increasing choice and providing for more

99
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,310
innovation in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the domain name system and</font>

100
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,070
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that we've achieved all of them</font>

101
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,690
and there is more success to come and

102
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,300
can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the importance of</font>

103
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,699
the IDN program and any recent

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,100

of these learnings into the next round

so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we enhance the program as we go</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">55</font>

144
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,120
was obviously important on many levels

145
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:47,250
one of which was taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> place here in</font>

146
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,310
Africa<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a high attendance for the</font>

meeting well this was a success at every

single level this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a high</font>

152
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,840
point in multiple ways we had enormous

153
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:09,720
support from the local community all the

154
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,940
way up through the minister we had a

155
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-level meeting of ministers and</font>

156
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:17,640
other senior government officials which

157
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,830
we've only had twice before and this had

158
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,419
an extraordinary amount of participation

159
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:29,130
including of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this continent</font>

160
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:33,270
a key part of what I can is all about is

161
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:36,360
inclusiveness as participation and as is

162
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:39,150
to be expected and as normal the degree

163
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,130
of participation has varied quite a bit

164
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,739
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what region</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the developing</font>

165
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,900

advantageous position<font color="#E5E5E5"> respect so we</font>

167
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,130
worked very hard at trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

168
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:54,330
inclusive for the developing countries

169
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:57,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and since we're here in Africa this is a</font>

170
00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:01,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">particularly interesting and a focal</font>

171
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,750
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us and this is this is I think</font>

172

raise the consciousness<font color="#E5E5E5"> throughout the</font>

173
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:09,020
continent increased interest and

174
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:11,340
provides a basis going forward for a

175
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,789
sort of a new plateau if you will that

176
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:17,310
we can build on and returning<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">transition how what do we both what do</font>

178
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,080
you learn about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community through</font>

179
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,770
this process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a question for</font>

180
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">a crumb and then yourself Steve I think</font>

181
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:36,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if nothing else this transition got</font>

182
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:39,649
us closer as a community it brought some

183
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:43,068
parts of the communities that are not

184
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:45,379
always fully participating in I can and

185
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:47,360
brought us together<font color="#CCCCCC"> got us to work</font>

186
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:49,670
together there is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more familiarity</font>

187
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,379
and camaraderie going on and I think

188
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's important because the</font>

189
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:56,269
community now can realize that when they

190
00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:00,439
come together they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> deliver great</font>

191
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:03,139
things Steve well I certainly echo and

192
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:06,379
endorse everything that arkema said the

193
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:10,730
other teaching from this if you will is

194
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:16,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that things take time when this was all</font>

195
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:17,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">started March 14th 2014 the expectation</font>

196
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,199
was that the transition would be

197
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,060
complete in a year and a half now the

198
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:25,910
transition is not yet complete and were

199
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,489
two years in I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it will be running</font>

200
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:32,209
basically one year longer than we had

201
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:33,709
originally anticipated so and I don't

202
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:36,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's much that could have</font>

203
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:38,268
been done to change that and on

204
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,489
reflection I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

205
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:42,920
should have been done or<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a question</font>

206
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,920
of learning how big the community is how

207
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,660
diverse the views are and hence how long

208
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,240
it takes to knit everything together

209
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:53,240
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> serious big problem in</font>

210
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,939
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you um well this you know</font>

211
00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:00,769
brings us to the end of the interview

212
00:09:55,939 --> 00:10:04,370
but any final word Steve please ah we

213
