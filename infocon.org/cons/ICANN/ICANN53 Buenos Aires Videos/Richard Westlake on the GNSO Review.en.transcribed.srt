though is all 36 recommendations that

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,340
we've made and then at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of it</font>

17
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,500
we've grouped those 36 recommendations

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,460
into the four key themes that have

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,010
emerged the first of those key themes is

<font color="#E5E5E5">participation and representation the</font>

24
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,530
theme that emerged was around

which<font color="#E5E5E5"> the GMS oh now operates so we have</font>

have provided our assessment of how

effective they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> weather may still</font>

be room for improvement<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've</font>

69
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,129
provided our recommendations where that

seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be appropriate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:57,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">component of it was to adopt a working</font>

74
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:06,209
secondly we've looked at the

recommendations to revise the policy

76
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,440
development process the PDP and we've

77
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:12,569
provided some recommendations there as

78
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,450
to how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it could be made more</font>

79
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:17,970
effective again the third part was to

restructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh Council</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this has</font>

multiple constituency structure and

83
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,150
we've both assess the what we believe is

84
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,700
the effectiveness of that structure how

85
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,560
it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the council and some</font>

86
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,138
recommendations<font color="#E5E5E5"> there for improvements</font>

87
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,930
in how it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> work the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> component</font>

88
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,430
was to enhance the function the

89
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,160
effectiveness the operation of

90
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,739
constituencies themselves are to allow

91
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">it make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easier for constituencies to</font>

92
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,680
be created and potentially to disappear

93
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the fifth aspect of previous reviews</font>

94
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,590
was to look at how relationships

95
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:59,250
communications coordination between the

96
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,620
gns oh and other arms of ICANN could be

97
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:05,489
made more effective that's with the the

98
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,169
board<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself with other advisory</font>

99

organizations the final<font color="#E5E5E5"> chapter of our</font>

101
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:15,179
report addresses the changing

environment that the gns o operates in

103
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,519
and in particular it looks at the

104
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,380
changing nature of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet itself</font>

growth in participation and

108
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,008
how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gso is remaining current is</font>

109
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,650
remaining topical and can continue to do

110
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:36,900
so to remain topical and relevant to all

111
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,810
users of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet we've looked at</font>

issues around diversity of internet

new anymore of the new generic top-level

119
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,430
domain names and we've provided some

120
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,880
recommendations on how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that</font>

121
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:06,360
the gns<font color="#CCCCCC"> o needs to adapt over the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future</font>

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,699
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to remain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> relevant to that new</font>

123
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,710
environment finally the aspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

124
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:13,110
we've covered ears around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gns o</font>

125
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,570
structure it was this was not within our

126
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,280
original terms of reference but so many

127
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,810
people did raise it with us that we

128
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought it was necessary to provide some</font>

129
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:24,720
commentary we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

130
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,120
structure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gns o itself is the</font>

131
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,470
biggest issue that means to be faced at

132
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,270
the moment and we do know that

133
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:33,180
structural issues can become huge

134
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:35,250
distractions so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we try to provide our</font>

135
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,470
recommendations on things where we

136
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,360
believe the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gnss effectiveness can be</font>

137
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,940
improved but we have provided<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

138
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,520
commentary and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we haven't</font>

139
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,440
recommended changes of course that

140
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,090
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the gns i can't take</font>

141
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,520
responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that itself and if</font>

142
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:53,010
you decide either as a result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

143
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,139
report or as a result<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other</font>

144
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,180
discussions if you decide changes to the

145
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,780
structure are needed well that of course

146
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:04,020
is over to the gns oh gee MSO<font color="#E5E5E5"> council</font>

147
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,969
and its various community members so in

148
