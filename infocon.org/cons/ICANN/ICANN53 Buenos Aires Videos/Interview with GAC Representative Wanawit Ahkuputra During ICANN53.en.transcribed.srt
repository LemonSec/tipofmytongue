since the beginning of I can but like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

23
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,610
said the early times of the gap<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

24
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">mainly in the hand of academia and</font>

25
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,530
because we just start off with the

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,159
infrastructure but lately since the

27
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,799
internet become part of everything

28
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,040
business and almost like electricity i

29
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,140
should say but then on the other hand we

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,820
try to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how thailand has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,730
million people could use the English or

42
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,790
which you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> ascii types of the</font>

43
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,649
characters

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,798
some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even know how to spell</font>

45
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:23,769
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> name in asking but when you open up</font>

46
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:26,769
all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> international eyes I think</font>

47
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:29,739
that that the most important positions

48
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:33,700
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get into the gas we have to</font>

49
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:36,579
learn on how the other country develop

50
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,399
the public<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy end up to promote it</font>

51
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:42,670
and we like to learn from the other like

52
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,719
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arabic countries or the Chinese</font>

53
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:49,048
and Korea that verify hit in this

54
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:54,879
utilization of ID n so this is my eighth

55
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:57,879
again meeting I do see the big change in

56
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,970
the CAC how we work together one is the

57
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,739
cat try to be in the early engagement we

58
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:06,849
have several<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group working</font>

59
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:08,739
stream that we appoint the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gang who will</font>

60
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:10,659
take who will follow<font color="#CCCCCC"> up that and make a</font>

61
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,629
brief that one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that I do</font>

62
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:15,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">see that is changing quite a lot and I</font>

63
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:17,649
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second Lee is the</font>

64
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:20,888
participation as a shattering

65
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:23,560
organization in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cebu GCC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beauties and</font>

66
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:25,720
the participation from the CAC is

67
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,400
something that that I do see is knew

68
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:32,169
that the CAC try to to involve and

69
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,720
understand what is changing what is

70
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:37,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming internally there is a lot of</font>

71
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,060
change we we used to have like a monthly

72
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,760
meeting among the CAC or intersessional

73
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">e maybe only one or two time between the</font>

74
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,858
meeting now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every second week only</font>

75
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:50,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">only for the gap leadership teams and</font>

76
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:53,500
then every month or almost like two or

77
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:55,780
three times for the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> gap and we</font>

78
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,799
have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the briefing and to</font>

79
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,930
accommodate the time zones or some

80
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,780
meeting need to have to conduct at two

81
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,069
so it's become more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than a full-time job</font>

82
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,019
because you wake up at two o'clock in

83
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:11,108
<font color="#CCCCCC">the morning for a meeting and then next</font>

84
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:15,669
morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go to work one of the key</font>

85
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:18,220
important no matter is CW<font color="#E5E5E5"> G's or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD ID</font>

86
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:20,918
and the key point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people spend</font>

87
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,650
maybe a thousand of men are working

88
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,510
there I think that other things I always

89
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,409
respect the multi-stakeholder approach

90
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,219
like

91
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:33,010
and we also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a local</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Thai community</font>

92
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,050
almost like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-stakeholder in the</font>

93
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:37,990
beginning we call Thailand internet

94
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,970
multi-stakeholder it's comprised mainly

95
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:43,090
on the technical because in the early

96
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,430
stage when when I step in since Beijing

97
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:49,659
most of the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very complex the</font>

98
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:51,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">NSX ipv6 and all this you cannot talk to</font>

99
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,280
the public general so in the first two

100
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,850
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I establish a strong foundation</font>

101
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:01,179
for multi stakeholder in technology

102
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:04,390
aspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> Academy ccTLDs or these people</font>

103
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">now we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> evolved with just setting up and</font>

104
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:11,110
we agree on the Charter we change to be

105
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:13,210
a tie I GF so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring in the Civil we</font>

106
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,580
bring in other government will being in

107
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,370
the student we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very proactive</font>

108
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,640
on on how we laid an infrastructure and

109
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,500
we communicate to the people i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

110
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,320
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all when i discuss with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a new</font>

111
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:30,570
country then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i try to approach to bring</font>

112
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,490
them as a gang the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

113
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:37,860
the difference from my hand to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

114
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:42,850
fora we also participate like I tu apex

115
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:45,490
essence and this is a working floor

116
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:48,580
people are come here to work we not the

117
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,680
dialogue floor so I just tell them<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

118
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you have to understand the fact</font>

119
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:57,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's difficult in that sense to get</font>

120
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,200
in the problem is it's become I always

121
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">call people is become like Hotel</font>

122
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,890
California you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> check out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime you</font>

123
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,620
like but you never leave because they

124
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:08,830
become a communities we work together

125
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:12,640
the first group I met is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lag GNA saws</font>

126
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:15,190
and we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk among each other's I</font>

127
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,020
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> community is not the</font>

128
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,469
community that work and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

129
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,320
telling them it difficult to get in and

130
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:25,900
difficult to get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

131
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,280
attached to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the communities and I've</font>

132
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,380
said even if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a government</font>

133
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,950
that still are other charter

134
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:36,390
organization that you can still working

135
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,390
that what I tell them
