not guaranteed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> those organizations</font>

16
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,180
would support the work much as I can

17
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,949
testify that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have done a very</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">comprehensive amount of work and made a</font>

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,870
substantial and wide-ranging report we

20
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,399
were not guaranteed but I'm very pleased

21
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,099
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to tell you that all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

coordinating group as a response to

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,850
their request for proposals so the great

26
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,590
news is that that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

27
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:09,539
coordinating group has a proposal from

28
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,729
the names community the numbering

29
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,729
community and the protocol community and

30
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,950
in so doing they have three responses to

31
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,380
their initial request for proposal which

32
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,890
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now continue</font>

33
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:28,169
their work to prepare and synthesize

34
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:32,850
those into a single response<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA</font>

35
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:35,100
who issued the the initial request or

36
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,789
over a year ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> now this is a big moment</font>

37
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,770
for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we we have all three</font>

38
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:43,740
responses to to that request for

39
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,798
proposals the coordinating group can get

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,570
on with its work but the job isn't done

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,700
yet and there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> another there's another</font>

42
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,490
parallel piece of work that's going on

43
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:59,040
in the names community and that is to

44
00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:01,949
look at a review and revision of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key</font>

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,899
accountability mechanisms<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I can so</font>

46
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,759
what happens now is the overall work

47
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,160
essentially goes off on two separate

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,288
tracks we've got the three proposals in

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,440
with the coordinating group they'll do

50
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:16,040
their work to synthesize those and

51
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:18,590
prepare that response in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition we've</font>

52
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,750
got a separate group that is looking at

53
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,300
the accountability measures and they

54
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,790
will they will prepare a further draft

55
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,550
report and ideally<font color="#CCCCCC"> a final report ahead</font>

56
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,709
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our I can meeting in Dublin at which</font>

57
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:33,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">point these two parts come back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together</font>

58
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:37,390
again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideally we'll be presenting at</font>

59
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:40,280
that point a double package of the

60
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">combined requests for proposals that</font>

61
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,720
came from the coordination group plus

62
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,660
the enhanced accountability mechanisms

63
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,870
and we can hand that over to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA</font>

64
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:54,890
via the ICANN board to produce this

65
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:57,320
combined package of measures so a major

66
00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:00,529
milestone here in Buenos Aires but it's

67
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">not quite the end of the road yet but we</font>

68
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,270
really have made<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good progress so I</font>

69
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,820
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me personally as one of the</font>

70
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:10,280
co-chairs of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cwg it's very</font>

71
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,540
satisfying but it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> satisfying more</font>

72
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,300
broadly it's satisfying for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

73
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,880
community that we can come<font color="#E5E5E5"> together with</font>

74
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">a cross-community working group dealing</font>

75
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a very thorny issue with a lot of</font>

76
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:25,670
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> views and make the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> necessary</font>

77
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,980
compromises and adjustments and efforts

78
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:33,530
and all of that takes to produce a

79
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:35,450
coherent<font color="#E5E5E5"> freestanding proposal that</font>

80
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,150
makes sense and so I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a proud</font>

81
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,600
moment for all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us that we can have</font>

82
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,600
reached this milestone
