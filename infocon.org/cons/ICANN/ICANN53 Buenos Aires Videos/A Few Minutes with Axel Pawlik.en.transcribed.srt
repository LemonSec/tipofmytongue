00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,240
the involvement with icon is that the

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,760
and we thought in the case that that

should not end in a stable configuration

with them be early two<font color="#CCCCCC"> values when they</font>

were little bit slow but they did what

process it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> very well the only</font>

66
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:06,700
issue that the numbering people have is

67
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:10,810
when we go out throughout our community

68
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:12,638
we here quite frequently that oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">standby ike i can is an American</font>

corporation they are in the bags of the

71
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:19,720
American government and then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

72
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:22,359
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most comfortable position to</font>

73
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,750
be defending and I mean we have heard

74
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:28,569
about Snowden those issues that didn't

75
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:31,689
really help defending the US government

76
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:36,310
I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was helping getting this</font>

77
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:38,439
process rolling of letting go<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

78
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,239
control now but enough for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the numbers</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">past for us it really is about public</font>

83

ntia would be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> now seeing our</font>

little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier in relations with our</font>
