community and make sure everything we do

29
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,939

I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> share this important</font>

in that important<font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding now</font>

236
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:40,800
globalization as the last area i want to

237
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:44,550
touch on is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> project that was very</font>

238
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:48,449
central to my agenda since<font color="#E5E5E5"> i began at</font>

239
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:52,349
ICANN globalization is a journey it is

240
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:54,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a one-time event</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm not naive</font>

241
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,000
to believe that simply putting people

242
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:59,459
around the world means we are global

243
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,759
when I was at IBM we spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

244
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:05,430
globalization in three layers almost

245
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,889
three stages the first stage is the

246
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,109
geographic stage which means you can't

247
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:12,149
say your global running IBM from<font color="#CCCCCC"> armonk</font>

248
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,949
you need to be all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

249
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:16,980
need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> present but that's not</font>

250
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:19,319
sufficient the next thing you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

251
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:23,810
and today we have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 30 countries</font>

252
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:26,160
i can has people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 countries today</font>

253
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:29,189
the next thing you have to do is to

254
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,370
globalize the way you work your process

255
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:34,529
is your<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems your approaches so today</font>

256
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:38,250
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to inform you that after a</font>

257
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:41,819
very long year we have now delivered on

258
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:44,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability of any stakeholder to call a</font>

259
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:47,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">local number in their country and reach</font>

260
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:51,839
I can 24 hours a day five days a week

261
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:55,529
and not just in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> UN languages in all</font>

262
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,389
your languages + german we add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> german</font>

263
00:12:55,529 --> 00:13:01,019
and we'll be adding other languages and

264
00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:03,809
the access locally is with local numbers

265
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:06,689
and that's now all running from our

266
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:10,170
three hubs remember we built<font color="#CCCCCC"> Los Angeles</font>

267
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:12,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">Singapore and Istanbul these hubs are</font>

268
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,790
operating these service centers for us

269
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:20,819
around the world so when a user calls

270
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:24,000
and issues a request in Singapore if

271
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:25,439
they call again at any time if the

272
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,589
Singapore team is at home with<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

273
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:30,689
family this double team can answer 24

274
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:33,420
hours a day we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> people with the same</font>

275
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:34,889
issues on a common system so that's

276
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,410
already in place

277
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:40,709
the next thing we did was local

278
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:42,420
localizing what we do because a lot of

279
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:43,949
our system<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> based on the UN</font>

280
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,649
languages but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reality is there are</font>

281
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:49,469
many people who are internet users who

282
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:52,529
don't use the UN languages so we started

283
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:55,049
the project<font color="#E5E5E5"> with our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> community to take</font>

284
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:58,049
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> materials and make them work</font>

285
00:13:55,049 --> 00:14:00,629
in local languages and that project in

286
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:02,790
the asia-pacific region<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the great</font>

287
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:05,129
support of our friends in Korea

288
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:07,290
initially and<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you South Korea for</font>

327
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:06,459
operating room I've heard stories about

328
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,130
the work that has gone on this I've

329
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:12,250
heard of someone involved in this work

who<font color="#E5E5E5"> slept on her keyboard and her head</font>

to you will have three phases the first

340
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,860
phase that we're living right now will

341
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:54,370
lead us to the multi-stakeholder

342
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:59,400
community delivering a proposal to the

343

completion of your work of our work once

345
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:11,708
that proposal is delivered we go into

346
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:17,320
phase 2 phase 2 as mr. Strickland said

347
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:19,510
yesterday will last for 25 months larry

348
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:21,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">was explaining that during these four to</font>

349
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:24,550
five months there<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be a period of</font>

350
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:27,490
review which will involve the community

351
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:33,129
and many members<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the US government at</font>

352
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:35,500

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:39,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">Strickland and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia will need to deliver</font>

354
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:43,090
a certification now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

355
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:45,969
become<font color="#E5E5E5"> law soon that is almost law that</font>

356
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,560
the US Congress will pass a law that mr.

357
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:52,230
Strickland will need to deliver a

358
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:56,050
certification confirming two things one

359
00:17:52,230 --> 00:18:00,050
that the proposal has met<font color="#E5E5E5"> the criteria</font>

360
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:02,960
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia has set out to all of us</font>

361
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:05,960
I think we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we will meet this</font>

362
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,660
criteria and we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure when we</font>

363
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,540
deliver the end of phase one that we

364
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,370
clarify that we have met these criteria

365
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:15,740
we hope he will agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with us but we'll</font>

366
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:18,500
do our part and I'm sure he will respond

367
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,380
accordingly the second thing mr.

368
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:25,070
Strickland will do is to confirm that

369
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:29,870
the bylaw changes required from this

370
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:32,300
proposal have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted and therefore</font>

371
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:35,870
you see that red line at the bottom

372
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:39,110
where the i kin community and board will

373
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:42,219
work towards implementing the bylaws but

374
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:46,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">me towards adopting the bylaws in time</font>

375
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:50,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">before the white line which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the point</font>

376
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:56,780
ntia gives Congress a certification

377
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:59,540
letter now after<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia delivers the</font>

378
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:02,810
certification letter the law that

381
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:14,300
which Congress can also review the

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,860
certification 30 legislative days for

383
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,379
those of us who are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> close to</font>

384
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:21,919
Washington these are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 weekdays</font>

385
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:29,000
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not 30 calendar days these are</font>

386
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:32,210
30 days Congress is in session typically

387
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's 45 to 60 days that's what it is but</font>

388
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,840
again we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know because the</font>

389
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:41,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">Congressional calendar is not out for</font>

390
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:45,199
2016 so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> phase two at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end of</font>

391
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:50,420
Phase two the review of our proposal is

392
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:52,940
finished we're done what's left then

393
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,010
would be whatever is left of

394
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:59,570
implementation which brings me to phase

395
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:02,090
3 phase<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 is the phase that will end</font>

396
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:06,530
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transfer of stewardship from</font>

397
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:08,678
the US government to us that's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

398
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:12,820
contract will lapse

399
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:15,179
now leading up to phase three we're

400
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:17,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to start activities of</font>

401
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:20,619
operationalizing and implementing the

402
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:24,639
proposal notice that line the red line

403
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:26,408
starts kind of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of now we're not</font>

404
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:29,860
going to wait till then and you heard

405
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:31,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">ntia as they clearly say there are three</font>

406
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:35,408
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could be</font>

407
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:37,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">implemented and two of these and you can</font>

408
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:39,700
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the record to read mr.</font>

409
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:43,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">stripling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> notes two of these could start</font>

410
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:46,360
now and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will work together community</font>

411
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:50,320
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA to figure out what could start</font>

412
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:53,439
now so we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait till phase three to</font>

413
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,830
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> implementation and that is a</font>

414
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,470
commitment<font color="#E5E5E5"> from us now that</font>

415
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:03,100
implementation when it ends will get us

416
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:05,559
to this point now all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you I hope</font>

417
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:09,730
appreciate these three important phases

418
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:12,100
the question is when now it's not for me

419
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:15,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">to decide when or for the board it's for</font>

420
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,869
you so I have gone and asked our

421
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,899
community leaders are working group

422
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:22,119
leaders what are your timelines what are

423
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:24,668
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at right now when will these</font>

424
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:27,639
things be ready so I'm today going to

425
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:32,940
report to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the messages I got back</font>

426
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:40,149
from them the first is that phase one

427
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:43,179
could end in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dublin around I can 54 this</font>

428
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:47,549
is important phase one could end in

429
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:50,619
double now we may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a week too late a</font>

430
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:52,179
month late I think we could we could

431
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:55,749
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that but in general the</font>
