what goes on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the booth is very intense</font>

it's exhausting<font color="#CCCCCC"> catheters do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">first understand what is being said and</font>

13
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:45,570
that requires a great deal of

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:49,589
preparation and really focusing on the

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,800
task at hand it is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most</font>

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:56,010
amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that the brain can do and</font>

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,828
you have to practice to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow it</font>

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:02,579
becomes very natural after<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

19
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:06,090
because you automatically don't think

stop and think all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technical terms</font>

alphabet soup all that makes our job

27
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,600
significantly and more difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,740
we need to prepare so much for every

event

30
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,439
yes it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> take some studying some</font>

31

rehearsal some sitting at home and<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:46,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">in most of the language is however</font>

37
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,580
there's certain languages they require

38
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:50,200
three persons in the booth what we do

39
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,200
requires a great deal of focus and

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">concentration like I said earlier and so</font>

41

44
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,330
complexity of the assignment and so we

45
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,330
switch every half hour

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,000
