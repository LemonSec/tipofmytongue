the head of communication for Latin

5
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,529
America and the Caribbean I had the

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,390
opportunity this morning to talk with

with us this morning thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font>

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:30,839
Steve let's start with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> 17 years ago</font>

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,519
1998 right here in Buenos Aires the

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,670
white paper discussions took place that

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,800
led to<font color="#E5E5E5"> affirmation of icon do you see</font>

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,480
any parallels between that event and

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,890
restoring time we're now in with the

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,398
IANA stewardship transition well

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately I was not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually here I</font>

19
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:50,879
joined I can a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years later but</font>

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,010
I know something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that process this</font>

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,269
is I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a very good question</font>

22
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I think this is indeed related</font>

23
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,300
in two ways the process is similar

24
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:04,289
enormous involvement from the community

25
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,720
massive involvement from the committee

26
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,380
and the second relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the matching</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process that was the</font>

28
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,509
opening that led to the creation of I

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,630
can and as part of that whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

30
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:21,840
was an anticipation that this day would

31
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:25,399
come when we are looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at having I can</font>

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:29,310
be independent of any<font color="#E5E5E5"> government and be</font>

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:32,790
serving the entire globe<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it's a</font>

34
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,920
sort of the expected<font color="#CCCCCC"> int is time it's</font>

35
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,829
taken longer than<font color="#E5E5E5"> anticipated but it is</font>

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,210
exactly what even though the timing is

37
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,250
different it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what was</font>

38
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">expected how do you feel about the</font>

39
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,330
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that took place in Buenos</font>

41
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:50,289
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I believe the community</font>

42
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:53,470
once again showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> its incredible focus</font>

43
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:57,190
but also its ability to<font color="#CCCCCC"> move all the</font>

44
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:59,410
stakeholders forward with success the we

45
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:02,230
will remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Buenos Aires all</font>

46
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:05,289
the chartering organizations for the

50
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,590
a huge milestone accomplished right here

51
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,380
through the work of many many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

52
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,230
holed up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> different rooms including</font>

53
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:26,170
the tens of governments that were here

54
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:29,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">to support this process so that's a</font>

55
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:32,440
milestone that frankly moves the needle

56
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,530
forward very well towards finishing our

57
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,370
work in Dublin<font color="#E5E5E5"> and secondly the cross</font>

62
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,870
very substantive discussions here in

63
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:54,489
Buenos Aires discussions that brought

64
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:56,200
light to the various issues as well as

65
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:58,360
the various opportunities we have to

board's role evolving the board the

of the board and to be responsive to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

the community wants but mainly to

oversee that the processes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:31,820
I can is to a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> extent more</font>

100
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,950
independent than it was which reminds me

101
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:39,440
that fadi emphasized the acceptance<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

102
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,360
the proposal by the US government which

103
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,730
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important and because that will</font>

104
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,060
permit the US government<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make the</font>

105
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:49,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">decision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to release its relationship</font>

106
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,680
with us but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> equally important and I</font>

107
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may be absolutely vital</font>

108
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,890
and emphasizing the point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the body</font>

109
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:00,620
made subsequently that we serve the

00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">community and that it's the community</font>

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,940
that has to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> satisfied with the</font>

performance of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can and it has to be of</font>

course satisfied with the proposals and

114
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:12,620
the adoption of the bylaws and the

115
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,200
implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the bylaws that are</font>

116
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:18,890
there so the board's role is to keep in

117
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:22,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">mind the community's desires and</font>

transparency and with complete

accountability and Alex if I could add

125
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:42,950
to what Steve said when he used the term

126
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:46,510
community now in the context of this

the community to include also our sister

131
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,950
organizations which are the IETF which

the road to a thoughtful whistles review

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> India has now taken its global role</font>

257
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:11,080
remember that the Latin American region

258
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:14,140
has served in many ways as a beacon as

259
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:18,400
an example of collaborative work whether

260
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:20,740
it's the CGI in Brazil which shows how<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>
