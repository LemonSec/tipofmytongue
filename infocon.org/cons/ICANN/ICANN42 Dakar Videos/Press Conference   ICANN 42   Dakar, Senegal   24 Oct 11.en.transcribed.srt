those amounts cover the costs on a

the board of directors<font color="#CCCCCC"> of i can has made</font>

proposals for the board to consider we

70
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:57,060
hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there will be applicants for</font>

other geographies for those who decide

73
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:05,720
they have an interest and we at ICANN

74
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,608
are not here to advocate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program</font>

75
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,859
we're here to educate so that

76
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:14,060
organizations can make a decision about

77
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:16,889
whether they wish to participate or not

78
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:20,310
that's all I have to say in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> opening</font>

79
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:26,199
remarks and I'll now hand it over to our

<font color="#CCCCCC">Chairman dr. Steve Crocker thank you rod</font>

81
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:36,560

<font color="#E5E5E5">to be here in Africa again one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:04:52,190 --> 00:05:01,460
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Africa that's actually a quite</font>

88
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:04,910
exciting prospect because it means the

89
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:07,070
next time that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we come back we expect we</font>

90
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,080
will see the benefit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the enormous</font>

91
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:13,070
growth rates that we have seen in other

92
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:16,330
parts of the world so there's not a

93
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:20,180
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of detail</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I want to add</font>

97
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,900
encourage and we welcome participation

00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:37,000
by everybody from all segments of

99
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:40,820
society and the results are usually

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,430
amazing and so with that let me invite

101
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:47,120
questions to either mr. bextrum or

102
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:49,940
myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> on any topic that you like this</font>

107
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:06,830
I'm across with DC so no a placebo

108
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:09,889
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> question that $25,000 for the</font>

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:15,530
registration k<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't you think that this</font>

110
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:18,620
amount is just excessive thank you for

111
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:23,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the first question</font>

112
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:27,190
relates to how can anyone get involved

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:33,020
and I can in Africa is is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct</font>

114
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:36,650
and the answer is i can has an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-door</font>

115
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:39,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">policy anyone in the world can register</font>

00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:45,709
public meetings including this one and

118
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:47,689
there are many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different stakeholder</font>

119
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:50,419
groups that one can choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to become</font>

120
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:53,179
involved in but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have to join a</font>

00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:58,399
attend that I can meeting you can simply

123
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:00,619
attend as an individual and<font color="#E5E5E5"> add and I</font>

124
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,330
can meeting there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> different public</font>

125
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:06,349
sessions where there's an open

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:09,979
microphone and anyone can speak the

127
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:13,669
second question was about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fees and</font>

128
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:17,019
the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD program and what I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

129
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:20,448
<font color="#CCCCCC">share is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can is a nonprofit</font>

130
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:24,439
organization we serve the global public

131
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:28,689
interest and all of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> efforts are done</font>

132
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:32,169
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a non-profit basis so the new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD</font>

133
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:37,459
program is priced out at a break-even

134
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:40,729
basis and the 185 thousand dollar charge

135
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:43,399
for application processing relates to

136
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:47,079
what we have to pay to<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party</font>

137
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:49,729
experts to process those applications

138
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:53,360
operating a<font color="#CCCCCC"> top-level domain is a</font>

139
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:55,998
completely different level of<font color="#E5E5E5"> investment</font>

140
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,789
than having a second-level domain and

141
00:07:55,999 --> 00:08:01,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">the difference is that top-level domains</font>

142
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:03,649
could have many thousands or even

143
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:06,169
millions of domain names registered

144
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:08,629
under them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the technical</font>

145
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:11,649
operations have to be extremely secure

146
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:14,269
and extremely reliable so the overall

147
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:18,259
investment for operating a top-level

148
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:21,489
domain is much higher than than just the

149
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:25,219
ICANN fees but those fees are done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

for this fund and you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:52,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">selection because that will put you in a</font>

that thank you mystic Monica nice to

176
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,839

about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jazz working group proposal</font>

of reduction in the application fees and

180
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,839
I simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at this</font>

181
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:08,070
point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jazz working group has</font>

182
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,680
issued a report with its recommendations

but none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those recommendations has</font>

187
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:27,990
with a solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if progress can be</font>

188
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:31,620
made this week could potentially be

189
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:34,709
approved as early as Friday at the board

190
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,959
meeting at the close of this meeting but

191
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:39,650
there's been no decisions made to reduce

192
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,270
application fees at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in time</font>

193
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:45,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was an open session this morning</font>

194
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:47,819
where the Jazz working group presented

195
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:51,089
their recommendations publicly and

196
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:54,260
answered took questions and answers so

197
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:56,670
you might wish to look at that

198
00:10:54,260 --> 00:11:00,900
transcription for more<font color="#E5E5E5"> information on</font>

199
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:03,930
that secondly Monica you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

200
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:06,720
about the applicant guidebook for new

201
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:09,149
gTLDs and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

202
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,079
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what might change in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

203
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:15,180
applicant<font color="#E5E5E5"> guidebook and there's it's</font>

204
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:18,599
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> note that the applicant</font>

205
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:21,329
guide book itself states that the board

206
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,639
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICANN reserves the right to make</font>

207
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:26,459
changes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the applicant guidebook at</font>

208
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:29,699
any time in the future that it deems

209
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:32,819
appropriate so when we recently

210
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:34,889
published the guidebook we referred to

211
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:37,649
it as a complete version of the guide

212
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:40,529
book because it included complete

213
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:44,399
information on the program there is

214
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:47,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">however as discussed discussions</font>

215
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:51,870
underway with respect to possible needy

216
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:54,719
applicant support and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> language and</font>

217
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:57,209
any such program might be included in

218
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,079
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guidebook or referred to by the</font>

219
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:04,469
guidebook so that's one possible

220
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,779
anticipated change at the present and I

221
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,839
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your third question was about</font>

222
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:11,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">the automation of root zone changes and</font>

223
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:18,899
could I ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to please repeat the</font>

224
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:21,629
specific question on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one Monica the</font>

225
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:23,730
question is just how will that work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

226
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:25,860
how will the automation work and I also

227
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,779
included a question on will there be

228
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,269
competition for for that did because it

229
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:32,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be an open bid so you are working</font>

230
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:34,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the automation but on the on the same</font>

231
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:36,388
time you don't know if you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

232
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:40,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">only competitor for that for the</font>

233
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:42,540
contract for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the iono contract okay so I</font>

234
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,729
think there's two questions once about

235
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,969
the root zone automation and that that

236
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:50,790
is technology that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was developed by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

237
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,860
by I can in support of the IANA

238
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,290

239
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,709
functions under the existing contracts

240
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:03,059
and consistent<font color="#E5E5E5"> with IETF RFC s and</font>

241
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:05,939
guidance the root zone automation system

242
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:08,519
has been deployed and it is used by I

243
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:12,589
can it's used by the Department of

244
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:18,259
Commerce it's also used by verisign and

245
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:20,529
that has occurred with respect to the

246
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:22,949
iono contract renew

247
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:26,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll until the Department of Commerce</font>

from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy or an operational</font>

292
00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:35,819
standpoint in terms of

293
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,800
being more sensitive to the issues or

294
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,860
needs of the specific industry as

295
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:44,640
opposed to the global<font color="#E5E5E5"> public interest so</font>

296
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:47,910
my comments were to say that I think

297
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:51,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important that I can remain</font>

who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a potential candidate is of</font>

310
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:34,829

<font color="#E5E5E5">balance two factors we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very concerned</font>

board has gone a part wade through the

316
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:56,819
process of working out those rules and

317
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:59,430
its first and key step was to make sure

318
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,529
that everybody inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board who's</font>

it's worked out everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the board</font>

321
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:10,020
is absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a candidate we have</font>

not expressed we have not taken a

decision about any further set of rules

324
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:19,589
we will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the position of hiring</font>

326
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:26,990
in a conflicted position after they take

327
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:30,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the job which is a pretty</font>

328
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">straightforward and fully expected point</font>

329
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,720
of view that is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would not be hiring</font>

330
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:36,330
somebody who would concurrently have

331
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,690
business interests outside rods

332
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:43,020
expressed a much tougher standard that

333
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:45,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">is his opinion as he made clear it's a</font>

334
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,330
very reasonable<font color="#CCCCCC"> and respectable opinion</font>

335
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,540
but it is his personal opinion

336
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:56,980
it will be an input to the process we

337
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:59,110
have formed a team of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> within the</font>

00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,480

entire selection process in search

340
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,760
process and it has a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

341
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">components to it and one of the</font>

342
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,780
components will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work out these</font>

343
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,000
rules and I think we have a question in

344
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,309
the room here that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have just three</font>

345
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,100
questions first of all I would like to

346
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:20,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the very meaning of icon what</font>

347
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:23,830
doesn't mean exactly in English the very

348
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:26,890
meaning and second I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

349
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:30,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next icon where will it be held</font>

350
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,780
exactly I'm in the place and I would

351
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:34,300
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know also the benefits that</font>

352
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:37,270
Africa may gain in these very

353
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:39,790
organizations that's what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like</font>

354
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know please and if he can have some</font>

355
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,500
documents because we don't have any

356
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:48,070
document about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> very organization</font>

357
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:50,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">thanks sure thank you I think that your</font>

358
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,389
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> question sir is about the meaning</font>

359
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:55,899
of the name and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the name is the internet</font>

360
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:59,050
is I can is an acronym for Internet

361
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:02,260
Corporation for Assigned Names and

362
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:05,440
numbers the names of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet refer</font>

363
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:08,530
to domain names and the numbers refer to

364
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet addresses such as ipv4 and ipv6</font>

365
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:14,860
addresses that machines on the internet

366
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:17,440
use and devices use to communicate and

367
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:20,020
that in general describes their primary

368
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,690
scope of activity of I can we're also

369
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:26,170
involved with other what are called

370
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:27,910
unique identifiers or which are

371
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,250
technically referred to as the protocol

372
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:33,309
and parameter registries of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

373
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:35,920
here's a way to think about I can the

374
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:38,740
internet is comprised of<font color="#E5E5E5"> many millions</font>

375
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,690
of private networks but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go on</font>

376
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:44,200
to that thing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that place called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

377
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:47,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet it looks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one place what</font>

378
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,540
makes it look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like one place what makes</font>

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,309
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like one place is cohesion of</font>

380
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,090
the domain name system the fact that

381
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:56,470
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal email system is unique</font>

382
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:59,649
there's no one else that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has the same</font>

383
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:01,420
email address because if ten people have

384
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,070
the same email address the

385
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,410
system would become schizophrenic and

386
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,750
wouldn't know how to get the message

387
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:10,630
directly<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you the same is true of</font>

388
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,610
Internet addresses each address needs to

389
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:15,640
be unique and then there's a set of

390
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:17,320
technical settings better determine by

391
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,060
the technical experts of the internet

392
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet engineering task force that</font>

those and the i kin community

coordinates these through our policies

399
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,330
and through the independent actions that

come together so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> help the internet</font>

look like one place which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why our</font>

402
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:48,640
slogan is one world one internet that's

<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can does there are many documents</font>

on I can and<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe someone can get the</font>

405
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,419
gentleman a one-page strategic plan

406
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:59,440
which I would recommend if you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

407
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:01,930
website i can org you'll find<font color="#CCCCCC"> a one-page</font>

408
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,820
strategic plan that<font color="#CCCCCC"> provides somewhat of</font>

409
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:06,220
a summary and then you'll find more

410
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,500
thousands of pages of documents than you

411
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:12,340
might ever want to read on specific

412
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:15,160
policies and specific programs and I

413
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:17,439
think hopefully that also offer helps to

414
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,330
answer your what the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

415
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,260
had is where is the next meaning our

416
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:25,570

424
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:55,300
that correct some time in 2013 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

425
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:57,820
there's sometimes regional meetings and

426
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:00,580
if you have an interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example in</font>

the at large structures which often

00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:07,110
include civil society then those

435
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:29,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">have another question in the room here I</font>

436
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:32,710
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know they said for new</font>

00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:38,920
them how we know that less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than five</font>

percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Africa of users are here in</font>

440
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,760
Africa and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> majority of them in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

443
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:54,760
people to have new gTLDs in their

444
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:58,540
country sure well new gTLDs can be

445
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:00,490
applied for<font color="#E5E5E5"> by any organization but most</font>

446
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,980
of those organizations will want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

447
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:04,870
of some size because of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical</font>

448
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:08,200
requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> management requirements</font>

449
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:10,810
legal requirements etc and we're not

450
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that any specific users need them</font>

451
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:15,760
but the global Internet community has

452
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:19,180
stated<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they wish to have more</font>

453
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:21,520
choice in domain names<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one way to</font>

454
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:25,000
have more choice is to create new

455
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,980
top-level domains and so even if this

456
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,650
event you'll hear some proposals from

457
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:33,760
different parties for new generic

458
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:35,830
top-level domains here in Africa<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it</font>

459
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,560
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply provide more choice for</font>

460
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:40,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone who for example is not able to</font>

461
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:45,159
get the domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> name that they want today</font>

462
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:47,650
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example.com or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a.org top-level</font>

463
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:51,310
domain because perhaps that name is

464
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:53,890
already taken so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see i would</font>

465
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:55,659
think that for many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> their first</font>

466
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,820
priority is to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the</font>

467
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:01,030
internet through a smart phone or

00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:05,590
through a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pc or a tablet computer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

469
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:07,870
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them to decide Steve</font>

470
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:10,449
we've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question for you from Doogie</font>

confirm<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is if Senegal doesn't have</font>

488
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:13,090
the root server does can't really be

489
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:16,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to have other this kind of</font>

question<font color="#E5E5E5"> the applicant guidebook which</font>

492
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:28,150
is effectively the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rulebook for the new</font>

493
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:31,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">gTLD program has more than 300 pages of</font>

494
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:34,720
information one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> sections is</font>

495
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:37,210
about Geographic Names and there's

496
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:41,290
different protections for continent

497
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:46,380
names for city names for capital names

498
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:51,480
and for subdivisions of nations such as

499
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:55,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">states so in the case of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a name such as</font>

500
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:58,180
the continent Africa there's a section

00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:03,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the applicant guide book that talks</font>

502
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:03,210
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rules for such an application</font>

503
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:11,670
we add<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this in the form of the</font>

504
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:17,530
question was the possible

505
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:20,080
misunderstanding of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the relationship</font>

506
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:23,230
between a root server and protection of

507
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,060
a name like Africa all of the root

508
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:28,780
servers serve exactly the same

509
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:31,060
information no additions no subtractions

510
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,100
exactly the same information so it does

511
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:35,860
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter whether you have a root</font>

512
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:39,159
server you don't have a root server the

513
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:42,000
same information is served the way to

514
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,490
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> a name is as rod</font>

described through the processes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

516
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:51,060
laid out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> detail through the applicant</font>

00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:54,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">guidebook the location of root servers</font>

518
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:56,970
is to serve<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community of people</font>

522
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:08,250
independent topics and it's helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

523
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,430
think to understand that they are they

524
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:15,090
are decoupled and have no relationship

525
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:18,330

impact on the first expansion sir such

00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:08,940
as calm because if I'm reselling a car

777

i would like to have dot auto so will

the the first extensions thank you well

781
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,660
we certainly hope that it does have an

782
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:27,390
impact since one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the goals of the</font>

783
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:30,060
program is to introduce more consumer

784
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:32,490
choice and competition into the domain

785
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:35,310
name marketplace so we would certainly

786
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:40,080
hope that consumers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

787
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:42,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">end-users see more choices and and</font>

788
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,819
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> very competitive offerings and</font>

789
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:47,310
very competitive prices in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future</font>

790
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:51,360
but ultimately that will depend on who

791
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:54,570
applies for new gTLDs and what choices

792
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:58,530
they offer but certainly that's one of

793
00:41:54,570 --> 00:42:01,970
the reasons for introducing the program

794
