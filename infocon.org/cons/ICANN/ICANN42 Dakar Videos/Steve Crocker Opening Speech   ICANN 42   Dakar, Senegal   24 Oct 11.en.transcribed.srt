that resulted<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a very substantial</font>

work to define the protocols for the new

was to visit<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other's laboratories</font>

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,790
we understood the irony in that decision

in principle<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network was supposed to</font>

decrease<font color="#CCCCCC"> the need for travel yet we</font>

50
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,430
intuitively understood that face-to-face

54
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,470

tradition that continues unbroken all

56
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,660
these years and brings us here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dakar</font>

61
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,569
tradition we established right away was

62
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,860
openness and inclusiveness our meetings

63
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:43,480
were open to all<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested parties and</font>

that the network would benefit all of

under the rubric of the

multi-stakeholder model to me that's a

80
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,470
fancy way of saying the process must be
