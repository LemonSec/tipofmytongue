00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,480
who have<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreed to answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font>

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,910
questions for us rod let's start with

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,300
you it's roughly about two months before

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:23,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld application window opens is</font>

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can ready we are ready and we've got a</font>

10
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,580
operating process we've set up to to

11
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:30,080
handle them in batches anyway so we're

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,759
ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle whatever a number of</font>

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,110
applications comes it'll just be a

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,410
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how much time it takes to</font>

15
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,300
process them Steve does the governmental

16
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">advisory committee so called early</font>

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,680
warning system mean in a de facto sense

18
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,610
that the governmental representatives

19
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:49,809
will have veto power over new gTLDs what

20
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:53,030
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> means is that they will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a solid</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">straight forward list of the strings</font>

22
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,040
being applied for have an opportunity to

23
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,840
comment on them raise any issues and

24
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,640
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're heard it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,140
veto power but it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high quality</font>

26
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,449
channel so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

27
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,829
miscommunication rod based upon

28
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:08,689
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked by some of the</font>

29
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:10,219
governmental advisory committee members

30
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:12,648
there appears to be some concern over

31
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:14,990
the practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> of so-called batching can</font>

32
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:17,929
you explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that is and is there a</font>

33
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,548
cause for concern for I can hear sure we

34
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:22,130
can receive any number of applications

35
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:23,569
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the window the application window but</font>

36
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,869
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> only going to process them in</font>

37
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:29,119
batches of 500 so we have to decide how

38
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:31,819
we're going to order those applications

39
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,909
that come in in those batches and

40
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:36,889
there's a complex set of legal and

41
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:39,020
technical issues involved and we're

42
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:40,969
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a solution pretty</font>

43
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,560
shortly and announced that so the GAC

44
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:44,208
had some questions about that and the

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,429
other thing they were interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

46
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:48,740
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> their early warning was going to</font>

47
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:50,060
be done in separate batches of 500 each

48
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,908
or whether they be asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide</font>

49
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">comment on all of the applications when</font>

50
00:01:52,909 --> 00:02:00,109
we publish the list of strings in May

51
00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:03,829
Steve what did the board do about trying

52
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:06,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">to assist potential new gtld applicants</font>

53
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:08,978
from emerging economies developing

54
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:12,080
countries those in need of assistance

55
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:13,460
well you may recall<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we previously</font>

56
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,950
allocated

57
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:19,040
fund of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 million</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars to be put</font>

58
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:21,530
forth to assist applicants we didn't put

59
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:26,269
precise specifications on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font>

60
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:28,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">be used we this time they were the joint</font>

61
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,600
applicants support so called jazz

62
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,660
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups submitted a very</font>

63
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:37,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">thoughtful and very heartfelt report</font>

64
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:39,620
with a whole list of recommendations the

65
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">board received that report and is</font>

66
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,260
committed to putting something sensible

67
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,150
in place that meets the<font color="#E5E5E5"> twin conditions</font>

68
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,970
of being responsive to that community

69
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,530
and at the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> fits into the</font>

70
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,470
what's practical to do with the program

71
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">so does that mean you're the board is</font>

72
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,920
endorsing the recommendations of the

73
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,020
reporter you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how</font>

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,929
to implement the major themes that run

75
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,840
through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ribbons closer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the latter</font>

76
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:08,360
want to be a bit careful because the

77
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,030
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> that put that together did not</font>

78
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,520
have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the business issues and</font>

79
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,640
business process issues at hand weren't

80
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:21,440
part of the rods team and and all of his

81
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:23,119
employees so we definitely take the

82
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,400
themes who definitely take the intent

83
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">and now we want to find out what's the</font>

84
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:32,360
best<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as close as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can to</font>

85
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:34,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that idea and still not break things</font>

86
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,680
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask both you gentlemen this was a</font>

87
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">subject of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of conversation not</font>

88
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,660
only if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting but in the last</font>

89
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:44,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting of seeing of that Singapore why</font>

90
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,760
is this so important I can I think it's

91
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of broadening out who we are and</font>

92
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,910
what we do and there's a recognition

93
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,120
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want a lot more</font>

94
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,620
participation from emerging markets

95
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,180
emerging countries around the world and

96
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">developing countries are really</font>

97
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,290
important and it's wonderful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

98
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,940
events<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we have here in Africa but</font>

99
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,760
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see them fully participating</font>

100
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,650
in this program<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cohen commonly said you</font>

101
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,230
know there's two billion users on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

102
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:12,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet that's not evenly distributed</font>

103
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,899
and there's quite a lot of attention not

104
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,548
just within I can but broadly around the

105
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,230
world of how to increase that

106
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:21,440
participation in the developing

107
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:23,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">countries and so I would view this as</font>

108
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,880
our part of how to participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

109
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">general thrust</font>

110
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,090
why is this so important this particular

111
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,730
subject matter and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> important is it</font>

112
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,830
to those potential applicants that may

113
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,930
exist here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the African continent for</font>

114
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,210
example sure well as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we have a</font>

115
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,380
slogan called one world one internet and

116
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,630
that means we want to keep the internet

117
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">open and unified globally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that means</font>

118
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,530
we really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> people from all over the</font>

119
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,260
world to benefit<font color="#CCCCCC"> from this unified</font>

120
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:53,200
domain name system and so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

121
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,700
applicants from developing<font color="#CCCCCC"> countries as</font>

122
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,620
well as from others and it's important

123
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:00,070
to them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel included so it has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

124
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,320
great psychic benefit and political

125
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,969
benefit for participants around the

126
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,570
world to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like they're going to get</font>

127
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,040

the participation in the developing

130

<font color="#CCCCCC">countries is a major theme for the next</font>

131
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,240
period of time it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> take quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

132
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:24,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">while and program that we're rolling out</font>

133
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:27,430
new gTLDs is a sort of our contribution

134
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:30,340
to how to extend the reach one element a

00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,160
Steve mentioned there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 billion users</font>

of the internet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world but</font>

145
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,250
there's many more of those in the

146
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,810
developing world than the developed than

147
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,970
in the developing world and that's

148
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,160
beginning to shift and we want to do

149
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything we can to help make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

the domain name services and<font color="#E5E5E5"> choices</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

151
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,350
opportunities are available all over the

152
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,030
world so because everyone everyone

153
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:13,810
matters it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be defined</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

154
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:15,460
inclusivity yes exactly Steve one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

155
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,280
controversies that has arisen over the

156
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,710
past few weeks is conflict of interest

157
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,530
or perceived conflicts of interest with

158
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,180
current or former board members what is

159
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:29,590
the board doing to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

160
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:32,230
concerns well we have always<font color="#CCCCCC"> had very</font>

161
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:35,169
tight conflict of interest policies

162
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:37,870
nonetheless it's been opportunity to

163
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:40,870
take a close look

164
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,850
at the policies at our ethics policies

165
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,800
to see if there's areas that can be

166
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,840
expanded or pieces that can be filled in

167
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,390
and then equally to look at our

168
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,979
practices that follow those policies and

169
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:57,330
to sharpen those at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board level we</font>

170
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:00,670
go through an ordinate amount of testing

171
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:03,340
about conflicts on in given situations

172
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,320
whether a particular board member is has

173
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">business relationships that might be</font>

174
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,580
perceived<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be related</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to something</font>

175
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,200
we're currently voting on we're in the

176
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,780
process of tightening things up even

177
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,849
more than drawing a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wider fat or</font>

178
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,250
lying around so that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just no</font>

179
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,140
issues rod what's I can't doing at a

180
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,290
staff level to deal with these same

181
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,940
types of concerns you know is continuous

182
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,590
education that we do there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

183
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,140
tightening<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've been doing since I</font>

184
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:31,330
mentioned this issue in June and my

185
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,550
speech and Singapore that I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:36,669
launching the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD program with the</font>

economic<font color="#E5E5E5"> power behind met was going to</font>

188
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,930
put new pressures on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board and on</font>

189
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,880
the staff we started tightening up

190
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,370
internally so it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> education and</font>

191
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's about drawing new lines such as at</font>

192
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,210
this event we educated our staff that

193
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,760
they were not to accept a free meal or a

194

free drink from anyone in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry</font>

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,870
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be a potential applicant for</font>

196
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,430
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> program and some people consider</font>

197
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,110
that draconian and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

198
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty clear and concrete and it was I</font>

199
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,890
was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> pleased</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so many people</font>

200
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,140
this event called talked about how you

201
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:08,530
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even give an employee of coke and</font>

202
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:10,360
that's right so I'm glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

203
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,940
concept stuck but it goes farther than

204
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we also decided that we would not</font>

205
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:18,280
have any staff members participate in

206
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:21,670
the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld Roadshow if they were</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">involved in processing applications we</font>

208
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,230
also decided that staff members should

209
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,060
report any<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact with potential</font>

210
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,290
applicants for new gTLDs who were

211
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,510
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them and asking questions</font>

212
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:34,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it so that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font>

213
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:36,939
documentation trail just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show how</font>

214
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,980
fair work we are in processing these

215
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:43,060
applications and how independent it is

216
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:46,000
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do have an important role in</font>

217
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:48,400
a quasi regulatory manner in some ways

218
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,150
and we've got to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely fair</font>

219
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,980
absolutely objective

220
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,140
extremely clean and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

221
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,940
do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've got a long way to</font>

222
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,100
go to keep educating and improving our

223
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,380
practices both on the board and on the

224
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,600
staff you seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be saying objectivity</font>

225
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:06,110
is not simply important in fact it has

226
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,640
to be perceived broadly we got to change

227
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,260
behavior<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

228
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,120
because as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned in Singapore</font>

229
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,850
we're moving from having crafted the

230
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,350
program and in crafting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the policies and</font>

231
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,690
the guidelines there was heavy

232
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,850
interaction between the board the staff

233
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,740
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community now we're moving to a</font>

234
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:25,040
phase where we're in the program

235
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,440
execution and that contact between the

236
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">board and applicants and between staff</font>

237
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,320
and applicants has to change because the

238
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:36,770
applications have got to be treated<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

239
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,720
independently and so fairly because some

240
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,699
of these new gTLDs can be worth many

241
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,950
millions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars and we can't have</font>

242
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,200
situations where those applicants are

243
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,600
lobbying board members or lobbying staff

244
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,760
members seeking to gain benefits for

245
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,530
themselves Steve there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been some</font>

246
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,140
questions raised as to whether the

247
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:58,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet root zone can handle the influx</font>

248
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:02,120
of new<font color="#CCCCCC"> TLDs well I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't want to say</font>

249
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:04,730
it's a not a valid concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's for</font>

250
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,340
those of us who actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand the</font>

251
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:10,400
dynamics and the how the root zone works

252
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:13,550
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is not a concern at all the</font>

253
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,350
root zone is a very very small when

254
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:18,109
we're talking about expanding it it's

255
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,670
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite small compared</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the other zones that are</font>

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,800
common across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet the root zone</font>

258
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:27,050
is a tiny tiny fraction<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what any of</font>

259
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,300
the major top-level domains are for

260
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:32,120
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> so from a technology point of</font>

261
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,729
view expanding the root zone is a really

262
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,530
very minor<font color="#E5E5E5"> manner what are the biggest</font>

263
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,710
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came out of this particular</font>

264
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:43,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting into car so certainly one of the</font>

265
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:46,670
primary and most interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspects was</font>

the focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Africa who had the African</font>

from<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the region participating</font>

270
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,430
also had interest in participation from

00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,709
the government level we have African

272
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:03,270
ministerial meeting three days leading

into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> icam meeting and</font>

00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:10,470
the same location<font color="#E5E5E5"> and is very focused on</font>

not only general ICT and not only

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:16,110
general internet issues but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused</font>

277
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:18,720
very much on what I can could do that

278
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:21,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful in this region the</font>

superficial they were very pointed and

284
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,640
it was pretty interesting engagement so

285
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,980
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite interested in that so that's</font>

286
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,990
one whole focus and a number of other

287

things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were maybe less visible</font>

288
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,070
along the same lines that I think we

289
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:47,000
