1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,180
we have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions or comments on</font>

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:09,330
root zone scaling and some of the the

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:13,379
data that we've been provided and how

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:19,680
this may relate to the the early warning

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:24,199
process and GAX role in that so are

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,198
there questions or comments on that

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,529
netherlands please our basic question I

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:35,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we discusses beforehand in in in</font>

9
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:39,660
plenary is the fact that we have a kind

10
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">of different expectations different</font>

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,910
wordings different signals in this

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:48,469
during this meeting then we had I think

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:53,339
in the Brussels meeting with the board

14
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:55,020
and basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we heard and we</font>

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,750
didn't hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in our let's say anything</font>

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,680
not in the presentation court gave to us

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:05,880
but it was in other in other setting

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:10,590
with Gina<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that it's probable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:13,979
thinkable that the I can can accommodate

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,729
it will accommodate let's say more than

21
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:21,210
500 or more than a couple of hundreds of

22
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:23,908
applications in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first round and I</font>

23
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,880
think it's of course it's admirable if

24
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,280
you can have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the systems and the</font>

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:35,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">processing the services</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are available on</font>

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:38,040
time but we still have I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,189
concerns one concern is that we had a

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,000
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of understanding in Brussels that</font>

29
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:46,380
after the first batch of we had a

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,200
thinking and understanding in a couple

31
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">of hundreds that will be a kind of</font>

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,899
evaluation about what's really the

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,219
impact of them let's say the first

34
00:01:53,899 --> 00:02:00,270
insurgents in the root zone<font color="#E5E5E5"> after a</font>

35
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:02,280
while and that second round would be

36
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,479
deferred until there's something coming

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,729
out out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

38
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:14,209
evaluation of how the root zone system

39
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:17,180
works or e acts on this so in case in

40
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:19,120
the first round there is not a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

41
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:23,630
batching but we have a let's say an

42
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:28,340
explosion of thousand or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1200</font>

43
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:32,959
applications it will of course interact

44
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:34,459
it will have repercussions of our own

45
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,970
let's head on<font color="#E5E5E5"> route scrolling route</font>

46
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:40,610
scaling agreement we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in in</font>

47
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:44,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Brussels on this and the second thing is</font>

48
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:47,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">will basically it depends also on how</font>

49
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:52,100
the batching is going to be arranged and

50
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:53,988
if you plan this introduction will this

51
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:59,150
be batched will this be one round and

52
00:02:53,989 --> 00:03:01,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">then if the applications come in after</font>

53
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,819
certain time will be in one time posting

54
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:06,319
of all the applications being in because

55
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:08,619
that's basically the trigger point for

56
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,649
our early warning within the cake and

57
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:15,590
our early warning is of course and we

58
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:19,310
have us all restricted resources if we

59
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:23,019
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a list of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1200 it's a</font>

60
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:27,019
little different than a list of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 150</font>

61
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:28,610
new applications so that's these two

62
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:29,900
questions we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> struggling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with and we</font>

63
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,329
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have some answer</font>

64
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,130
indication thank you so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there</font>

65
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:36,350
really are two quite different things

66
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,690
that we're talking about here the early

67
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,600
warning with respect to strings is a

68
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:44,299
process for review of those strings and

69
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,140
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking a question I believe about</font>

70
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:51,440
the capacity from a personal point of

71
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:54,048
view within the GAC and within the rest

72
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,510
of the administrative processes to

73
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:58,850
process those applications to do give

74
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,320
due consideration to those strings and

75
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,769
what the time frame is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those</font>

76
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:08,299
responses perfectly<font color="#E5E5E5"> fair question</font>

77
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:10,040
separate and apart from that is the the

78
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:13,299
terminology that you've used is the

79
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">impact on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the root server system which</font>

80
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:18,079
suggests that the name servers

81
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:22,840
themselves

82
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,840
would show some evidence of stress

83
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:34,509
because of the addition of new names

84
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:38,479
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> name servers that's it there's</font>

85
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:40,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">seems to be some persistent confusion</font>

86
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:45,438
and misunderstanding in my judgment

87
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:47,719
about that the the name servers the few

88
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,800
hundred anycast instances around the

89
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:55,969
world regularly process on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the order of</font>

90
00:04:51,800 --> 00:05:00,199
10,000 queries a day per second this is

91
00:04:55,969 --> 00:05:02,419
huge huge numbers the variation on a

92
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,550
second to second basis on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

94

day and at various you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes on a</font>

95
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:16,549

those<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers the addition of a new one</font>

00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:22,729
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two are a hundred or a thousand names</font>

98

into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the root server system almost</font>

99
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:28,219
certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> will generate no measurable</font>

change that you can that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

101
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:33,020
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ordinary changes that are</font>

102
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:35,960
ordinary variations that are taking it's

103
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,909
fair to look at that if you wish and and

104
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,270
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be people who are monitoring</font>

105
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:43,900
things very closely and I'm given to

106
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:47,568
understand there will be a report

107
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:50,029
carefully documented the before and

108
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:52,520
after and explaining all of this but I

109
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:57,169
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's important to set the</font>

110
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:59,839
expectations here that the relationship

111
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:02,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">between adding new names into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the root</font>

112
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:05,080
zone is almost completely if not a

113
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:06,979
hundred percent decoupled from anything

114
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">measurable in terms of the performance</font>

115
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:12,979
as seen by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the users or even for that</font>

116
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,529
matter seen by the internal distribution

117
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:20,990
processes within each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the roots of</font>

118
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:23,839
our operators<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I suspect that there is</font>

119
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:27,259
a misunderstanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has taken flower</font>

120
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:30,440
and seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be spread and I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

121
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:32,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">find a way to settle it down</font>

122
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,750
and as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think some very careful</font>

123
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,000
documentation structured in a way that

124
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:41,240
is readable not only by technical people

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,720
and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> gac personnel but also one that</font>

126
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,300
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> shared with broader audiences or</font>

127
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,380
more senior people in government would

128
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:53,240
be very helpful in laying this laying

129
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,090
out this very clearly and laying any

130
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">misunderstandings to rest as you may</font>

131
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:01,640
recall the board passed a resolution

132
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:03,860
that stated that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> maximum number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

135
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,539
annual basis is 1000 and the number may

136
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,750
not exceed that unless there's a formal

137
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:17,240
review or a new decision by the board so

138
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:19,790
that was the limit that was determined

139
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">and established by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> resolution and we</font>

will fully respect that thank you yeah i

141
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,979
would like to echo what my colleague

142

from from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mandamus was raising the</font>

also going to end up in our lap in this

163
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,919
reassuring from from our point of view

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's also very very important</font>

because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are governments we have</font>

thing what I what I got the impression

of them hope I understood it is also the

<font color="#E5E5E5">our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sec group had some kind of proposal</font>

the from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the technical perspective from</font>

that one or or or or also have you have

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,470
some dialogue on that one maybe you have

196
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,910
little bit like a parrot I saying the

197

same thing every every meeting when when

198
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,990
we have the opportunity to<font color="#CCCCCC"> meet you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,210
the ICANN board that I really hope that

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,120
we could I really hoped and I still do

201
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,580
it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have a limited first round</font>

202
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,100
and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good evaluation from all the</font>

203
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:58,200
perspectives this is necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

204
00:09:53,100 --> 00:10:00,270
take into account the the information we

205
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,990
got foot and then could move on to the

206
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:06,060
next step to the second round thank you

207
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,529
we love<font color="#CCCCCC"> live the word to the board if</font>

208
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">they want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> react immediately to this</font>

209
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:13,400
point and i will take the water

210
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:16,290
afterwards two<font color="#E5E5E5"> points the first one is</font>

211
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,600
related to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question at Thomas asked</font>

212
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:23,610
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and the and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer of</font>

213
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,560
Steve there is indeed a distinction that

214
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:29,610
is important<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Steve as are lighted</font>

215
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:33,469
and maybe one way to to highlight this

216
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:36,540
distinction is to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the stress on</font>

217
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:39,750
the root servers that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> distributed</font>

218
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:45,449
are more related<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the number of users</font>

219
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:48,180
that the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tlds this is a very</font>

220
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:50,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">important distinction overall on a daily</font>

221
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,770
functioning the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stress on the root</font>

222
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,730
servers is related to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number of</font>

223
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:58,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">users that are actually query</font>

224
00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:02,690
it will increase a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit because it</font>

225
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:06,290
will take time for the mirrors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

226
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:09,860
the cash and all the replications to get

227
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:13,880
all the addresses but overall the load

228
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:16,490
is not fundamentally related to the

229
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,550
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tles but more to the number of</font>

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:22,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">users the other stress which is</font>

231
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:26,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">different is the number of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> updates to</font>

232
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:29,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the database that come from changing the</font>

233
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,970
servers from changing the address of who

234
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,710
manages the registry and so on but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

235
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:38,120
is a completely different<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of load</font>

236
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:40,970
and I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to express that in a way</font>

237
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,740
that marks the distinction it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

238
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,900
important in our discussion that we are

239
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,420
completely clear about that distinction

240
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,490
because it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important element in</font>

241
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,650
relation to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root scaling and the</font>

242
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,380
dangers and it is extremely important in

243
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:56,810
particular that you have all the

244
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">elements to report back because this</font>

245
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,459
question is going to be asked over and

246
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,920
over again and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not clear tell</font>

247
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:06,590
us and we will clarify we will try to

248
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,959
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the arguments that you can use the</font>

249
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,880
second point is regarding the workload

250
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,710
on the early warning it's absolutely

251
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">true that the workload on the early</font>

252
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:17,990
warning will be heavier if there is a

253
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,930
thousand two hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> five hundred</font>

254
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,940
this is true<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we all know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem</font>

255
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:25,040
of bandwidth I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share and</font>

256
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,980
maybe make a methodological suggestion

257
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">because one of the dangers for everybody</font>

258
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,170
both for the board and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> staff the</font>

259
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:37,520
structure as a whole and for the gag is

260
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:40,760
if you want to provide a one single

261
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,590
early warning why is that because you

262
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,970
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to wait until you agree on</font>

263
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:48,710
every single potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds</font>

264
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,320
before you provide the output<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

265
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:53,840
suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you explore something along</font>

266
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,940
an important distinction among the list

267
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds hopefully there will not be too</font>

268
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,690
many that will be problematic but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

269
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,790
don't know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an important</font>

270
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,480
distinction between those where there is

271
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:07,490
a problem from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gac points of view</font>

272
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,300
regarding the string and to be

273
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,570
caricature

274
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:14,569
there may be strings or applications

275
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:17,240
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gac as a whole or some black</font>

276
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:19,220
members will say we don't even want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

277
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,100
explore who is applying for that string

278
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:24,740
that string is a problem this is

279
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,850
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a situation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where there</font>

280
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,250
is a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with one particular</font>

281
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,350
applicant for a given string that in

282
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,360
itself doesn't pose a problem because

283
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the early warning is much more</font>

284
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,100
directed towards the applicant<font color="#E5E5E5"> himself</font>

285
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,900
like saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> you didn't contact the</font>

286
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,970
corresponding local authority or you're

287
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:44,990
missing appointments so i would

288
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:49,520

calculated it on 100 what happens if you

373
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:19,630
happy to elaborate in May approximately

one month after the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application window</font>

375
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:25,059
closes we will be publishing all the

376
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:26,770
strings publicly so it's known what has

377
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:28,910
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> applied for and that will be the</font>

total list of whatever number

locations has been received during the

380
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:39,040
application period firstly secondly the

381
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:43,370
current plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to process the</font>

382
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,480
applications and batches of 500 so I

383
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that we've taken that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

consideration when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we looked at the the</font>

386
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:54,590
that in more depth and come back to you

<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you thank you rod so Suzanne first</font>

388
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,260
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to reinforce a couple of the</font>

389
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:02,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">points that have been made particularly</font>

390
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:04,460
by Steve the first of all given the

391
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,570
limitations<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have been committed to</font>

392
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:14,300
as rod<font color="#E5E5E5"> just mentioned and has previously</font>

393
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:16,730
discussed there's not an urgent issue

394
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:19,909
here there are concerns that are in

395
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,930
there it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> third there that do</font>

396
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:26,960
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be addressed and have been</font>

397
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:29,000
committed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be addressed but this is</font>

398
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,960
there there is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's more to be</font>

399
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,610
gained by taking the time to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

400
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,700
conversations and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

401
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:39,199
fully understand given that limits have

402
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,330
been agreed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are conservative in</font>

403
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:46,310
the minds of everyone who's looked

404
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:48,139
carefully at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for our sacks</font>

405
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,520
specifically I believe was Maria made a

406
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,620
reference to some work<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been</font>

407
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,010
undertaken there has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> some work</font>

408
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:59,330
within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> committee on a shared set of</font>

409
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:01,100
metrics as much in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interests of</font>

410
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,649
transparency and facilitating research

411
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,840
frankly as because there are specific

412
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:09,980
concerns for the root servers about rid

413
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,260
scaling and also I believe Steve made an

414
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,820
illusion I'm losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> track of who</font>

415
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:19,280
mentioned this but there are good

416
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:21,169
working relationships in place and the

417
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,260
technical folks outside of ICANN are

418
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,310
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward to working with staff on</font>

419
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,440
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that the technical issues</font>

420
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:29,750
are addressed it does make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense though</font>

421
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,550
to also reinforce the distinction that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

422
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,060
believe for tron particularly spoke to

423
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:38,120
between policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues and technical</font>

424
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:39,860
operational ones and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that one</font>

425
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,629
of the benefits of the long discussion

426
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,060
that

427
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:46,540
we we all had on this issue was that

428
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:48,760
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a reasonable set of clear</font>

429
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:50,379
separations among those things and

430
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,670
regional plans for tackling all of them

431
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:56,230
so I I think we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a good place on</font>

432
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,850
that but we need to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving forward</font>

433
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,190
in and we look forward to working

434
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:03,070
particularly with the staff on them ok

435
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:05,380
Germany I just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back to the</font>

436
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,990
presentation made by petrol in this

437
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:13,180
respect on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> evaluation process and</font>

438
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:16,000
early warning system I just I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

439
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:19,650
seems your comment seems to be rather

440
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,170
sensible to have a distinction<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

441
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:25,330
as a aberration of the string on one

442
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:29,380
side<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other side revelation of</font>

443
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:31,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">the applicant having said that from a</font>

444
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:34,870
practical standpoint that might be

445
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:36,880
rather difficult because imagine we

446
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:42,750
receive on the first of May or second of

447
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:47,590
May or 29th of April a complete list

448
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:53,020
with strings<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay a string of evaluation</font>

449
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:57,459
is rather easy to be made the rather

450
00:20:53,020 --> 00:21:00,940
easy just to say but an evaluation of

451
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,740
the applicant and in particular it's not

452
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">only the name of the applicant you need</font>

453
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:09,640
to know what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the model he is</font>

454
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:12,370
following what are the registration

455
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,550
policies what are the restrictions I

456
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:19,620
think this frankly speaking is not

457
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:23,290
possible within a time frame of 60 days

458
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:25,300
this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I would really be</font>

459
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:29,379
hesitated to have such kind of

460
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:33,580
evaluation during this period and having

461
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:35,550
said said I also would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to second my</font>

462
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:41,490
colleague<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the European Commission I</font>

463
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:43,690
think we we only need to consider what

464
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:45,310
will be the possibilities for the

465
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">government</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the early warning system</font>

466
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:53,050
if say is really a significant decrease

467
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:54,100
of application we had considered up to

468
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:57,240
now

469
00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:01,510
something like 500 if it really is

470
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:04,360
significantly more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than these 500 then</font>

471
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:08,700
it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be also a capacity problems for</font>

472
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:11,020
us to proceed these 500 CC's

473
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:15,030
applications because yet we as

474
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:18,370
government have not privileged to extend

475
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:20,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">at a time we are bound by a 60 days</font>

476
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:24,549
thank you thanks who<font color="#CCCCCC"> burped for your</font>

477
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:26,320
question we will publish the

478
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:28,510
applications which are essentially

479
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,559
questioned the information in questions

480
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:34,840
1 through 13 so and and then more so

481
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,970
there'll be the string and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

482
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:40,389
applicant and the purpose of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">the questions so that the gap can use</font>

that to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make its determinations now what</font>

might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful for the GAC and what</font>

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,470
we'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear is a way thank you</font>

488
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:55,840
I've you know so maybe there's a way we

489
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">can sort the data so we're planning as</font>

490
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,590
rod mentioned we're going to we're going

491
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:02,470
to publish that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information on a</font>

00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:05,860
date certain after<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> received the</font>

493
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,539

494
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,918
that information to you now what's going

495
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:11,679
to be published and perhaps you could

496
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:13,990
get back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us with a way that we could</font>

497
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,880
sort that data so it'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more helpful</font>

498
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,860
to you so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of run your</font>

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,980
finger down it easily Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Curt</font>

500
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:23,678
switzerland in principle it would be

501
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,720
useful to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> express an early</font>

502
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,059
warning first on the string and then on

503
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,240
second level on the applicant<font color="#CCCCCC"> and/or on</font>

504
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:33,610
his business model but something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

505
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,380
start to realize which is in at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

506
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,030
my head slightly reducing the value of

507
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,789
this whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> early warning system and I</font>

508
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:42,940
put it as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question due to the board is</font>

509
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:44,530
my perception write that in case we

510
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,880
would realize that there is a string

511
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:48,039
with that we do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

512
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,230
problematic we look at the applicant and

513
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:52,690
then we look at his business models

514
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,510
already registrar conditions whatever

515
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:58,299
and and then realize that something is

516
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:00,429
not applicable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our law in our country</font>

517
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:01,990
and then you issue an early warning

518
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:03,640
saying like basically everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

519
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:06,429
be fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we have a problem there we</font>

520
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,130
cannot accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> this what is the use of</font>

521
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:10,310
this if

522
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:13,160
if i<font color="#E5E5E5"> get is right that if the applicant</font>

524
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,290
with with droid is that right that's the

00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:20,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">only answer you can give unless this</font>

exception with geographic names and

527
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,470
seeking government support but if if you

528
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,500
for instance in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> early warning detect</font>

529
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:29,120
a minor flaw which would cause you to to

530
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,450
to file an objection against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

531
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,919
applicant can only decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go</font>

532
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:36,650
nevertheless or I withdraw there's

<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing in between is that right and and</font>

534
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:44,450
then yeah that's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking Kurt</font>

535
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:48,290
please so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> question reflects a good</font>

536
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:50,900
understanding we're we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> loathe to</font>

537
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:53,000
allow applicants to fully change their

538
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,460
application because that would allow

539
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,060
applicants to abuse the system get an

540
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:00,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">application in as a test and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that has</font>

541
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of fails they can sort of get</font>

542
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,450
around the system by amending it but

543
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,360
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways an applicant can address</font>

544
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:11,090
government concerns for example in the

545
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,399
case of a geographic name<font color="#CCCCCC"> McCann</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> secure</font>

546
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:16,070
the approval of the government or there

547
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,380
may be conditions at government would

548
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,810
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> before would otherwise approved</font>

549
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:23,780
delegation of a name so it can put the

550
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:26,179
applicant on notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the gac will</font>

551
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,310
probably give<font color="#CCCCCC"> jack advice or encourage</font>

552
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:31,070
an objection in some way so there are

553
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:33,290
ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> for governments to use the early</font>

554
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,419
warning effectively and then the of

555
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:37,129
course the other use for<font color="#CCCCCC"> gac advice is</font>

556
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,660
to put the applicant on notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

557
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:41,630
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gak advice or an</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity to withdraw early for a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">encourage the applicants to heed the gac</font>

00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:54,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">had early warning in that way Thank You</font>

563
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:58,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Curt patron want very quick comments</font>

564
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:03,530
both on Herbert and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Thomas's</font>

565
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:08,870
questions what way of trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in</font>

566
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:11,990
place is a communication channel and and

567
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:15,439
the whole discussion we had during the

568
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:18,429
elaboration of the applicant<font color="#E5E5E5"> guidebook</font>

569
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:24,490
is to identify

570
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:28,029
tools for interaction not box the

571
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:30,279
capacity<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the gac in particular to</font>

572
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:34,240
make a comment at one moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not</font>

573
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:39,009
later and so on what was attempted was

574
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:42,580
to provide a way for intervening at

575
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:44,619
different stages and there are as<font color="#CCCCCC"> thomas</font>

576
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:48,699
has said there are different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:58,629
having an interface or something that is

facilitating the interaction is in this

581
00:26:58,629 --> 00:27:03,039
period of what we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put in</font>

and the early warning<font color="#E5E5E5"> bears its its name</font>

584
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:11,440
very well identifying problems as early

585
00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:13,090
as possible is beneficial<font color="#CCCCCC"> for everybody</font>

588
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:21,129
where there is a general problem with

589
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:23,649
the string there are cases where there

590
00:27:21,129 --> 00:27:25,389
is a specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem for one or several</font>

591
00:27:23,649 --> 00:27:28,600

00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:30,580
string them should have done<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

or will not withdraw in the end but what

600
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">i would like to highlight here is the</font>

601
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:53,559
notion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a continuous process that will</font>

00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:05,559
protections as a general remarkable what

606
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:07,059
we've all attempted to do is to find

607
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:09,399
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that combines two very</font>

608
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:12,249

00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:28,998
sure that there is always an avenue for

00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:31,069
interaction when there's

616
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:34,129
problem I think that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best answer</font>

617
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:36,109
we can give at that moment and the

618
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:38,718
questions that you are asking we need to

619
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:40,609
keep asking them in parallel with using

620
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:43,429
the process so that we improve it as

621
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:45,769
much as we as we move forward you said

622
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:48,199
in case there would be more than 500 you

623
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:49,999
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> divide this in batches of 500 that</font>

624
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:52,539
you would proceed kind of one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

625
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:55,099
other in case you receive four thousand

626
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:56,929
applications how do you decide which

627
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:58,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">ones up going to be in the first batch</font>

629
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,268

00:29:00,469 --> 00:29:04,669
the date that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually hand in the</font>

658
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:15,859
we process those applications in batches

659

and the current intention is to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

660
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:20,599
in a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of around 500 per batch so</font>

661
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,449
it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's a higher number</font>

662
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:25,009
than 500 then we will need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do some</font>

00:30:23,449 --> 00:30:28,539
batch processing if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers lower</font>

yes they'll all be buck sorry they'll

a telephone<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh sorry the microphone just</font>

673
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:53,410
one I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> very essential question</font>

674
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:56,320
about remediating an application<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

675
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:58,250
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you don't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

676
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,189
applicants gaming the system and

677
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:03,169
changing their application but in

678
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:06,620
certain cases which are not only

679
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:09,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">geographic but also others like dot</font>

680
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:12,409
sector an example of whatever sector

681
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:15,919
imagine just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very had to have a</font>

682
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:18,770
concrete<font color="#CCCCCC"> example imagine that after</font>

683
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,830
talks with with gang members after<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

684
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:24,440
early warning that the registry would

685
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:26,689
then maybe make a stricter policy and

686
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,450
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example that on the second level</font>

687
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:31,760
there is organization dot sector and he

688
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:34,789
would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want this to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

689
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,799
stricter for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> a registered name</font>

690
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:41,320
from organization on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second level</font>

691
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:45,200
but with a minimum of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten countries</font>

692
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:47,689
existent origins my question basically

693
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,570
it's on and on what extent do you have

694
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:52,730
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibility of having a stricter</font>

695
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:55,189
policy which will then alleviate

696
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:57,470
concerns of them of some governments or

697
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:59,350
the whole gig thank you so what the

698
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:01,940
guidebook says is that an applicant

699
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:04,399
cannot materially change their

700
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,830
application and it's interesting to talk

701
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,419
about specific examples like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but I</font>

702
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:11,449
don't I don't want to give an indication

703
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:13,880
whether a certain specific example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

704
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,500
change would be allowable because we

705
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,020
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maintain the goals of making it</font>

706
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,270
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> gay mobile but we also understand</font>

707
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:23,900
that you know a registry might want to

708
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:25,760
further restrict its its application

709
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:30,409
make it more now<font color="#CCCCCC"> in order to bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

710
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:33,820
into into the the goals of what the

711
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:36,409
government has so there's some limited

712
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,689
opportunity to adjust how they're going

713
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:41,690
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> operate the registry without amending</font>

714
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:44,900
their application so as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

715
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:46,909
within those guidelines of getting to

716
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,080
the goal of not being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gain but</font>

717
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:50,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">other than that I don't want to really</font>

718
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:54,309
comment on a specific application<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>
