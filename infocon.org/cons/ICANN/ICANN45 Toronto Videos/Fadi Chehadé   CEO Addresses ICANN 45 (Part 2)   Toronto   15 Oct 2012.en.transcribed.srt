14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,710
know where is every dollar of the 74

million dollars we're spending this year

16

goes what is it being spent on for what

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,200
and who owns it what are the

when the system is completely up and

running I will expose it to you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

check what's going on this is

accountability and this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will</font>

be doing without a system like that I

cannot confess that I manage I can for

us accountable for everything we do and

30
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,689
it will certainly stabilize the

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,060
situation because right now a lot of

management we need to get into steady

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,810
mode again this is pretty

35
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:34,020
straightforward it's a change of culture

36
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:37,890
maybe but it's steady we will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,289
done this second<font color="#E5E5E5"> and very important bit</font>

38
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,570
shows you how we plan to change the

structural change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that allows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,229
achieve our goals this is important

44
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it was my way to understand what</font>

45
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,850
happens at I can so I took all the

46

50
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,050
we're pulling it out and making it the

51
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,970
key

52
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,450
top area we're going to be doing in

order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to embrace the world public</font>

54
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:23,630

<font color="#E5E5E5">listening and not just listening and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">then going dark listening engaging</font>

building relationships advocating things

58

together that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> engagement is and</font>

59
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,920
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very important and you know on</font>

60
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:43,160
my first day on the job I brought both

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">important and it will change the way we</font>

64
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:55,520
engage in a structured planned way on a

65
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:59,240
global basis and both of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not</font>

67
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:05,000
have leaders into the leadership team

68
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,100
who will be based outside the United

our core technical functions which give

us<font color="#E5E5E5"> the legitimacy and the role we have</font>

certainly the security stability and

80
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,530
today these have been services offered

81
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,870
by various areas within I can we're now

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:54,140
a single managed area and we will have

84
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:57,200
new business leadership looking at that

85
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:04,040

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:57,729
attention on the affirmation of

147
00:06:54,370 --> 00:07:00,280
commitment commitments that we made and

148
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:02,949
make them part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we work and</font>

149
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,460
this is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> area of focus</font>

150
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:08,259
for me now let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me finish this slide by</font>

151
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:13,049
explaining to you how all of this will

152
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:15,310
work so we're going to create local

153
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:19,270
responsibilities and you notice that

154
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:21,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">only the top six areas have local</font>

155
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,620
responsibilities because stakeholder

156
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,860
support and governance support cannot be

157
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,539
localized these are global functions but

158
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,880
the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the functions will be</font>

159
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:32,560
localized what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mean for those</font>

160
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,530
of you who have not lived through the

plan to do through next calendar year it

00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,530
means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll give you an example</font>

164
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,169
somebody could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in the communications</font>

173

organization but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just doing it</font>

174
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:10,360
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good looking slide we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

175
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,280
are moving to change all of our HR

evaluated and paid based on their matrix

178
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:21,669
success so we put our actions where our

179
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:24,280
words are we turn and I've done this

180
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:27,099
before built matrix<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations seen</font>

them fail seen them do very well we know

182
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:32,740
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this will work this will enable</font>

183
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:35,708
people to no longer be in their silo

184
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,570
departmental areas but rather understand

185
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,968
that they are part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a global team and</font>

186
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,289
it is equally their responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

187
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:44,020
make sure that their local

188
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:44,740
responsibilities do occur now for those

189
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,079
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you trying</font>

190
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,240
to read through<font color="#E5E5E5"> my slide are we going to</font>

191
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,880
have three regional offices for regional

192
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,190
offices please don't this is detail

193
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,100
let's first focus on getting the model

194
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:59,320
right and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how we best</font>

195
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,240
get close to our stakeholders and we

196
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,940
will open whatever offices are needed

197
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,430
but that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> my priority my priority</font>

198
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,350
is to think how do we get closer faster

199
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:10,750
to our stakeholders and talk to them

200
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:13,180
locally so they understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

201
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:16,810
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them and how we can help them</font>

202
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:20,649
get successful so that's our new

203
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:24,040
delivery structure this will make<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

204
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:26,800
international this will provide us<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

205
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the integration and I will tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

206
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,410
quite frankly I can is very siloed

207
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:36,190
inside it's a very siloed organization

208
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:38,170
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> cannot stay that cannot stay I</font>

209
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,089
cannot have a department not know what

210
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,709
another department is doing so the

211
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:43,480
management system by the way which I

212
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:45,849
showed you on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last slide is not by</font>

213
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">Department it's completely done by</font>

214
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,899
program and initiative so it takes a

215
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:52,779
siloed organization and turns it upside

216
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:54,579
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and cuts everything this way this</font>

217
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:56,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">is quite a bit of change and it will</font>

218
00:09:54,579 --> 00:10:05,949
take time to implement all of this but I

219
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:09,370
already<font color="#CCCCCC"> started I already started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

220
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:11,200
many people are looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at me to make</font>

221
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:14,589
all this happen but I cannot make this

222
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,440
happen without help there's no way there

223
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:19,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">is just an incredible amount of work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

224
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,060
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done at I can so we have new</font>

00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:31,060
i promised you i'll do that a comet

229

allah will look after the core technical

230
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:35,349
services so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can continue delivering</font>

231
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,329
them with the excellence you expect and

232
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,120
he will also<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I said own the</font>

organizational support functions Sally

will be responsible for our<font color="#E5E5E5"> public and</font>

237
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,230
stakeholder engagement all the

238
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,880
capacity-building functions the

239
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,990
collaboration platforms we will build

240
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,550
and certainly on the communication side

241
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,209
Tarak camel will lead the government

242
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,079
engagement

243
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:00,819
and I know some of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are already</font>

244
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:02,319
saying hey why do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have someone just</font>

245
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:05,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">for government engagement are they</font>

246
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:07,959
special well because what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found out</font>

247
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:10,209
happens through the summer listening

248
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:12,219
phase which by the way never stops I

249
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:13,959
will keep listening but what I found

250
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,029
that happens is governments often

251
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:19,300
because of their unique ways they're

252
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:22,029
demanding protocols etc end up siphoning

253
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:24,550
a lot of the energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> from engagement so</font>

254
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:26,499
by separating these two I actually will

255
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,378
allow focus finally on all the

256
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:31,600
stakeholders and yet give<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments</font>

257
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:34,600
the proper deference the proper

258
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,490
attention by a senior very experienced

259
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,559
person like Tareq ex-minister of

260

telecommunications of Egypt someone who

261

I hate to admit when I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> with him to</font>

262
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,230

00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:38,230
all the decisions let me be clear on

308
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:43,389
this JJ is doing his job what wasn't

309
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:46,480
happening is others doing their job we

310
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:50,170
balance things we deal with things in an

311
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,209
executive smart calm way and then the

312
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:55,149
input that comes from our great legal

313
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:57,429
team becomes part of the input and John

00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:59,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jeffrey and I are one hundred percent in</font>

315
00:13:57,429 --> 00:14:01,179

00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:05,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">moving forward</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the way we work at i</font>

00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:08,860
can now this is not a pretty face yet

318
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,889
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted to make sure you appreciate</font>

319
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:14,769
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plan to bring a very senior</font>

324
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:27,990
important because again this is an area

325
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:30,910
that in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion has been a bit</font>

326
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:33,459
muddled inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

327
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:36,339
all over the place we we own it we do

328
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:39,429
what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the focus on it to make</font>

00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:41,889
it an area of service excellence is very

330
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:45,119
important so we will be bringing someone

on board that will help<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in this area</font>

332
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:51,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">so now I juxtapose the pictures and the</font>

333
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,579
last slide so we're clear who owns what

334
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:57,459
ownership is the first and<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:59,949
important step of accountability<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

336
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:04,059
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very clear who owns what</font>

and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will manage now I put</font>
