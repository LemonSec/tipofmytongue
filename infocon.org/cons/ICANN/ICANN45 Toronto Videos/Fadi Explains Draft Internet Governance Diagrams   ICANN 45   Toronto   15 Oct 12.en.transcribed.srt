1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
when we have some new interesting things

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are happening we're going to post</font>

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,189
them on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> homepage and in that first</font>

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,480
home page<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to show you</font>

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,090
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I want to bring to your</font>

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,920
attention and this is interesting

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,850
because when Sally and I joined I can

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,000
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first things we asked for can</font>

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:24,480
we get a picture that describes how

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,090
internet governance works and generally

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,130
we got horrified looks what do you mean

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,560
a picture that tells you<font color="#CCCCCC"> how the</font>

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet governance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok how about a</font>

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,530
picture how I can works well yeah here's

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,809
here's forty pages go read them maybe

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,030
we're simple people but I think a

17
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,739
picture would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really helpful so we</font>

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,739
started putting together an effort and

19
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,570
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually reached out also to the rirs</font>

20
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,500
and other I star organizations to get

21
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,840
their ideas so here on the right is

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,239
literally a<font color="#E5E5E5"> doodle the initial doodles</font>

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,510
and we're offering them to you so you

24
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">can go and give us input on them so</font>

25
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,110
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first doodle we're working on</font>

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,810
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how the multi-stakeholder</font>

27
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet Governance works who's who what</font>

28
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,310
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do right this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just an it's</font>

29
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,229
not the finished product it's just a

30
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,780
sketch but we're starting to work on it

31
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,520
this is now on my I can so please go

32
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,229

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,390

34
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,670

35
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,920
of us in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> few months when we go</font>

36
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,420
to wicked to various environments we

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,100
mean government's who are explaining to

38
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,100

44
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:47,759
and we did the same thing for and I can

45

48
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,590
one but please again it's out there on

49

52
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,039
