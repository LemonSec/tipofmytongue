00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,910
gentlemen we're here at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ICANN</font>

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,189
45 in Toronto Steve what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,680
takeaways for the week this was first of

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,360
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very very good week we have the</font>

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">advantage of course that Fadi has</font>

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:19,039
stepped in very firmly and has just<font color="#CCCCCC"> made</font>

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:21,409
it enormously positive impression

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,289
everybody and even beyond the positive

9
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:28,159
impression has taken multiple steps and

10
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:31,339
every across every front and the the

11
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:34,489
community response is overwhelmingly

12
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:37,339
positive and so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes it pretty</font>

13
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:41,718
easy from my point of view it's a great

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:43,940
position for us to be in progress across

15
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,980
every front body what are your

16
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,489
observations coming out of your first I

17
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:52,608
can meeting a CEO the community wants

18
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:55,038
the work done at i can and i feel that

19
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:58,640
during this week they saw themselves

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,699
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a new leadership and a new</font>

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,040
spirit that will allow us to get our

22
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:06,649
work done here and it's frankly<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,160
assigned to the world as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well that i can</font>

24
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:13,280
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can as a place where civil</font>

25
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:17,149
society governments businesses users can

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,330
all come and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the business they need</font>

27
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,730
done it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can efficiently there are</font>

28
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,130
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to do to improve but</font>

29
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,830
certainly this week showed that the will

30
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,929
to get there is in place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're in</font>

31
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,940
motion<font color="#E5E5E5"> now buddy we've heard nothing but</font>

32
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,530
praise about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your leadership style but</font>

33
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,090
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of this meeting does this</font>

34
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,820
mean your honeymoon period has come to

35
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:41,180
an end look the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only honeymoon period</font>

36
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:45,139
I'm worried about is the one where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

37
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:50,480
can all look back and say we had our

38
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:53,840
best effort put in to<font color="#E5E5E5"> improve what I can</font>

39
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,850
needs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do and deliver that's the only</font>

40
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,980
thing that matters to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me it is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

41
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,320
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people coming together</font>

42
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:05,180
and feeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're moving forward</font>

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the work at I can so frankly I hope</font>

44
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,770
we stay in this

45
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:13,290
it we stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this openness I've seen</font>

46
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">people several times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this week cross to</font>

47
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:19,440
the other side of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> line and listen to</font>

48
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,420
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other party and actually react and</font>

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,240
embrace<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other party's position at</font>

50
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes this is how communities get</font>

51
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,510
their work done<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's what I hope</font>

52
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,160
lasts let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> new gTLDs shortly</font>

53
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,890
before this meeting began we announced

54
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> prioritization draw what sort of</font>

55
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,380
reaction are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing overwhelmingly</font>

56
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,570
positive why because it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> a perfect</font>

57
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:46,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution for one group or another group</font>

58
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:49,590
or it's the positive reaction is we have

59
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,700
a solution it works let's move forward

60
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,860
so I feel that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a a collective</font>

61
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:00,660
sigh of relief that we have a mechanism

62
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:03,090
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is equitable that is fair that is a</font>

63
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">very transparent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and simple in many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font>

64
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">that allows us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to move forward and the</font>

65
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,770
surprising part was the proposal to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

66
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,290
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> international domain names first the</font>

67
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,140
ideas first many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that</font>

68
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,190
this will have a maybe a visceral

69
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">reaction from some members of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

70
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:23,550
community quite remarkably people are

71
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:28,530
embracing that idea in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

72
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:32,100
biggest applicants to new gTLDs in my

73
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:36,150
office came in and agreed with me that

74
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:39,390
this shows that the new leadership that

75
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,360
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just in I can't staff but the new</font>

76
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,700
leadership spirit across the community

77
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,820
agrees that in the public interest and

78
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,500
in our focus on global outreach this is

79
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,010
the right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to do how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

80
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,750
envision the day of the draw so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

81
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,739
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> straightforward we're going to</font>

82
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,620
have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people who purchase their</font>

83
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,390
tickets to the draw have their tickets

84
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,090
placed in a

85
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:08,579
in a drawing we will draw them one at a

86
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,080
time literally of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will be</font>

87
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,060
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the supervision of an</font>

88
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,450
independent auditor that will be there

89
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:19,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it will also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be available online</font>

90
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:22,010
live for everyone to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see and we will</font>

91
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:25,860
come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that with a very specific</font>

92
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:29,490
draw number for each of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1923</font>

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:32,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications as these draw numbers get</font>

94
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,190
handed then they'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll become</font>

95
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,880
the mechanism by which we advance<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

96
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:41,430
through the multiple gates in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

97
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,770
process of delegation Steve why didn't

98
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,440
we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the prioritization draw in</font>

99
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:49,130
the beginning why go through digital

100
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:55,010
archery which was never<font color="#E5E5E5"> well received</font>

101
00:04:49,130 --> 00:05:00,780
well it's a good question and one that's

102
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:05,310
puzzled a number of us originally the

103
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:07,500
notion of a random selection was viewed

104
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,620
and through the lens<font color="#E5E5E5"> of calling it a</font>

105
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,210
lottery and that triggered legal

106
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,910
opinions has said this was this was

107
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,140
illegal and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that caused us to go off in</font>

108
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:21,600
a different direction and try this

109
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:24,030
digital archery and so forth revisiting

110
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,830
the question about random selection and

111
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,359
and fadi actually gets an enormous

112
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,460
credit for asking the most

113
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,220
straightforward<font color="#E5E5E5"> question like why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

114
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,900
we do this caused it to be rethought and

115
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:38,070
looked at through a somewhat different

116
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:42,530
lens of the way churches do raffles and

117
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:46,560
so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sudden of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

118
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:48,900
mists parted and we could see<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

119
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,870
clearly how to do this Steve<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

120
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:55,140
rights protection mechanisms adequate

121
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:59,039
well you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ask the people who</font>

122
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:00,719
are in continual<font color="#E5E5E5"> II concerned and keep</font>

123
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,430
raising<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bar the answer from their</font>

124
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,750
point of view will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be well it's not</font>

125
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:09,690
sufficient yet there's no absolutely

126
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,320
perfect answer but enormous amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

127
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:15,090
attention has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been put on the</font>

128
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:18,730
given to this and lots of mechanisms for

129
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:20,979
protecting rights so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say in the</font>

130
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,860
main the answer is yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

131
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,600
satisfy<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody know are we going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

132
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,760
have a workable system I think clearly

133
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,870
yes finally let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you about the</font>

134
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:34,800
objection mechanisms are they adequate I

135
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:37,360
think we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> reached a very good</font>

136
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,330
arrangement that everyone seems to

137
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,600
accept we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to extend the</font>

138
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:45,460
objection period to March thirteenth we

139
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,770
are waiting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community to comment</font>

140
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,030
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly hopefully they</font>

141
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:53,620
will accept our proposal it is not quite

142
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,419
where some people wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to stay in</font>

143
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,370
January<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's not quite where some</font>

144
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,870
people wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to June but</font>

145
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,150
sometimes the middle of the way

146
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,370
solutions get<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody on the same page</font>

147
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,590
and i hope the community accepts our

148
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:09,130
proposition to extend them a little bit

149
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:11,349
and allow people to react in time and we

150
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,820
move forward talk to me about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Raa</font>

00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,479
on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> on indeed indeed and I know</font>

154
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,849
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are very frustrated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

this year the first one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously to</font>

159
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,780
get the trademark Clearinghouse to work

160
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:40,690
as best as possible for all parties to

161
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:44,559
agree we have a mechanism that can

162
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:47,010
satisfy the interests of the parties the

163
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,570
second one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the RA without question</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to be inserting myself</font>

165
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:55,390
personally in both these<font color="#E5E5E5"> including the</font>

166
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,340
RA and I've already discussed this with

167
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:01,950
members of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community and there is</font>

168
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:04,599
frankly universal agreement that if I

169
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:08,409
participate personally into these

170
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:11,320
activities I would help the activities

171
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:14,770
come to hopefully reasonable conclusions

172
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:18,310
that we can all bank on and move forward

173
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:20,140
to next year and the new gTLDs farley

174
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,460
given the reaction the very positive

175
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,590
reaction about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the things that</font>

176
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've promised are you at all concerned</font>

00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:30,190
live up to those promises<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am I am</font>

00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:33,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">always concerned to meet the commitments</font>

180
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:36,429
I made and it's it's I rarely make

181
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:39,520
commitments lightly these are very very

182
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:42,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">important matters at hand so one of the</font>

183
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:46,449
things I'm going to do to put everyone

184
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:49,000
in a very clear understanding of what is

185
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,040
it that I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is after Toronto i</font>

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,540
will take the time with my team and in

191
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:06,550
publish that to the whole community so

192
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:11,890
that people are clear what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

194
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:16,480
joint understand and this will be a

195
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:19,360
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our scorecard and that's</font>

196
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that exposes us to commitments but</font>

197
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,660
frankly that's what I'm here to do and i

198
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:27,790
will put all my team all of the staff on

199
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:32,079
call to actually deliver on these things

200
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:34,030
as best I can Steve given<font color="#CCCCCC"> fadis focus on</font>

201
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,980
internationalization do you have any

202
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:39,790
major concerns going into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IGF</font>

203
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:43,860
meeting in Baku I think we're basically

204
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:46,060
in very good shape in that regard the

205
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,200
the emphasis that we're putting on

206
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:52,869
internationalization as you say is now

207
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,310
made quite firmly and visibly and to the

208
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,410
world we've said that we've said that

209
00:09:54,310 --> 00:10:01,180
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking steps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in each area</font>

210
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:05,170
substantial effort in Africa<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that's</font>

211
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:07,660
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a process of looking</font>

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:12,280
at every region every sub region

213
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:14,170
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the globe and I think</font>

214
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:18,189
over a period of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll have an</font>

215
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:19,810
enormous impact on the way I can and I

216
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,370
cans effectiveness I'm actually getting

217
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:24,430
our job done and on the way that we're

218
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:27,310
viewed and interactions with governments

219
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:29,050
interactions with technical community

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,959
interactions with business community<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

221
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:34,479
so forth funny let me ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you as we get</font>

222
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,899
closer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting in Dubai</font>

223
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,290
in December voices are becoming more

224
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:42,779
elevated which will probably increase as

225
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,730
we get closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that meeting are you at</font>

226
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:47,639

227
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:51,660
concerned if we do our part and our part

228
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:53,160
is to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world that I can works to</font>

community not just an intergovernmental

232
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:07,139
community that makes decisions together

233
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:10,769
including all voices so my focus is not

234
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:13,319
on the ITU my focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on getting our</font>

00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,509
interval between meetings we typically

288
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:35,670
have there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes the shortest</font>

289
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:37,290
three months<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes as long as five</font>

290
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:41,370
months this one is even a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer</font>

291
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:43,680
at six months so there'll be a great

292
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:47,339
emphasis on what gets done between now

293
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,099
and then and what progress were able to

294
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:53,100
show as you said earlier there's a

295
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:56,189
number of promises on the table and by

296
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,839
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we get to Beijing there will be</font>

297
00:13:56,189 --> 00:14:01,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">expectations that there will have been</font>

298
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:05,990
delivery across many of those promises

299
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:09,000
so this will be a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenging time</font>

300
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,949
that is less visible as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

301
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,170
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of no meetings and because of</font>

302
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:16,859
holidays and so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yet I'm</font>

303
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:18,899
expecting that there will be substantial

304
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,939
progress you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick it you talked</font>

305
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:24,899
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the are a battle is that will be</font>

306
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:26,579
history<font color="#E5E5E5"> by that time I'm sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld</font>

307
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">program will be in a whole different</font>

308
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:32,309
shape will be well underway the drawing

309
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:34,829

310
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:37,709
just go down the line there's there'll

311
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:42,540
be a Triphammer effect of a many

312
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:45,508
different things so here in Toronto

314

positive expectations built up by the

315
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:53,399
time we get to Beijing I think we will

316
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,920
also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an extraordinary positive</font>

317
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,420
feeling and it will be built<font color="#CCCCCC"> upon my</font>

318
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,579
