they're laughing were talking to their

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,909
you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the vibrations got</font>

00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,349
the applications must go through

contract execution phase<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

7
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:29,900
obligation testing and then if there's

00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:37,680
any objections or compassion at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Haskell</font>

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:42,450
be resolved and then delegation

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:50,370
and we know that essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> deliver</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:54,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">vibrations also all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time so I would</font>

12
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:57,150
bash them or meter them or process them

13
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:03,650
through an operation that has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

14
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:07,259
amount of capacity and ability

15
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:11,550
requirements which means delegate more

16
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:16,140
than a thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> to gTLDs a year and do</font>

17
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:17,490
that in kind of a smooth way so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

18
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,860
know there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been some trial and error</font>

19
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:25,860
in developing this methodology we think

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,200
this latest proposal that's published 30

21
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,789
days for comments so<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20-something days</font>

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,729
now is based on you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community</font>

23
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,580
feedback which has been exhaustive

24
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:40,229
analysis of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback and</font>

25
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:45,450
development of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process that is</font>

26
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:47,729
reliable predictable equitable to all

27
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,229
the parties and promotes the public

28
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:56,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">interest we think it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

29
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:58,140
enough to be put up on one slide and as

30
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,030
sort of a joke<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going to go through</font>

31
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whole process in about ten seconds</font>

32
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,909
in a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> words but I get fired by</font>

33
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:10,890
the interpreters and the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

34
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,290
staffs so what I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is take</font>

35
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,670
you through this process<font color="#E5E5E5"> step-by-step</font>

36
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:18,959
explain which each step of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

37
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,940
is and then paint<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fairly complete</font>

38
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,140
picture for you and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer</font>

39
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,130
questions and importantly take comments

40
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,839
certainly we haven't thought through it

41
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,630
you know we SAT around a table and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,360
consulted with people outside and

43
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:38,549
pondered all possible scenarios but I'm

44
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,900
sure our ponderings not done and so we

45
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:42,450
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear from you you know think</font>

46
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">about think about scenarios and how they</font>

47
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">would go through the process that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

48
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,780
be helpful for us and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for everyone</font>

49
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">here and thinking through the process so</font>

50
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,990
that

51
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:56,970
at the end of 30 days when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> finalize</font>

52
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,970
this that it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a complete form</font>

53
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,380
so what's the first step the first step

54
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:07,420
is the prioritization draw the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the and</font>

55
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,750
the basic new wrinkle to what we have

56
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,640
here it's a manual prioritization method

57
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,430
it's just a drawing so every application

58
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,829
number will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be assigned to draw a number</font>

59
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that draw number will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be used to</font>

60
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:23,550
assign priority during the life of the

61
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:29,700
application in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process the draw will</font>

62
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:31,930
occur in December there's some

63
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,750
jurisdictional requirements are about

64
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,250
conducting a draw so every applicant

65
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,880
every application is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to have to</font>

66
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:44,500
have a paper ticket you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> wave around</font>

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:46,480
it has to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> purchased in person and ft</font>

68
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,920
it has to be paid<font color="#E5E5E5"> for so we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> expecting</font>

69
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,920
the price to be about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred dollars</font>

70
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,470
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to place a burden on those</font>

71
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,269
outside the United States the draw is

72
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,180
going to occur inside the United States

73
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:03,760
it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it will probably occur in Los</font>

75
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,828
maybe somewhere else but those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

76
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:11,049
top two if travel is a burden<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

77
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:14,650
appoint a proxy a family member and

uncle<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in law that you don't like if</font>

79
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,899
it's difficult for you to appoint a

80
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,820
proxy I can will appoint one for you and

81
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,950
I can will absorb<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

82
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:28,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">appointment of that proxy so the process</font>

83
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:32,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">is intended to to result in no</font>

84
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:34,630
additional burden to applicants we would

85
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,880
to keep things simple and keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

86
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,919
process moving we created a simple rule

87
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,240
that draw numbers cannot be exchanged

88
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:44,650
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> between or among applicants or an</font>

89
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,650
applicant with himself on the same

90
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,780
applications it's not expected that

91
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,700
everyone will participate or that

92
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,250
everyone wants a high priority number

93
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,099
those that<font color="#CCCCCC"> opted out will be placed at</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end if there's multiple opt-outs</font>

95
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,919
they can be placed at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end and around</font>

96
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:09,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">them fashion so the draw will be</font>

97
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:11,258
conducted in December and then an

98
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,210
important note to how this process is

99
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:17,710
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work is how the objection</font>

100
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:20,770
process feeds into this and so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> can has</font>

101
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:23,460
published in the past that da but that

102
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:26,169
the objection period the period for<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

103
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,508
parties seeking to object can file their

104
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:31,299
formal objections well in January

105
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:33,460
thirteenth there's been some<font color="#E5E5E5"> ambaji</font>

106
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:38,530
there's a some amount of ambiguity about

107
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:40,120
that and some public discussion so in

108
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,679
the proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> it states that the</font>

109
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,289
objection period will end on March

110
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:50,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">thirteenth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is before any</font>

111
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:53,469
evaluation results will be posted but

112
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:56,669
right after that we'll start posting

113
00:05:53,470 --> 00:06:00,669
evaluation so along the end of march

114
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:03,000
north again<font color="#CCCCCC"> March 21st or march 24th the</font>

115
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:05,650
springtime in the northern hemisphere

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,080
initial evaluation results will be

117
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,940
posted and they'll be posted gradually

118
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,130
so remember we were going to post all

119
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,680
the results at the end of<font color="#CCCCCC"> June now we'll</font>

120
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,659
start posting results in April and still

121
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,849
end at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of June so if you do the</font>

122
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:20,770
math you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how many weeks are there</font>

123
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:22,960
in that period you'll see that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

124
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,870
planned that about a hundred and fifty

125
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,138
evaluation results get published per

126
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,139
week

127
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,750
now because we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to</font>

128
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:40,890
rejigger kind of the order of the

129
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:42,810
evaluations once the draw occurs we

130
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:47,930
expect that release rate to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind of</font>

131
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:52,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">slow at first and then ramped up an</font>

132
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:56,070
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> feature to promote Public</font>

133
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:59,040
Interest promote globalization better

134
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:02,780
enable those who can't use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

135
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,780
completely in their own language now

136
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,230
we've determined that IBN should go

137
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,520
first so that's part of the proposed

138
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:13,590
model so the ID ends will go into one

139
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,150
bucket of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draw have those numbers</font>

140
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,250
selected and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the remaining</font>

141
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,010
applications would go in the next bucket

142
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,720
there's a hundred sixteen<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think ID</font>

143
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">ends currently</font>

144
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,570
so applications that pass initial

145
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,520
evaluation and are free from objections

146
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,710
or contentions will progress immediately

147
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,109
into the next round what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the next</font>

148
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:42,460
step rather rounds or years from now

149
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:44,380
what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that means you pass</font>

150
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">the initial evaluation and you've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

151
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:50,140
more encumbrances is kind of a legal

152
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">term on this unit and using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but no other</font>

153
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,650
holdbacks to your application

154
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,230
progressing so if there's an objection

155
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:58,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">to your application of formal objection</font>

156
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:01,870
on one of the four grounds or if you're

157
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:04,300
in string contention with another string

158
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,340
or you've failed initial evaluation you

159
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:10,380
have to go on to extended evaluation

160
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,380
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> application will be held back</font>

161
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,520
and then while once that contention or

162
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:25,940
objection is resolved or your past

163
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:28,460
extended evaluation you'll proceed to

164
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,410
the next step and<font color="#CCCCCC"> join applications that</font>

165
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,530
are just passing you know initial

166
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:35,719
evaluation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> same week so you get</font>

167
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:41,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">back into the flow whenever your</font>

168
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:44,510
objection or contention clears so what

169
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:47,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that next step the next step is a</font>

170
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:50,689
determination of by the applicant of

171
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:53,989
whether that applicant wants to accept

172
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,430
the standard agreement so if you accept

173
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,810
the standard form agreement that's

174
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:01,670
posted in module 5 you go immediately on

175
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,400
to the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step and you'll have to wait</font>

176
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:07,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the next slide here with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is if</font>

177
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,939
you not do not accept the<font color="#CCCCCC"> base agreement</font>

178
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,500
you'll enter a negotiation<font color="#E5E5E5"> queue and the</font>

179
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:19,820
negotiation queue will be formed in the

180
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:21,430
priority order so while it's expected

181
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,220
that negotiation might take some<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

182
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:26,260
will will<font color="#E5E5E5"> there'll be multiple</font>

183
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:30,380
negotiations that occur simultaneously

184
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:32,439
how many instances of negotiation or how

185
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:36,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">much bandwidth do we apply to that</font>

186
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,810
depends a lot on how many applications

187
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,130
decide that negotiations<font color="#E5E5E5"> are necessary</font>

188
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,910
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that changes to the agreement are</font>

189
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:46,370
necessary we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working with different</font>

190
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:48,410
partners to provide a pretty high

191
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:51,280
bandwidth to conduct multiple

192
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,280
negotiations

193
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,390
and then once those negotiations are

194
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,740
completed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they go back up into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

195
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:07,980
mainstream so they go back on to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

196
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:11,760
next step I think it's no surprise<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

197
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,800
we've were encouraging applicants to

198
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,620
adopt the former agreement we've said

199
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,079
that you know at the start of this it

200
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,300
was not the start of this but in the

201
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,130
formulation of the guidebook that this

202
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,579
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a feature it's really really</font>

203
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:29,279
important to note that contracts will

204
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:31,500
not be executed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by I can at this stage</font>

205
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,570
so the applicant will be agreeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

206
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:38,279
form agreement or negotiate terms and a

207
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:42,260
new agreement and commit to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but we</font>

208
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:42,260
won't it we won't execute agreements yet

209
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,360
so once you've agreed to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> form</font>

210
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,860
agreement or completed agreement you can

211
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,420
go on to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next step which means you</font>

212
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,790
can make an appointment<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a pre</font>

213
00:10:53,420 --> 00:11:00,410
delegation testing so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

214
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:03,199
real metering right once you go to pre

215
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,329
delegation past you in priority order

216
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:07,219
you can make an appointment<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a pre</font>

217
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:09,800
delegation test there will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font>

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,860
appointment today so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> select when</font>

219
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,689
your number comes up you can select the

220
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,189
earliest available appointment or you

221
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:17,360
can select a later appointment if you

222
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:20,629
don't think here to be ready for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

223
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple months you pick pick pick a date</font>

224
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:24,589
a couple months so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is intended to</font>

225
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:27,139
let applicants pick the earliest

226
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:29,449
priority they can and want to but also

227
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:30,829
defer if they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of set</font>

228
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:33,679
a date for when they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start</font>

229
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:36,949
pre delegation testing and then getting

230
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:41,929
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the root zone so there'll be about</font>

231
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:44,748
20 or a few more appointments per week

232
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:48,920
about for a day and we'll give them

233
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:50,990
weekends<font color="#E5E5E5"> off or to do we work and this</font>

234
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,969
you do the arithmetic matches up pretty

235
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:56,389
well to a thousand a year so that that's

236
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:59,149
the spot at which these things are

237
00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:00,589
metered first and I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> applicants can</font>

238
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:04,429
make an appointment any time to suit

239
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:06,499
their own circumstances so if you miss

240
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:08,389
your if you miss your appointment or

241
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:11,209
failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> a test then you go back and make</font>

242
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:12,800
another appointment if you pass<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go</font>

243
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:14,809
on to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next step and I just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

244
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,059
say a few words about this so this kind

245
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:18,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">of have this work so say these are the</font>

246
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:21,439
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> strings and these are the</font>

247
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:23,809
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> draw numbers that get released</font>

248
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:26,809
into the pre delegation appointment

249
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:31,059
slots so say<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 through 4 which in this</font>

250
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:33,230
case are ex-ac and gee I don't know why

251
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:36,499
decide to take the earliest appointment

252
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,999
slots but string<font color="#E5E5E5"> F decides it's not</font>

253
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:39,980
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a couple weeks yet</font>

254
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:44,809
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be ready to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:48,019
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15th of april or whenever that is</font>

256
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:49,759
and so it decides<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take a slot in</font>

257
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:52,519
april and string<font color="#CCCCCC"> SS i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be</font>

258
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:55,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">ready for two weeks after that so these</font>

259
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,410
applications slots just fill fill up

260
00:12:55,129 --> 00:13:01,089
just like in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the spa down the hall</font>

261
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:04,310
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will never see the inside of and</font>

262
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:05,990
then how does this<font color="#CCCCCC"> a weekly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want</font>

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:08,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pause again how does this weekly</font>

264
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:11,389
release of results work well<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit say</font>

265
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,339
like at the same time every every week

266
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:18,500
like five o'clock on Friday night so

267
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:20,870
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go home and feel good in</font>

00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">Week one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will release the first set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

269
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,959
evaluation results so say we release 50

270
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,129
or 100 or 75 evaluation results in

271
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:31,069
priority order so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll be there'll be</font>

272
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:32,870
numbers one through 75 they'll go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

273
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:36,649
the contract selection phase so they can

elect in the next week to take the form

275

agreement or not so when week to that

276
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,779
one through 75 will make that selection

00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:40,510
ord so in the week where they have an

292
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:49,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">appointment if they pass we'll go ahead</font>

293
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:51,100
and execute contracts so note

294
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,840
importantly that we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">execute we plan not to execute</font>

agreements until after the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Beijing</font>

297
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:02,560
meeting this is to line up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

298
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:04,920
know about potential receipt of gac

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,920
advice

300
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:19,100
and similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pre delegation testing</font>

301
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,630
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to execute contracts at the</font>

302
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,910
rate of 20 a week so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a</font>

303
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:25,250
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> metering so they kind of pile up</font>

304
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,050
for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple weeks at contract signing</font>

305
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,450
then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a second metering and</font>

306
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:37,790
there'll be 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 20 contracts executed</font>

307
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:41,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">a week then they'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be forwarded on</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">tayana processing who's standard</font>

309
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:49,969
practice is to process<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications on a</font>

00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:52,850
first-come<font color="#E5E5E5"> first-served basis and I Anna</font>

311
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,980
and its delegation partners<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia and</font>

312
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,040
verisign are working on and will soon

313
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:01,600
publish a plan for doing that but

314
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,599
they've essentially worked through them

315
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:07,390
and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ayanna there might be some</font>

316
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:10,729
additional lumpiness in delegations

317
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:13,069
involved but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect the you know the</font>

318
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:17,510
delegations to be 80 85 a hundred a

319
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:20,089
month and and not exceed the thousand

320
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:26,060
TLD per year target not smooth

321
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:29,360
delegation rate so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially</font>

322
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,040
the the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> down in the lower</font>

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">left-hand corner I didn't talk about our</font>

324
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:40,790
guiding principles in this the idea is

325
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:44,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">to enable the program to move forward at</font>

326
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:45,860
a controlled pace but also<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a more</font>

327
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,360
rapid pace so there's some acceleration

328
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:51,800
here and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remark that if you</font>

329
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,470
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time frames in the guidebook</font>

330
00:16:51,800 --> 00:17:00,650
and back the original idea for batching

331
00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:02,900
of 500 we would have taken a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year and</font>

332
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:08,119
three quarters to nearly two years to

333
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:11,599
process all the applications and we're

334
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:14,169
remarkably a remarkably shorter time

335
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,169
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now</font>

336
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,839
we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> note again that the</font>

337
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:23,180
objection period will close nine months

338
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:28,399
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the publication date so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

339
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:31,370
March thirteenth will release<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID ends</font>

340
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,080
first to underline our commitment to the

global<font color="#CCCCCC"> public interest international</font>

342
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,220
outreach and like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability of</font>

343
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,520
those around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world to use their</font>

their computers in their own language

345
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:47,110
contract signing will occur and

346
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:47,110
delegation will occur after Beijing and

347
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,530
we're limiting delegations to<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

348
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:55,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">thousand a year to live up to our</font>

349
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:59,950
commitments that we made to the

00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">technical community and governments in</font>

351
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,810
to ensure the the safeguard and stable

stable operation of the domain name

353
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:16,850
system tada so that's it so I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the</font>

354
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:19,420
slide back up if I can can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get the</font>

slides back up

356
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:31,399
so if there are any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions please</font>

357
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:36,350
come to the microphone I'll get my pad

358
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:38,980
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> amadeo's first can you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

slides back up

360
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,190
you get them to put the slides back up

361
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,639
perfect thanks

362
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:09,279
so I'm a day or what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave out I was</font>

363
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:12,519
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to convey to you my reaction when</font>

364
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:15,039
I read this proposal about the draw I

365
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:18,549
remain a speechless with his remark the

366
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,929
remarkable state for me but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font>

367
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:22,929
to discuss about that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

368
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:24,999
unbreakable faith on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the faith that i</font>

370
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:29,829
very concrete problems I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> still lost</font>

371
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:33,969
about the constructional negotiations

372
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:36,668
two things three concrete things that

373
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:38,589
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be our according to the guidebook</font>

374
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:41,559
need to be negotiated with icon one is

375
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:43,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">very simple requesting an exception from</font>

for exclusive you still this correct is

378
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,599
the contract negotiation the time for

379
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:52,508
doing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and requesting the that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">does not accepting the best contract the</font>

383
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,969
second one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some provisions</font>

arbitration jurisdiction etc is also

these not accepting the base contract

388
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:12,549
that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the third one is the</font>

community-based till this that by

390

definition you to incorporate<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

commitments into the contract but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">letter is not accepting the best content</font>

393
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">right they accept the best concert but</font>

394
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,759
they want to add something because you

395
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:27,549
request that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this means in these</font>

396
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:29,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">three cases that you loop your your</font>

397
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:31,959
place in the queue because you have not

398
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,019
accepted the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bare-bones based contract</font>

399
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:38,320
or not so I we have to make that clear

400
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:40,209
you know we were we've spoke about the

401
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,599
community-based<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds and the</font>

402
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:47,349
restrictions around them and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

403
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,849
think but have to confirm that those

404
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:50,769
restrictions that are written into the

405
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:51,820
application can be put directly into the

406
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:54,729
agreement so that wouldn't be a

407
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:57,309
negotiation that's just standard with

408
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:59,259
regard to the other two things one most

409
00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:01,029
public authorities and the special

410
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:03,309
closest for public<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments so to</font>

411
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:05,529
speak right and the third one was the no

412
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:06,849
I got him right here I was I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it I</font>

413
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:09,249
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to say with regard to the</font>

414
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:11,109
other 2 i'm not sure so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to think</font>

415
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:13,569
we need to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that clear and you're so</font>

416
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:14,820
by your point really is on certain of

417
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:16,678
these contract amendment

418
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:20,309
they should be baked in without losing

419
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,480
our priority status yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yes and</font>

420
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:26,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know question regarding the</font>

421
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,899
interplay between objections and for

422
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:29,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance community priority because in</font>

423
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:30,689
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> case we have two different</font>

424
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">procedures for something that might be</font>

425
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,880
similar the same subject matter two

426
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:38,580
different procedures how display if an

427
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:42,000
objection against a community TV is

428
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:48,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tyler tomorrow the resolution starts now</font>

429
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,700
or only at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the objection</font>

430
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:53,428
period or only when the initial

431
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:57,509
evaluations are published right Amy I

432
00:21:53,429 --> 00:22:00,029
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so so the the objection</font>

433
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:02,009
period time table starts when the

434
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:04,259
objection is lodged so if you read the

435
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:05,700
objection processing I think there's 60

436
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:08,039
days for an answer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the</font>

437
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">timetables start so it doesn't wait</font>

438
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:11,879
until the animal forever<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

439
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:14,460
you'd want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spread those things out</font>

440
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:22,678
right so that makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense this is far to</font>

441
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:24,419
walk back and forth I I said okay I just

442
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,799
have a really simple clarification

443
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:28,649
question about contention sets an

444
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:33,600
initial evaluation so in the just

445
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:36,299
imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> 22 applications within the same</font>

446
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,730
contention set and when they when they

447
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:40,769
won and the draw gets the number one and

448
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:44,519
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second within the draw gets the</font>

449
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:46,169
number 100 does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that affect what order</font>

450
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:47,820
they'll be evaluated within the initial

451
00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:49,710
evaluation because they're in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kent</font>

452
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,980
same contention site and if so I think

453
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:55,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">it does right is it that the number 100</font>

454
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,289
gets drawn up to follow the one or is

455
00:22:55,409 --> 00:23:01,799
that that the one gets dragged back to

456
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:04,019
the 100 so it doesn't affect when they

457
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:07,799
get evaluated you get evaluated and

458
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:09,059
priority number so as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the draw</font>

459
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,950
is done we'll start feeding those

460
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:13,039
applications in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their reordered</font>

461
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:16,620
number but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens is under</font>

462
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:19,470
objections contention those applications

463
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:22,439
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> held there until the until the</font>

464
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:28,470
convent until the contention is resolved

465
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:30,750
and then right and so say number one

466
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:33,929
comes comes in the next week along with

467
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:35,520
applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200-300 that week it would</font>

468
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:38,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">be number one so it would be the first</font>

469
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,460
one to accept the standard agreement and

470
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:44,039
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> week's live</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I got hey</font>

471
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tina hey um so you just answered my</font>

472
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:49,440
question but i also have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tina</font>

473
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:54,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">damn about music about the ideas go</font>

474
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:56,070
first I think it's great to see um I can

475
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:58,650
doing something to promote the global

476
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:01,439
public interest and serve those

477
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:04,950
communities better but I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

478
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,390
got a quite just right because if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

479
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:09,600
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these ID and applications</font>

480
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:13,740
they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from those parts of the</font>

481
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:17,280
world so then you might say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well</font>

482
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:19,909
but ni DNT LD in some other language of

483
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,710
script might still serve that community

484
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:26,580
well but if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> do then look into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

485
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:28,700
of the registration rules they I don't

486
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,559
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they all do some of them have</font>

487
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,480
pre-registration rules for people that

488
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:36,780
already registered in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ascii version</font>

489
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,059
of that CLD and so are these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

490
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,889
couldn't get access to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet in</font>

491
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:42,899
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first place no I don't think they</font>

492
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:47,010
are these are people who pre-registered

493
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:49,530
to have a first-come gain which there's

494
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:51,750
nothing really wrong with but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

495
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:54,299
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not meeting your objectives so</font>

496
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,429
you may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at you know</font>

497
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:58,320
applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> from many countries</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

498
00:24:56,429 --> 00:25:01,470
if you're an applicant from Africa and

499
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,230
you picked you are TLD to be an ASCII

500
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:07,530
version you don't you don't you aren't

501
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,809
less you don't have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lesson</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right to be</font>

502
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:12,299
first in the queue then an idea until d

503
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:13,889
so so and there's other criteria right

504
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:16,320
so you could dig into the applications a

505
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:17,880
little bit and and sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like see to</font>

506
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,090
statistics on that before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make that</font>

507
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,679
call right and and you've been there so

508
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:25,860
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort of thing we</font>

509
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:28,559
all argued about when considering<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

510
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:30,479
and realizing that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of idn applique</font>

511
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,270
and applications are from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> united</font>

512
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">states or they're from big companies or</font>

513
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:37,950
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the applications from developing</font>

514
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:41,280
countries really have headquarters<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

515
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:42,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the US and it so then it becomes of</font>

516
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,760
choice a choice

517
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">so what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think is is the best and</font>

518
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,080
a bright-line rule and so that's why

519
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:50,850
what's written is written but that's why

520
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,280
it's posted for public comment to and

521
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,559
that where you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> others can suggest</font>

522
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,149
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of analysis that might provide</font>

523
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">the most benefit okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll try to make</font>

524
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:01,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the analysis for you with them online um</font>

525
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,450
but I'm not saying don't do the ideas

526
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:07,679
first I'm saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe add a little bit</font>

527
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:09,630
I understand hey Kurt Jim<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prendergast</font>

528
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">Galway Strategy Group I've got 47</font>

529
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:16,320
questions but all I asked to ok on the

530
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:18,120
IDN question if an ibn they're all

531
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,550
slated slotted first vote if an ID an

532
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,510
applicant wants to opt out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of going</font>

533
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:26,370
first would they just delay on the pre

534
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:28,410
delegation testing is that how they

535
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,850
would address that or if they live so

536
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">they wouldn't participate in the</font>

537
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:33,870
priority draw and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'd get what</font>

538
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:35,760
randomly<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end so ID and applicants</font>

539
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:37,649
have to participate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the random draw</font>

540
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,660
buy a ticket show up in LA even though

541
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:41,070
they're going first I think so but

542
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:44,040
that's a very good question and we

543
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:47,189
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then on</font>

544
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,870
gac advice there since there's a

545
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:51,360
conflict<font color="#E5E5E5"> between what the guidebook is</font>

546
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,699
saying and what is I think implied by

547
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,500
the chart the guide book says that<font color="#CCCCCC"> gak</font>

548
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,510
advice must be submitted before the

549
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,000
close of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public comment the</font>

550
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:02,730
objection period which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> now March</font>

551
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,740
thirteenth but we've already heard from

552
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the GAC that they hope to issue advice</font>

553
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,150
and I think we all hope they have issued

554
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,040
advice by the Beijing meeting so there's

555
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:12,480
a conflict there I asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to see I</font>

556
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,590
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got an answer but I'm</font>

557
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,440
sorry I didn't understand the question

558
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question is will you execute</font>

559
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,950
contracts before the receipt of gac

560
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:28,140
advice right so the receipt of<font color="#E5E5E5"> DAC</font>

561
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:29,520
advices is somewhat uncertain and so we

562
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:34,110
don't know exactly how that's going to

563
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:36,540
play out so in but for<font color="#CCCCCC"> in poor planning</font>

564
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:39,149
for that we've said know that we won't

565
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:42,059
sign any agreements before the Beijing

566
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:44,610
meeting we think that the gap position

567
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:48,540
about when<font color="#CCCCCC"> gac advice will be issued or</font>

568
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:52,320
how or if will solidify and then we can

569
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:55,090
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all certain so let's hope the</font>

570
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,370
get gets it done on time

571
00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:02,389
Marla hello Kurt this is annalisa roche

intent of the idea of equal multi

IDN going first and I support<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font>

579
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:32,960
is going first<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my comment is similar</font>

580
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:35,180
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tina's that since that's the that's</font>

581
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,870
the intent the and the strategy the

582
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:41,180
mechanism of how how that's done would

583
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:43,370
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> great if if that would looked at more</font>

584
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:46,910
in depth and I think if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

585
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:50,659
user is the customer of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can I believe</font>

586
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:53,030
I heard that this week maybe it's the

587
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:56,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet user that should be benefiting</font>

588
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:59,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">in terms of global access and if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

589
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:03,020
the case it may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the registry</font>

590
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:05,060
applicant<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is providing that global</font>

591
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:07,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">Public Interest Internet user</font>

592
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:11,080
accessibility that is the intent behind

593
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:15,290
that idea what what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that's really</font>

594
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:17,449
making a specific TLD accessible to that

595
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:19,790
Internet user and where's that public

596
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,650
interest actually going so like Tina

597
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,030
said there there's other parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

598
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:26,990
application that could be looked at and

599
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:29,680
then my my question is on this chart

600
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:34,190
here the third square over objections

601
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:36,110
contentions fail the yes and it goes to

602
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,880
the resolution box and I think we're

603
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:41,679
missing a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece there that is part</font>

604
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:45,230
of the I can process resolution i

605
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,910
believe is is either i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if i</font>

606
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,430
should use the word purchasing the TLD

607
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:52,160
from i can or going to and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can option</font>

608
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:53,750
but where is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how how does that</font>

609
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,090
look in terms of timeline and when we

610
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,590
would find out when and I can oxygen is

611
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,320
available to a particular string

612
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">contention set how long would that set</font>

613
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,310
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm assuming the set you have to</font>

614
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:07,130
wait until<font color="#E5E5E5"> all members of the contention</font>

615
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:10,659
set would pass evaluation so

616
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:14,210
when do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that next step right so</font>

617
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:16,190
so resolution means whatever reason

618
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:18,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever it is is the objections</font>

619
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:20,990
resolved or the conventions resolved or

620
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:23,450
the lack of passing the evaluations

621
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:26,210
resolved the way the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guidebook is</font>

622
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:27,740
setting out now is that well there's

623
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:30,470
ways of resolving contention right

624
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:32,480
there's community priority and there's

625
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,220
auction the way the guide book is

626
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,060
written is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community priority</font>

627
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:42,890
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds can elect the</font>

628
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:44,570
community priority test as<font color="#CCCCCC"> soon as all</font>

629
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:47,750
other contingencies are cleared so as

630
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:50,389
soon as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> E is over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for for that</font>

631
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:51,920
applicant and as soon if there's any

632
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,900
objections as soon as there's they're

633
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,840
cleared so they can raise their hand and

634
00:30:53,900 --> 00:31:00,200
say I'm ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> for community priority</font>

635
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:02,240
evaluation so similarly after that a

636
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,790
party can Sam we're ready for auction

637
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,000
were unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to resolve our differences</font>

638
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:10,909
the time during initial evaluation is

639
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,940
also the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time during which the parties</font>

640
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:18,680
are are expected to settle<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

641
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,440
differences or not and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then go to</font>

642
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,750
auction and then the auction can occur

643
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,730
either when all the parties<font color="#CCCCCC"> already say</font>

644
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:29,870
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to auction or when they're</font>

645
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:32,450
all done with ie<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I I just heard</font>

646
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:34,760
you this may be problematic<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just heard</font>

647
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:37,700
you say when all the parties are ready

648
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,410
to go to auction is that left up to the

649
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:42,380
parties to go to auction so let me let

650
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:44,510
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this way somebody has a hundred</font>

651
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">tlds and they're not in a big hurry to</font>

652
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:49,160
go to option does the single string

653
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:53,320
applicant have to wait until they feel

654
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:56,200
in the mood to go to auction

655
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,480
sorry Kurt I'm not in the mood I need

656
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,330
some clarity so I should have diagram i

657
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,519
sentence for you and so the parties can

658
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:06,039
go to auction soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> even when they're in</font>

659
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,769
evaluation if they all choose but then

660
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:10,690
once they're they're all out of initial

661
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:12,610
evaluation and objections are clearer

662
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:14,620
than a date will be set certain for the

663
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:16,719
auction so it won't set by I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

664
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:19,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we'll those auctions</font>

665
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,299
go on during your next slide showed the

666
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:24,549
week by week rollouts will there be

667
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:26,559
auctions along those week bye weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

668
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:28,570

669
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,039
will occur as soon as they can you know

685
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:11,620
question is if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decided</font>

00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:15,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">to whom the money goes and if not I</font>

good thanks very much<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's there</font>

692
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:29,320
are some restrictions around where that

693
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,509
money can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's conducted in</font>

move<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have very practical questions</font>

703
00:33:55,179 --> 00:34:02,470
around that like there are details of

704
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:05,049
the drawing process drama<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's minor</font>

705
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:07,139
details which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still not clear like</font>

706
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:10,290
my understanding is I

707
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:16,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">still have to participate the drawing</font>

708
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:18,850
yeah yes and then if we are sending our

709
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,490
representative for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the drawing uttering</font>

710
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:24,819
a restriction on who can be and who can

711
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:27,040
it be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that person and if we decide to</font>

712
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:29,200
use their<font color="#E5E5E5"> I cannibal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> important</font>

713
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,120

714
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,370
these hundred dollars in the pocket

715
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:36,520
because I mana<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stanek and that he has to</font>

716
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:38,739
pay in cash so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect these details</font>

to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> clarified I mean maybe in the</font>

718
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:46,060
nearest weeks and then audience mostly

719

00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:59,589
there might be necessary some

723
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:03,330
negotiations and some amendments to the

724
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:06,910
contract would I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider the way to</font>

725
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:09,009
make this negotiation squeak and end up

726
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:12,759
as quick as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible in order not to</font>

727
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:15,490
diminish that great move to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that idea SB</font>

728
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,550
first thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you that's an</font>

729
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:21,009
excellent point and you know contract

730
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:22,720
negotiations can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very brief or longer</font>

731
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:24,520
depending on what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> request of the</font>

732
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,040
registry is and if it's you know

733
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">straight forward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in some nuances because</font>

734
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,810
it's an ID n that can occur more quickly

735
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,330
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so and I certainly hear your</font>

736
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:37,390
question about furnishing more complete

737
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:38,860
detail more<font color="#E5E5E5"> pros about the requirements</font>

738
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:42,730
so you're certain about what you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

739
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:44,620
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok thank you thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you hello Fred</font>

740
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:47,500
Krueger minus machines two questions

741
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:50,140
first of all why does pre delegation

742
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:52,900
testing have to wait until initial

743
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,640
evaluation is complete why can't if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

744
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,130
systems are in place right now why<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

745
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,750
we actually begin pre delegation tests

746
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:01,030
can get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> over with it'll accelerate</font>

747
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,100
things it's my first question my second

748
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:05,470
question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in purely in terms of</font>

749
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:07,710
timing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've heard to date March</font>

750
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:13,720
thirteenth for the end of the objections

751
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:17,140
yesterday I heard the somebody said that

752
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:20,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">the initial results would happen in</font>

753
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:25,058
March and today I'm hearing April

754
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:30,969
so is it marks is an april what is it it

755
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:33,039
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> March so I misspoke myself so the end</font>

756
00:36:30,969 --> 00:36:35,259
of the objection period is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of</font>

757
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">March is March thirteenth and then</font>

758
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:39,609
initial evaluation results will start at

759
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:41,380
the end of March and if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

760
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:43,989
it that's what gives you enough weeks if

761
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:48,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do the math to get to about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a 150 a</font>

762
00:36:43,989 --> 00:36:51,759
week so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that I think two things</font>

763
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,229
one is pre delegation testing was set up

764
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:56,499
for those that have already passed the

765
00:36:53,229 --> 00:36:57,899
initial evaluation because you know it

766
00:36:56,499 --> 00:37:00,459
makes sense not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend money on</font>

767
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,729
applications or time or advanced

768
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:06,549
applications that have been passed

769
00:37:02,729 --> 00:37:10,509
testing yet second if we're living up to

770
00:37:06,549 --> 00:37:13,509
our agreement to start executing

771
00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:17,079
agreements and delegating<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds in the</font>

772
00:37:13,509 --> 00:37:18,999
right after Beijing there's real know by

773
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:21,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">int there's no there's no benefit to</font>

774
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:22,868
moving it forward any more than what it

775
00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:25,299
is right there<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of time how</font>

776
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:27,819
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many do we think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can pre</font>

777
00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:30,940
delegate a week but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do 20</font>

778
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:35,380
a week about 20 week thank you maybe a

779
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:37,719
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more higher order okay we</font>

780
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:40,359
understand from core and I have two

781
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:44,079
questions one of them is well if we're

782
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:46,959
asking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draw is not what I prefer</font>

783
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything everybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knows that drawer I'm</font>

784
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:51,430
sorry draw is not what I think is a good

785
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:52,630
idea but now that you have decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

786
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,430
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still hope you're going to</font>

787
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:57,880
change what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do with</font>

788
00:37:54,430 --> 00:38:00,710
those who you call the opt outs in which

789
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:04,430
order are they going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

790
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:09,200
put secondary drum<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm either going to</font>

791
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:12,200
play without playing so once somebody

792
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,339
opts out and attaches no<font color="#E5E5E5"> value to going</font>

793
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:18,080
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> second or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> third it's allowable to</font>

794
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:21,190
order them randomly because they've

795
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:24,020
already declared by opting out that or

796
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:26,240
that this has no value to them so that

797
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,859
what that's what makes you know this is

798
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">really poor me to be trying to explain</font>

799
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:31,580
this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should be explained in</font>

800
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,550
writing but that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes a random</font>

801
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:39,080
draw for those up outs allowable<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

802
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:40,760
now what is the justification for the

803
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,440
draw not to take into<font color="#E5E5E5"> account</font>

804
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,810
preferences there's some people who

805
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">would like to be going you know at this</font>

806
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,570
kid is given time maybe not now but

807
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,399
leave it later but they're not be able

808
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:52,640
to express that some of them

809
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:56,060
specifically single register interact

810
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,220
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> pie precisely exclusive you steal</font>

811
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:01,400
these those usually have only one

812
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:03,830
problem not to be the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> it not not</font>

813
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a hurry but they will not like the</font>

814
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:07,970
competitor to go two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead you</font>

815
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:10,270
know that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not good so basically</font>

816
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:13,430
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so long as they can express</font>

817
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:15,290
you know that wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know these are</font>

818
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:17,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">the competitors we do not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wish them to</font>

819
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:18,770
be ahead of us there were so long as

820
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:21,320
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're weak you can</font>

821
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:24,580
place if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't give them disability</font>

822
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:27,440
they have no other choice but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play</font>

823
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:30,589
they're not going to be opt-outs as you

824
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,420
call them because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they cannot accept</font>

825
00:39:30,589 --> 00:39:35,839
that risk you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know or increase that risk</font>

826
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:38,480
so what options are we giving them we're

827
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,520
giving them this option<font color="#E5E5E5"> which you know</font>

828
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">address is part of your concern but you</font>

829
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:45,650
know I you know it it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

830
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:47,810
to address all of it but in priority

831
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:50,599
priority order each applicant will be

832
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:52,790
allowed to select a pre delegation

833
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:55,250
appointment at a certain time so if who

834
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:57,830
wants to defer it if it sees the

835
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:59,810
prioritization<font color="#CCCCCC"> Xand sees all the strings</font>

836
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:02,690
and where they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> in prioritization it</font>

837
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:04,970
can pick a an appointment time that's

838
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:07,160
later on or earlier on and in order to

839
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:08,640
address you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in order to balance and</font>

840
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,799
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go soon but I see</font>

841
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,990
that guy's going now so so so I

842
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:15,720
balancing do I understand correctly they

843
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:17,700
have to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> and once they have a good</font>

844
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:22,399
number they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually graciously</font>

845
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:25,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">know select an appointment down the road</font>

846
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,390
yeah and and so we could discuss you

847
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,109
know what's the penalty for playing and

848
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:33,029
it's required by<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's required you know</font>

849
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:34,769
it's a jurisdictional requirement that

850
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:36,569
we charge a price for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so there's</font>

851
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:39,419
this hundred dollar ticket but

852
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:42,450
essentially that's the only that that

853
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,430
and administration is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only cost for</font>

854
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:46,859
playing and if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

855
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:48,960
different options we think this is the

856
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:50,880
the least burdensome to applicants and

857
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,680
most equitable and gives everybody the

858
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,869
same is actually not true that's

859
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,839
not the only cost the cost of playing is

860
00:40:54,869 --> 00:41:00,690
the randomness that is the cost so if

861
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:02,819
you could make sure in a better manage

862
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:05,039
system that you're in the right<font color="#CCCCCC"> spot not</font>

863
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:08,029
being disadvantaged the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one who's behind</font>

864
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:11,640

they have may be drawn number 1500 and

00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:20,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">FedEx hello ubs hsbc has drawn number</font>

867
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:22,410
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so basically that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means that</font>

868
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,700
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're a year or year and a</font>

half different if something goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong</font>

870
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,450
the process maybe is three years who

871
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:28,859
knows that is not acceptable they cannot

872
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:30,629
change that they can only<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope that</font>

873
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:34,109
their competitor would actually be

874
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:35,849
gracious enough to to also ate but we

875
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:38,609
did have the option to do it right so

876
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:40,109
why don't we do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right well so that's</font>

877
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:41,880
a balancing and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend that</font>

878
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:44,279
but that would that would require I can

879
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,319
you know applying judgment to which

880
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:48,420
which application should be grouped

881
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:51,150
together which death and some examples

882
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:54,450
is is easy yes it is it is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

883
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:57,150
choice if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask them they said so we</font>

884
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:58,890
did we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did as you said this there's no</font>

885
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:00,359
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no problem they between them</font>

886
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:02,308
they have no problems we just allowed to

887
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:03,779
express so rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than just sending a</font>

888
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:05,869
ticket if we could write something<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it</font>

889
00:42:03,779 --> 00:42:10,200
so to<font color="#CCCCCC"> speak you know please you don't</font>

890
00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:12,059
that's our preferred seat exactly as in

891
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,189
any other seating now the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

892
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:17,940
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this press with the objections I</font>

893
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:20,009
didn't understand what you said and the

894
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,760
written proposal in the written document

895
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:22,780
it says the objections will only

896
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,990
thought after the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the evaluation</font>

897
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:28,480
that when is it going to be so

898
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:29,709
objections can occur at any time yes but

899
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,200
when targeted are they going to be heard

900
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:34,720
and decide upon<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's looking at Wendy</font>

901
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:40,600
but I mean it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a me but the objections</font>

902
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:42,549
follow a timeline right right so there's

903
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,740
a 60-day window for replying and then

904
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:47,350
each objection takes off on<font color="#E5E5E5"> its own</font>

905
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:49,359
timeline okay okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> i meanshe if you just</font>

906
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:51,819
please have clarity on this is very

907
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:55,380
difficult or<font color="#CCCCCC"> stay where we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here's</font>

908
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,380
clarity coming right down the aisle

909
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:05,650
thanks Amy staff is from I can once all

910
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,140
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> objections are filed at that</font>

911
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:10,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">point I can will issue a dispute notice</font>

912
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,549
which will announce that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

913
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">objections have been filed in the</font>

914
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:17,320
objection period is closed at that point

915
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:19,600
in time the dispute notice triggers the

916
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:22,030
dispute resolution providers to then

917
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:24,670
send notice to all of the objectors and

918
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:28,330
the respondents that it's now time for

919
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:30,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">the respondents to file a response so</font>

920
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:34,000
all the time starts<font color="#E5E5E5"> ticking after that</font>

921
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:35,800
notices published so all those notices

922
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,370
will be published after the March

923
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,650
thirteenth day yes that's right well

924
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:44,049
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means that there's not going</font>

925
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:45,610
to be any case law in terms of ejections

926
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:47,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">old objections going to be heard at the</font>

927
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:49,030
same time all the respondents<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

928
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:52,390
prepare for all of them at the same time

929
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:55,150
and all the complainants have to make

930
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:56,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">objections against all you know the</font>

931
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:59,050
cases that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have so if you look at</font>

932
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:00,940
but well objections be posted when

933
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:04,210
they're objected to when there's an

934
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:06,580
objection filed it'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> posted so the</font>

935
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:08,410
applicants will see that or potential

936
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,810
objectors will see that an objection is

937
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:12,370
filed so they'll know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> as objection</font>

938
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:13,990
is filed and what and what's going on

939
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:16,540
here is another balancing right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

940
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:19,149
this allows us to consolidate the

941
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:22,990
objections and save the objector or end

942
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:25,120
or the applicant fees because all the

943
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,859
objections against one applicant can be

944
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,140
heard at<font color="#CCCCCC"> one time if it can be</font>

945
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,910
consolidated well the best consolidation

946
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:32,680
is an objection to go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and gets</font>

947
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:33,569
the thing done than the other ones will

948
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,720
never have to be done

949
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:38,940
so you can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but then somebody</font>

950
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,009
will object on different grounds or

951
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,870
people that are against a certain

952
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:45,630
application will wait wait for that

953
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:48,210
application objection to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolved and</font>

954
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:50,430
then and then and then file another

955
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:52,380
objection so there's there's kind of a

956
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:54,569
bad things that can happen it at either

957
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,730
stage well we have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to discuss more</font>

958
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:58,920
about the objections in this I mean

959
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:00,390
there's little<font color="#E5E5E5"> in yeah there's many</font>

960
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,860
things people and<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are enormous</font>

961
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:04,049
costs I mean if you're lucky community

962
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,340
objection the way I car call is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

963
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:08,910
be a hundred thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars at least</font>

964
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:11,190
for one and that's just heat that's not

965
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:17,940
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Bronner I gotta go on for that</font>

966
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:20,790
day thanks hey hi good answer get down a

967
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:23,700
bit here I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to rephrase a</font>

968
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:26,400
comment I made on Monday case it gets

969
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:28,169
lost in the shuffle where the applicant

970
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,350
for doubt that the Latin American

971
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:34,650
Federation of the internet and as I said

972
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:36,000
then I am still concerned about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

973
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:40,140
question of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draw I think it's a good</font>

974
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,450
idea but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way it's presented is as a</font>

975
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:45,480
single applicant there is a potential

976
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:47,279
that another applicant or other

977
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,380
applicants with tens or hundreds of

978
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,680
applications will go through the process

979
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:57,540
before I will with just one so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

980
00:45:52,680 --> 00:46:01,649
it might be that's a fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider</font>

981
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:05,520
having a first round in the draw per

982
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:07,230
applicant and not per application that

983
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:12,120
might seem to be a little affair thank

984
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:13,620
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks Tony Sarah falvey google</font>

985
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,529
I have a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually</font>

986
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:17,970
similar to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tina's and that is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

987
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:20,610
interesting things about the digital

988
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:22,859
archery process was that it provided for

989
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:24,930
global representation because it round

990
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:26,310
robin through the different regions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

991
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:27,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think we can all agree that there were</font>

992
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:30,299
clearly some issues with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> digital</font>

993
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:32,160
archery process itself and that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

994
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know generally an improvement on</font>

995
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,810
that process but it's interesting that

996
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:39,630
this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of round robbing round robbing</font>

997
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:41,220
through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> regions has been dropped and</font>

998
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,990
so I'm sort of interested as to why

999
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:46,020
that's taken place number one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1000
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:46,919
second point is what was the motivation

1001
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,319
around allow

1002
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,569
audience to go forth all on their own

1003
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:53,880
and not having it sort of bucketed and

1004
00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:56,190
you know alternating between<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ski and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1005
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:00,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">dion's and even if you did that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font>

1006
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:01,920
only extend their entry at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ID an</font>

1007
00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:04,950
entry into the route by you know roughly

1008
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">six weeks right so we start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a blank</font>

1009

criticisms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the digital archery model</font>

1011
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:15,299
were was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there was a great chance</font>

1012
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:18,119
that those that were closer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1013
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:21,119
place where ever that target was would

1014
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:22,680
have an advantage and so some some

1015
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,510
geographical locations would be

1016
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,509
disadvantaged naturally through the

1017
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:30,630
process so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of the round</font>

1018
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:34,260
robin was really meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to defeat that</font>

1019
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:35,730
and then and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then so starting with a</font>

1020
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,990
blank sheet of paper we you know we

1021
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:41,040
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how to serve the public</font>

00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,799
that there's commercial applications

1024
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,868
everywhere and not-for-profit

1025

1031
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:01,380
that's that was a choice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and your</font>

00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:08,069
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted to keep the model</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple but a recommendation along</font>

1036
00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:14,250
your lines can be thought through too

00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:55,369
be resourced we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need one choke</font>

1055
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,540
certainly we want to strongly and sent

1056
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:05,300
the adoption of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> form agreement and</font>

1057
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:07,490
that's what we're trying to do here but

1058
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:10,040
we are we are putting together resources

1059
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:13,848
to conduct conduct multiple parallel

1060
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:15,410
negotiations and you know we'll we'll

1061
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:20,420
firm that up when we see the number of

1062
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:23,629
the negotiations that occur hi Kurt

1063
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:25,520
alain prost<font color="#E5E5E5"> meds machines and something</font>

1064
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:28,640
very strange happened yesterday and I'm

1065
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:32,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">not referring to music night I found</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">myself agreeing with the GAC in that</font>

1067
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:41,000
gio's should have some priority behind

1068
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:43,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">idns for a couple of reasons it serves</font>

1069
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,609
the global<font color="#CCCCCC"> public interest it addresses</font>

1070
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:52,400
some of the questions about geographic

1071
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:54,230
diversity and we know hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> that geo</font>

1072
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,290
review panel will come out with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:49:54,230 --> 00:50:00,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">results well before initial evaluation</font>

1074
00:49:57,290 --> 00:50:03,500
results<font color="#CCCCCC"> are announced I what I thought</font>

1075
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:07,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the communities being in that</font>

1076
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:09,619
bucket as well but the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> the applicant</font>

1077
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:13,010
guide book is written we don't know if

1078
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:16,220
an application has passed they community

1079
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:19,460
evaluation panel until<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very end and</font>

1080
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:25,189
it's written so that that's not decided

1081
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:27,349
until it's absolutely the last thing so

1082
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:30,080
I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be concerned that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we would have</font>

1083
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:32,420
to rewrite some like applicant guidebook

1084
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:36,650
to include communities and some sort of

1085
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:43,369
prioritization<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple other points</font>

1086
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:45,080
I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are using the</font>

1087
00:50:43,369 --> 00:50:48,740
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> backend registry service provider</font>

1088
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:50,330
or if a single applicant has the same

1089
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:53,720
technology do they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through</font>

1090
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:55,700
the same pre delegation testing every

1091
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,450
for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> application or can it just be</font>

1092
00:50:55,700 --> 00:51:00,649
a check of a

1093
00:50:56,450 --> 00:51:02,569
particular system you have to go through

1094
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:04,280
it again and<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and again is that a</font>

1095
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:06,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">two-hour</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process as indicated in your</font>

1096
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:08,570
calendar is that a week long process I

1097
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:10,400
think it's I'm not sure I think it's

1098
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:12,589
much closer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first than the latter</font>

1099
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that will be good to know for</font>

1100
00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:16,279
resourcing yeah and will and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1101
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:20,930
publish an informational article about

1102
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:22,640
that okay another thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to</font>

1103
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:24,379
suggest and I think it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

1104
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:27,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea and unless there is a legal reason</font>

1105
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:29,690
not to I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it adopted since</font>

1106
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:32,540
our one hundred dollars will go to

1107
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:35,060
charity could we please<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick our own</font>

1108
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:38,599
charity for that to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I think</font>

1109
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:40,670
they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be less outcry from the</font>

1110
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:44,000
community if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the money goes to</font>

1111
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:46,640
the Sierra Club instead of United or

1112
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,400
something united way if i can say i want

1113
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,230
this hundred dollars to go here seems

1114
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:57,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">reasonable to me seems reasonable to me</font>

1115
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:58,609
all right good and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> overall</font>

1116
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:00,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think this is a really excellent</font>

1117
00:51:58,609 --> 00:52:02,779
solution i'm very glad to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see i can in</font>

1118
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:05,960
the board presenting something finally

1119
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:08,030
on this outstanding question and excited

1120
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:11,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">to start the ball rolling so thanks</font>

1121
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:13,760
terrific thanks Elaine and we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

1122
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:16,369
of the same discussions about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Geographic</font>

1123
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">Names and you know they're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1124
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:20,869
list like I said you can argue both

1125
00:52:18,589 --> 00:52:23,660
sides geographic names our names that

1126
00:52:20,869 --> 00:52:26,990
appear on a list right it's a not on an

1127
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:29,779
iso list or some other UN list there are

1128
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:32,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> geographic type names that purport</font>

1129
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:33,410
you know perform the same public

1130
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:34,700
interest or more of a public interest

1131
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:36,290
that aren't on those lists<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they</font>

1132
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,720
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be described as a geographic</font>

1133
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:40,730
names and and so that's that's what made

1134
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,200
the parsing kind of difficult but you

1135
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:45,170
know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> art there's arguments for</font>

1136
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:49,189
promoting other types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tlds hi how</font>

1137
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:52,460
could we miss Carrie Cooke<font color="#CCCCCC"> beyond I have</font>

1138
00:52:49,190 --> 00:53:00,230
bonus form of questions but<font color="#E5E5E5"> only those</font>

two one<font color="#CCCCCC"> I won only one I didn't see your</font>

1140
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:07,269
drawings the board's approval face

1141
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:11,679
because guidebook specified that

00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:17,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">ogod requires board approval so when is</font>

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's embedded in the process</font>

1145
00:53:19,059 --> 00:53:24,189
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board will receive reports on a</font>

that demonstrate that each application

1149
00:53:29,049 --> 00:53:34,749
as you know gone through the appropriate

1150
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:37,359
steps and all our published processes

1151
00:53:34,749 --> 00:53:39,339
have been met and the board can decide

1152
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:43,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">if it wants to investigate at any time</font>

1153
00:53:39,339 --> 00:53:45,369
any application so the board will

1154
00:53:43,149 --> 00:53:48,009
provide oversight and be involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1155
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:50,640
process but will not there will not be a

1156
00:53:48,009 --> 00:53:54,609
specific board step where each TLD is

1157
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:58,390
approved<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the board okay just a</font>

concurrent applicant with more than one

1159
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:06,098
is true but still down is really support

1160
00:54:02,649 --> 00:54:09,130
the idea of having multiple drawings for

1161
00:54:06,099 --> 00:54:12,249
a scene first drawing for senior

1162
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:14,259
applicants and then missing and the one

1163
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:16,658
application of an advocate and then

1164
00:54:14,259 --> 00:54:21,130
another draw for the second application

1165
00:54:16,659 --> 00:54:23,049
and so forth so there could be a really

1166
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:29,459
more balanced<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way of putting each</font>

of these thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amedeo here I am so I</font>

1168

direct so jealous<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know part of you</font>

convey the same Tildy for the two

<font color="#E5E5E5">Wales just having them one year apart</font>

1223
00:56:30,479 --> 00:56:35,430
they are applying for two after a long

00:56:32,759 --> 00:56:38,219
political and social debate why I can

1225
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:40,950
endow draw should you really recognize

1226
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:42,599
that useless debate they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one</font>

1227
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:44,910
method of saying we want them together

1228
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:47,609
it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurt me doesn't harm anybody</font>

1229
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:49,200
else so in the same for the case that

1230
00:56:47,609 --> 00:56:51,180
burden were saying about competitors

1231
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,308
just tell them you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in that</font>

1232
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:55,019
track we are in that group so you draw

1233
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:56,640
for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> route</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and where we are the</font>

1235
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:01,589
but allow us to minimize what we

1236
00:56:59,759 --> 00:57:03,479
consider perhaps wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> way but we</font>

1237
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:05,969
consider us applicants that would be

1238
00:57:03,479 --> 00:57:08,460
harmful to us so I think there's some

1239
00:57:05,969 --> 00:57:11,069
room for in not just improving the

1240
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:13,979
system but limiting the collateral

1241
00:57:11,069 --> 00:57:16,619
damages of applying a blind absolute

1242
00:57:13,979 --> 00:57:17,640
rule on the draw and I don't know what

1243
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:19,739
it is possible or not that's the

1244
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:21,299
question and and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we you know</font>

1245
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:22,799

others have talked about it alive yet

1247
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:27,239
you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of you know putting</font>

1248
00:57:25,049 --> 00:57:30,540
competitors together some competitors

1249
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:34,110
might not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be put together so</font>

1250
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:36,060
I different and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we some</font>

1251
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:38,130
applicants might not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be forced</font>

00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:53,940

tickets to be exchangeable because it

1276
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:35,220
would seem that that might be a valuable

1277
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,810
thing that someone who draws a high

1278

number that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really care when</font>

00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:10,800
it so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've talked a lot about</font>

1292
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:12,930
applicant for a single TLD versus one

1293
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:15,090
for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred and the one for a hundred</font>

1294
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:17,310
can you know see the lay of the land<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1295
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:19,770
gain advantages against the single

1296
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:22,620
single applicant 1 by rejiggering his

1297
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:24,900
his<font color="#E5E5E5"> priority so if he sees a competitor</font>

1298
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:26,580
over there he can get in front of it by

1299
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:29,640
virtue<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1300
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:32,390
applications and then there's some you

1301
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:34,830
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that just an energy TLD process</font>

1302
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:36,900
there's there's there's there's

1303
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:39,290
criticism even though this is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:41,180
creating<font color="#CCCCCC"> value through</font>

creating businesses that make profit

1306
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:46,490
there is there is criticism of the

1307
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:48,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">process by allowing businesses to sort</font>

of what could be termed manipulate the

1309

overall look of the program but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:01,430
get me out to the bar i'll get on the

1314

comments in that portion sure thank you

1321
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:23,990
comment the first one is is about it the

1322
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:26,570
one hundred dollar price for the ticket

1323
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:29,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">is it a minimum requirement for</font>

jurisdiction<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a random</font>

1326
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:37,480
number that you come up with and the

1327
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:40,850
second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can arrange</font>

1328
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:45,020
proxy be<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can staff or and independent</font>

1329
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:47,779
proxy you be contracted because that

1330
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:50,420
question is for applicants or

1331
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:53,120
applications that they don't bother or

1332
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:56,450
they couldn't cannot afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to us</font>

1333
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:59,450
withdraw and they will all depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1334
01:00:56,450 --> 01:01:02,540
this proxy and so we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

1335
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:05,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">more detail about how you will assume</font>

1336
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:09,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the proxy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will do his or her job</font>

1337
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:12,260
properly and the different one which is

1338
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:16,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">a tell men that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that will support the</font>

01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:19,430
idea of heaven first one draw for single

<font color="#E5E5E5">applicants okay thank you very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much the</font>

1341
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:25,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">one hundred dollar price is not random</font>

1342
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:26,900
but it's not it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a hard line price</font>

1343
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:30,170
written into the jurisdictional

1344
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:33,980
requirements it it has to be of some

1345
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:37,640
value you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and balancing that fee vs</font>

1346
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:39,380
that evaluation fee and<font color="#CCCCCC"> other costs we</font>

1347
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:41,600
determined<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one hundred dollars was</font>

1348
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:43,160
the right number for that so not random

1349
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:45,529
you know selected to meet the

1350
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:47,089
jurisdictional requirements on the proxy

1351
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:49,040
will be an<font color="#CCCCCC"> independent third party and</font>

1352
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:50,270
we will publish more information about

1353
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,220
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you arrange for that</font>

1354
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:56,720
and I understand your comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

1355
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:59,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">single applicant thank you could Cal hi</font>

1356
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:03,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">another remote participation question</font>

1357
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:06,320
this one is from<font color="#CCCCCC"> SH weta the retox</font>

1358
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:08,720
registry questions so the applicant with

1359
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:10,760
the draw number 120 is in contention

1360
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:14,899
with an applicant for the draw number

1361
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:17,180
800 the former applicant has to wait

1362
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:19,910
until IE results for the latter is

1363
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:22,399
published weeks later does it make sense

1364
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:25,040
make more sense to group all

1365
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,650
applications in contention into one set

1366
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:31,730
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ie results that is published I</font>

1367
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:33,980
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 800 along with 120 that way</font>

1368
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:37,660
both could potentially move into

1369
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:40,100
contention resolution process right and

1370
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:41,899
another excellent question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1371
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:43,370
the way it was in the old batching

1372
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:47,990
scheme when we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do batches of</font>

1373
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:49,730
500 recognizing that contention can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1374
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:51,709
resolved<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the parties can</font>

1375
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:53,930
get together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and resolve it you know I</font>

1376
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:56,210
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead of initial evaluation</font>

1377
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:59,419
results or<font color="#E5E5E5"> between that time you know we</font>

1378
01:02:56,210 --> 01:03:00,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">made the election that you know you can</font>

1379
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:04,790
you can accept the standard agreement

1380
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:06,890
once we know you're a viable candidate

1381
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:09,110
from the standpoint of passing ie and

1382
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:12,650
resolving contention so it's really the

1383
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:15,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the gate to agreeing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to agreeing to a</font>

1384
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:18,650
form of agreement great thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> Catherine</font>

1385
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:22,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">high</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> current this is annalisa with the</font>

1386
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:24,800
dot green community I support the the

1387
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:28,069
draw I like the randomness of the draw

1388
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:30,890
and and what you had spoken about

1389
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:34,340
earlier where people who have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1390
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:38,359
draw cards don't gain an advantage by

1391
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:43,280
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to manipulate the order and I</font>

1392
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:46,160
had a comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> about auction actually had</font>

1393
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:48,260
two comments you you just mentioned

1394
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:51,049
about that resolution time that is

1395
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:54,890
offered<font color="#E5E5E5"> to applicants but I think</font>

1396
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:58,640
there's a there's a silent dangerous

1397
01:03:54,890 --> 01:04:01,420
assumption behind that idea and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1398
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:03,368
that all applicants are in it for the

1399
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:07,820
same purpose

1400
01:04:03,369 --> 01:04:09,800
ie money so if this was a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1401
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:13,040
everybody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it for the money then</font>

1402
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:17,090
it's you know it sort of makes sense

1403
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:19,550
great they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> work things out but the</font>

1404
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:21,560
reason behind that for each applicant

1405
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:23,990
could be different<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think i think</font>

1406
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:26,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">that shouldn't be an assumption on the</font>

1407
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:28,839
on the part of the planning and then

1408
01:04:26,359 --> 01:04:30,940
moving on to I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I can talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Shin</font>

1409
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:33,850
are we going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear this week about</font>

1410
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:35,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">what happens to the money I know</font>

1411
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:38,299
previously there was some talk that I

1412
01:04:35,869 --> 01:04:40,970
can I can auction money would go to

1413
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:42,410
charity has that<font color="#CCCCCC"> been confirmed are we</font>

1414
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:44,359
going to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

1415
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:47,420
here so going backwards you'll hear some

1416
01:04:44,359 --> 01:04:50,600
more about that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't intends</font>

1417
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:51,830
to establish a foundation part of it

1418
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,630
goes to how much money there's going to

1419
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:55,970
be so you don't want to spend a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1420
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:58,940
money creating a foundation that it

1421
01:04:55,970 --> 01:05:01,160
manages a fund of money that's

1422
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:03,440
non-existent or really small and and

1423
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,819
vice versa so it's sort of a chicken<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1424
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,710
egg thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll publish more so</font>

1425
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:08,750
there there's thousands of foundations

1426
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:13,010
existing it would that be a possibility

1427
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:15,800
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can as a 501c3 can they donate</font>

1428
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:19,250
to an existing foundation maybe we could

1429
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:21,980
it's kind of miss california tax loss by

1430
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:24,230
my scope yeah and I by the way the dark

well here's 185 thousand dollars so

1434
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:36,170
let's cut off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lines here because</font>

we're kind of at a<font color="#CCCCCC"> time hello Kurt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:45,950
question that day before yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1438
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:50,780
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> d accepts enough standard</font>

1439
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:52,759
agreement is on on mojo file but they

1440
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:57,200
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another related question</font>

1441
01:05:52,760 --> 01:06:03,680
that exhibit a which defines its

1442
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:07,910
registry service on module file is blank

1443
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:11,618
it's why pay so my understanding is all

1444
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:14,810
registry has to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> something on that</font>

1445
01:06:11,619 --> 01:06:18,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">exhibit a so</font>

1446
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:22,049
this means that every registry has to

1447
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:26,790
have a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of negotiation between I can</font>

1448
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:30,180
so that the my question is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept</font>

1449
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:35,720
standard agreement a definition of what

1450
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:40,410
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this except steps and agreement so</font>

1451
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:43,589
without<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yes question is what is the</font>

1452
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:45,598
definition now as accepting standard

1453
01:06:43,589 --> 01:06:48,299
equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks thank you that's a</font>

1454
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:51,329
very good question now I can give you a

1455
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:52,680
partial answer that in one of the

1456
01:06:51,329 --> 01:06:55,740
questions you answered in the guidebook

1457
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:57,868
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trent can tell me which one it is as</font>

1458
01:06:55,740 --> 01:07:00,629
you describe your registry services and

1459
01:06:57,869 --> 01:07:02,490
in fact part of the evaluation is to

1460
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:04,890
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure your registry services don't</font>

1461
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:07,169
disturb the enesta bility those are the

1462
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:09,690
registry services that would be

1463
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:11,220
incorporated into the agreement so if

1464
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:13,740
you wanted to introduce additional

1465
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:16,470
services that were not part of your

1466
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:19,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">application they would have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

1467
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:22,439
through that<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS stability review which</font>

1468
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:25,500
would kind of retard the the processing

1469
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,030
of the application but and I don't know

1470
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:30,900
and you know I'll talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> John and</font>

1471
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:32,819
others about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wording in the in</font>

1472
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:35,280
the and the answer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that question can</font>

1473
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:37,440
be taken verbatim or what has to be done

1474
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:40,470
to them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to make that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a contract</font>

1475
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:42,060
term rather than rather than an answer

1476
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:44,368
to a question but essentially the

1477
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:46,078
intention is whatever you answer to that

1478
01:07:44,369 --> 01:07:47,760
question about registry services goes

1479
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:49,859
into the agreement becomes part of it

1480
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:55,079
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the negotiation is if you want</font>

1481
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:58,940
to depart from that that makes sense yes

1482
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:58,940
they were at this moment thing okay

1483
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:04,290
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi it's me again Elaine pros-</font>

1484
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:07,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">machines I'm just a couple quick</font>

1485
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:09,900
questions is the drawing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-hour</font>

1486
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,990
event or a week-long event or somebody

1487
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:14,819
can pop in at their convenience what's

1488
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:17,040
the date range of the auction if you

1489
01:08:14,819 --> 01:08:19,560
trigger the start of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> auction how the</font>

1490
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:21,420
date range of the auction you trigger

1491
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:24,930
the auction how long does that last and

1492
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:26,609
then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a suggestion I've</font>

1493
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:27,989
heard lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1494
01:08:26,609 --> 01:08:31,639
they can't accept the standard agreement

1495
01:08:27,988 --> 01:08:34,858
because it's contrary to their

1496
01:08:31,639 --> 01:08:37,799
jurisdictional laws such as the EU só a

1497
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:40,770
suggestion to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can legal staff to put</font>

1498
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:44,790
together standard contracts<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will</font>

1499
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:47,130
address those problems before we get to

1500
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:49,290
April thanks so the auction<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be a</font>

1501
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:51,540
day-long event if I was Fadi I do this

1502
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:54,000
great job of saying you know bring in

1503
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:56,339

1506
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:04,170

1507
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:06,358
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting and now we can</font>

1508
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:08,130
make it sort of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a public</font>

1509
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:10,139
interest event around the benefits<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

1510
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:12,690
we're expecting to get from new gTLDs so

1511
01:09:10,139 --> 01:09:15,449
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect to get some benefit out of it</font>

1512
01:09:12,689 --> 01:09:18,028
too but anyway one day and then I

1513
01:09:15,448 --> 01:09:19,408
understood your other<font color="#CCCCCC"> comments yeah so</font>

1514
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:22,259
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> auction if you read the guide book</font>

1515
01:09:19,408 --> 01:09:25,318
and i know you have really provides a

1516
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:28,738
wide range of dates that where the

1517
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:31,080
auction could occur because you know

1518
01:09:28,738 --> 01:09:33,689
different types of contention or

1519
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:35,609
objection have to clear before the

1520
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:37,858
auction occurs or attending it can occur

1521
01:09:35,609 --> 01:09:39,810
you know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> soon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> party's complete</font>

1522
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:42,989
initial evaluation so auctions could

1523
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:44,310
occur right after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the initial evaluation</font>

1524
01:09:42,988 --> 01:09:48,839
results for the contending about

1525
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:51,089
applications are released or well well

1526
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:52,979
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can take that kind of time</font>

1527
01:09:51,089 --> 01:09:54,780
frame in the guidebook and slide it you

1528
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:56,879
know once once an auction starts how

1529
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:58,739
long does it last that's pretty well

1530
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,000
defined in the guidebook to I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think do</font>

remember options yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a the whole</font>

1533
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:10,739
auction takes place in a day or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two days</font>

1534
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:12,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay Carol hi one more remote</font>

1535
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:15,000
participation actually we have quite a

1536
01:10:12,389 --> 01:10:20,670
few and these will have to answer after

1537
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:22,889
the session and mr. Kumar since the pre

1538
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:25,230
delegation testing metering also follows

1539
01:10:22,889 --> 01:10:29,070
the draw order an application which has

1540
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:30,900
number 800<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in contention with results</font>

1541
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:33,780
in a multi-million<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollar auction</font>

1542
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:36,179
results will lose interest in the

1543
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:38,699
auction capital for many weeks can the

1544
01:10:36,179 --> 01:10:40,380
auction in such a<font color="#CCCCCC"> case happen closer to</font>

1545
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:45,360
the contract selection<font color="#E5E5E5"> slab</font>

1546
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:50,400
pre delegation date if a train leaves

1547
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:53,460
new york and 3 p.m. on a tuesday<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an</font>

1549
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:58,199
get all the better so since pre

1550
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:01,259
delegation testing also<font color="#CCCCCC"> follows the draw</font>

1551
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:04,980
order an application which has draw

1552
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:06,570
number 800 and is in contention which

1553
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:09,809
results in a multi-million<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollar</font>

1554
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:13,110
auction result will lose interest on the

1555
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:15,780
auction capital for many weeks can the

1556
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:18,360
auction in such a case happen closer to

1557
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:22,769
the contract selection versus the pre

1558
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:26,549
delegation day so yeah you know the

1559
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:29,280
auction can occur as as as soon as the

1560
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:32,070
parties elect but after the<font color="#CCCCCC"> parties</font>

1561
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:33,509
clear initial evaluation and objection

1562
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:36,420
and contention will that will want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1563
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:42,420
attach a time certain to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font>

1564
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:46,409
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> no supposed to say hi Jordan hi Kurt</font>

1565
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:48,540
I'm Jordan Buchanan with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google so a</font>

1566
01:11:46,409 --> 01:11:50,580
very quick question and then maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1567
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:54,449
slightly longer comment the very quick

1568
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:56,489
question is is the 20 slots for pre

1569
01:11:54,449 --> 01:11:58,230
delegation testing per week is that a

1570
01:11:56,489 --> 01:11:59,759
technical limitation you guys don't have

1571
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:01,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the capacity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do more testing than that</font>

1572
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,030
or is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> not an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arbitrary thing to</font>

1573
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:04,860
roughly match how much you expect to

1574
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:07,679
delegate into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route later neither of</font>

1575
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:11,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">those or choices well what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the source</font>

1576
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:13,020
of a 24-week limit on a pre delegation

1577
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:15,420
testing my pad it kind of matches up

1578
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:17,280
with a thousand a year right so it's

1579
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:22,380
it's to match the delegation rate

1580
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:25,290
essentially all right uh so<font color="#CCCCCC"> my comment</font>

1581
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:28,770
is that I just wanted to basically thank

1582
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:30,090
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that the this proposal</font>

1583
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:34,260
don't think is perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll make some</font>

1584
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:36,810
comments but I think it's a you guys

1585
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:38,730
clearly read all the comments from folks

1586
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:41,880
you listen to the community I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font>

1587
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:43,559
proposal is significantly superior to

1588
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:45,840
almost any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the public comments you</font>

1589
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:48,719
receive so you were able to assemble a

1590
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,280
bunch of not great ideas and take

1591
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:52,720
elements of them and incorporate<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1592
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:54,550
into a reasonably good idea

1593
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,960
and in addition to that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font>

1594
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:58,120
session this is this is probably the

1595
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:00,040
best session I've ever attended at an

1596
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,840
icann meeting I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of</font>

1597
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:04,000
engagement from staff the honesty and in

1598
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,740
the productive exchange with you Curt in

1599
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,210
the session and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again the quality the</font>

1600
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:12,480
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the community i think is</font>

1601
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:12,480
a big knock let's do more of this please

1602

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't follow that so have a good</font>
