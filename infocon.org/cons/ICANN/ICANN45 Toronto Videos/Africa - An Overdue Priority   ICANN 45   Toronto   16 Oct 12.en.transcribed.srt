to miss this opportunity and we are

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">determined to at least guide awake to</font>

some favorable conclusion and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outputs probably shows that</font>

93
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:33,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the strategy will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be presented later</font>

94

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this was an</font>

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,910
opportunity we could not miss so in

96
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:42,510
spite of a tight program that we had we

97
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:45,630
decided to employ bottom-up open and

98
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:48,270
public processes in spite of the short

99
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,909
time because was so relevant that we

100
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,969
engage the community in the process so

101
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:56,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">living went as far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a public website</font>

102
00:04:52,970 --> 00:05:00,330
trophy to receive comments regarding the

103
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:03,540
strategy now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that we have the</font>

104
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:07,409
beginnings of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> strategy for Africa one</font>

105
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,950
that icons presence in Africa we can

106
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,780
improve and one that we believe that

107
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:15,870
African parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> Beijing icon will also be</font>

108
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,859
improved of course there was the best

109
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:22,170
effort so there is more that we can do

110
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,360
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to point out that the first</font>

111
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">step we did was to seek input from the</font>

112
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,130
community by we have questionnaire

113
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,229
before we even started anything and then

114
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:34,230
when we felt that we had narrowed down

115
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:37,890
some thoughts we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight back to</font>

116
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:40,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the community to get input and that's</font>

117
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,690
led to that today's forum and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

118
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,760
get more input as a result<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that so</font>

119
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:48,390
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing our very best efforts to</font>

120
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:51,240
reach out to the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> community to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

121
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:53,340
support for the strategies and help us

122
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,610
determine the actual elements that will

123
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,739
go forward from from this point on

124
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:01,580
we also expanded a group as we went

125
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:04,159
along to act<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-food originals regional</font>

126
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,008
representation<font color="#E5E5E5"> constituency's and we</font>

127
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:10,120
will have reasons to some consensus as

128
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:13,039
we went along now I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only</font>

129
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,960
important element is the African ization

130
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,719
which is then related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,318
internationalisation that you're very

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:15,318
this effort so with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

148
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:17,378
welcome you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give us on the max thank</font>

149
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,379

150
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:29,810

151
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:34,100
today but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just quickly to say that this</font>

152
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:37,160
indeed<font color="#E5E5E5"> this effort started very much on</font>

153
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,940
a whim I we had not planned it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

154
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,370
was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so obvious that it was needed</font>

155
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:48,169
when we met in Prague I felt the sense

156
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:50,389
of frustration at our inability to come

157
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:54,469
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> move the agenda of Africa</font>

158
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:55,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ford we needed to do that and I'm just</font>

159
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:59,090
delighted today I mean I'm sitting here

160
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:02,620
and there is a working group that was

161
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:05,388
formed that worked that produced and

162
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:09,110
extended every expectation we all had

163
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:12,470
they will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> Annie is very humble in</font>

164
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,270
saying we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

165
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,430
see their work and I had the privilege

166
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:20,389
of looking at it this is pretty

167
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:22,490
impressive work and moreover<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's more</font>

168
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,740
impressive because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> built as me</font>

169
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,979
said with multi stakeholder involvement

170
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,440
across the board when Patrick went to

171
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:33,679
Africa I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> him please work with me to</font>

172
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,890
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone is involved this has</font>

174
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:42,919
we grab the opportunity to do something

175
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,650
together and we do it now he's right

176
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:49,130
that it's the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> because a plan</font>

177
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:51,199
on paper is just a plan on paper and you

178

00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,900
apologize the reason why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> peeked ahead</font>

289
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:54,560
is it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been overbooked and</font>

290
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,910
been made to run back and forth various

291
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,280
people have noted that today's my

292
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:02,180
birthday and I think the birthday

293
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,470
present is to see if I consider the

294
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,979
birthday<font color="#CCCCCC"> President to see if I can</font>

295
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">survive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a stamina test and which is</font>

296
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:12,670
which is why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I absolutely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to get</font>

297
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:15,530
a cup of coffee in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to move forward</font>

298
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:18,500
I've got an<font color="#CCCCCC"> appointment in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the and the</font>

299
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:25,310
other side of the complex in eight

300
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:27,890
minutes so I'm absolutely fascinated and

301
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,140
that sounds in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> peculiar way but I my</font>

302
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,240
attention is focused on what the

303
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:35,029
substance of the program is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on the</font>

304
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:41,690
success of it and whatever the resources

305
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:43,200
are needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make things succeed we on</font>

306
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">the board our</font>

307
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,420
one hundred percent behind this and as

308
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:51,689
you've heard this is not just me

309
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,670
speaking as chairman of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board we</font>

310
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:57,360
have individual board members who are

311
00:15:53,670 --> 00:16:00,240
deeply involved committed and trying to

312
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,740
make best use of all resources and it's

313
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,780
not a forced effort these are

314
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:08,870
commitments that come from very

315
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:12,720
naturally out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our deep interest in</font>

316
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:18,080
and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will we will be back visiting</font>

317
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:20,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">in Africa together and individually and</font>

318
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:24,900
cheering and paying very close attention

319
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:27,030
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> commend all of you on the effort</font>

320
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">that has been put in and on the success</font>

321
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:35,600
that you already have in a really

322
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:38,610
stunning Lee Kum concrete and complete

323
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,230
set of material which and just sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

324
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,780
impolitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> grabbed from my own said a</font>

325
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,820
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me look through all of this</font>

326
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:48,980
so it's quite impressive so with that

327
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:51,990
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to stand back and share</font>

328
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:55,950
and and just before I leave with Steve I

329
00:16:51,990 --> 00:17:00,000
would like to say one thing what

330
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:04,860
propelled us to action in Prague was the

331
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,680
sense that Africa is behind now with

332
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:10,079
what you delivered I think Africa is in

333
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,839
the lead and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you've done</font>

334
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the plan you put will be a model for</font>

335
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:18,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">other regions and you should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be proud of</font>

336
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:22,079
that and then good afternoon to

337
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:24,780
everybody ampere than genome and spoke a

338
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:28,198
person for this Africa strategy or

339
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:32,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group what I'm going to try to</font>

345
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:58,158
documents are posted on our website and

346
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:01,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group members</font>

347

with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of them are are you</font>

348
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:08,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">neo-soul briefly explain how we actually</font>

349
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:12,240
assemble the group we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to</font>

350
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:15,449
deliver you know this outline in three

351
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,940
months time and we needed people that

352
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:21,179
mostly kind of volunteers and then

353
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,639
donate their time actually sent I'm

354
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:27,299
happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this group really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

355
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:35,939
was committed especially during our

356
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:38,460
retreat in now in a malicious so right

357
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:42,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">away I'm not going also to dwell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

358
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:44,429
details or not how we<font color="#CCCCCC"> manage to really</font>

359
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:47,190
do the work but one interesting thing

360
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:50,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I notice is that we sent out few</font>

361
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:54,120
questionnaire the idea was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually</font>

362
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:58,019
kind of see what are the expectations

363
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:02,219
there on the ground so from the

364
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:04,919
questionnaire received we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> some SWOT</font>

365
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:08,399
analysis and was quite interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us</font>

366
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:11,549
who see that whatever civil society

367
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:14,219
private sector a kind of government you

368
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:16,110
know the expedition were quite different

369
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:20,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually so we end up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

370
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:23,158
different snow sports but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> manage also</font>

371
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:25,559
to kind of find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> know kind of synergy</font>

372
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:29,909
in all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we have this</font>

373
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:31,799
sort of recommendation that the one

374
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:35,909
interesting thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everybody will</font>

375
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:39,779
say that well Africa needed a kind of

376
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:42,029
special treatment for different reasons

377
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:46,799
actually of course the industry is not

378
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:47,620
there the last round of new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld also</font>

379
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,930
proved that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

380
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,729
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> some job to be done in Africa to</font>

381
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,320
actually communicate these people so

382
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,270
that they also see that there is

383
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:59,860
certainly some business to do in this

384
00:19:55,270 --> 00:20:02,980
field so yeah Africa should be a special

385
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:05,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">place the other thing that we noticed</font>

386
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:09,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were saying that well icon</font>

387
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:11,920
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that known when Africa and also</font>

388
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:13,389
in terms of participation Oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> African was</font>

389
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,780
thinking that well they are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

390
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:18,670
participating in terms of you know

391
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:22,030
efficiency and whatever they could bring

392
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:25,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know to the table as well and there</font>

393
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,879
a suggestion you know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ideas and</font>

394
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:33,580
I think that we should actually work on

395
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:35,200
so that we better the situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> Swatton</font>

396
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:40,120
and that's what are available actually

397
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:42,730
and on the website and you can also go

398
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:46,500
for them but the key word here is that

399
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:51,550
is what really informed our thinking

400
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:54,910
there it written in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Boris</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also help us</font>

401
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:57,070
we produce facts about Africa of course

402
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:59,910
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have time to really get on that</font>

403
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:03,159
for the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we did have on Africa</font>

404
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:05,590
the statistic are quite there and the

405
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:09,429
quite comprehensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOC really sure that</font>

406
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:12,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're in fact Africa is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a land of</font>

407
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:17,380
opportunity actually that so many things

408
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:20,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know are there to be done Miriam</font>

409
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:23,320
cables<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> laid down this</font>

410
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:26,559
is second now in the word in the tempo

411
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,840
fino consuming the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GSM and then we also</font>

412
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,970
know that the Nets Africa million of

413
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:35,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">African we'll get into that internet you</font>

414
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:37,750
know through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lesabre phone so there</font>

415
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:42,580
is something to be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> there so we were</font>

416
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:45,880
quite clear about that one so what was

417
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:48,210
our approach I think the approach was to

418
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:51,390
align our self in<font color="#CCCCCC"> part with the four</font>

419
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:54,970
focus area of icons that is itself

420
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:58,990
especially deserted for 2012 and 2015

421
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:00,070
and also to actually emphasize the

422
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:04,420
internationalization

423
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:06,939
of icon and see how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> African</font>

424
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:10,720
stakeholder who fit in that in terms of

425
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:13,870
no engagement and to foster global

426
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:21,160
partnership and also the industry in

427
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:23,739
Africa now I pass all the detail because

428
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,810
what's going to matter is also the type

429
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:30,130
of interactivity we are going to have to

430
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:33,399
question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> right given you know this</font>

431
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:38,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to sort of prerequisite that I mention</font>

432
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:41,560
we end up you know highlighting a few

433
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,720
strategic objectives that what plan for

434
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:47,139
Africa or slightly plan for a few casual

435
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:50,470
should have and this is what I'm trying

436
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:54,340
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spur to you here I'm not going to</font>

437
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:55,840
list all of them but you see some of

438
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:59,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">them have been highlighted in green</font>

439
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,510
color and then that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font>

440
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:07,630
know aspect as to achieve you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

441
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:11,129
soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as possible also this strategy</font>

442
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:14,050
objectives like I said follow the four

443
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:16,390
focus area of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> icon strategy itself</font>

444
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:19,990
well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be in mind that actually</font>

445
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:22,030
we also added a fifth dimension<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

446
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,650
which is kind of what we might call the

447
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:25,780
development into a metal you know a

448
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:28,450
dimension of the whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when you</font>

449
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,570
read through<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this sort of the row</font>

450
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:35,830
mental perspective is going to be

451
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:38,439
already the slides so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I would</font>

452
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:42,899
just do now is maybe briefly point out

453
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,710
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the strategy objectives to you</font>

454
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Connaughton</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when it comes to the</font>

455
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,420
instability and security one of the

456
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:52,210
strategy of death that most people think

457
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:55,330
that we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be having is to enhance</font>

458
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:57,390
cooperation with search for better

459
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,189
handling of the NSS related incident

460
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:03,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously there was the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of notice a</font>

461
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:05,560
security issue that we need to tackle

462
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:07,420
especially in Africa so we believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

463
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,060
setting up you know search you know in

464
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,919
different countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> in region the best</font>

465
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,350
way of the

466
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,299
this when it comes to competition or

467
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,949
consumer trust and consumer choice for

468
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:18,509
instance one other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

469
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:21,480
suggesting is to build business

470
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:25,320
environment that favor customer trust

471
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:27,779
and choice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes through</font>

472
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,029
technology solution you know legal and

473
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:33,869
recognition framework you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in</font>

474
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:35,549
place now for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IANA cooperation for</font>

475
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:37,949
instance we believe that visualization

476
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:44,129
of iono operation in Africa should also

477
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:48,419
be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> best you know into to retain now to</font>

478
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:49,889
the healthy governance ecosystem we

479
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:51,450
believe that we certainly need to

480
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:55,678
continue promoting the multi-stakeholder

481
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:57,480
model and platform in Africa government

482
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,629
civil society and private sector level

483
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:05,970
to enrich participation in African in

icon consistencies outreach program that

485
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:10,859
will create you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know more</font>

486
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:12,720
internationalization and also most

487
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:15,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in see that we should ensure a</font>

488
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:20,389
physical presence in Africa to conduct

489
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:22,590
average to reflect icons global image

490
00:25:20,389 --> 00:25:25,320
like I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through</font>

491
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:27,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of them but definitely we can go</font>

494
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:40,919
one or two and then move forward in

495
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:45,570
terms of the competition consumer to us

496
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:47,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">and consumer choice again people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font>

497
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:50,189
have you know African entrepreneurship

between global and local entrepreneur in

the DNS industry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a healthy</font>

502
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:05,220

503
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,919
ongoing commitment of icon and

504
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,779
consistency to act in Africa's public

505
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:14,399
interest and this is kept on coming you

506
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:17,519
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> public interest of course the those</font>

507
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:19,469
strategic objectives you know have then

508
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,620
been translated into

509
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:24,480
a few sort of project and projects and

510
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:30,840
that would inform the action<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan for</font>

511
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:36,299
the three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ended up to come so now</font>

512
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:38,820
going to the satirical project they they

513
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:42,510
also we have plenty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them but I'm</font>

514
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:44,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">going also to highlight a few them one</font>

515
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:47,190
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> project is about setting up</font>

516
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:49,889
business development incubators for the

517
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:53,190
DNS business in Africa so you'll be

518
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:55,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">hearing this coming you know business</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

519
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,580
Africa<font color="#E5E5E5"> business we go we really believe</font>

520
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,429
that this is something which is missing

521
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:05,070
here and healthy governance ecosystem

522
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:07,140
suggesting are like an Academy to help

523
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,510
in capacity building and human resource

524
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:13,340
development in Africa<font color="#E5E5E5"> which what that</font>

525
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:17,520
was quite a very strong you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

526
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:19,470
suggestion of people especially on the

527
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,020
only comment because we did receive you

528
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:26,820
know different comments and contribution

529
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:29,789
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community to those different</font>

530
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:31,260
project we also assign what I will show

531
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:35,850
we went through some sort of key

532
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:38,158
measures key measures for lessons in

533
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:42,360
Africa would be for<font color="#CCCCCC"> S&T</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> domain name</font>

534
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:44,400
indicators if you want to set up the

535
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,139
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of industry in Africa you didn't</font>

536
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:51,150
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know exactly what's happening</font>

537
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:54,059
there something like a domain name

538
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:56,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">Observatory for instance is quite needed</font>

539
00:27:54,059 --> 00:28:02,460
their security indicators for instance

540
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:04,740
from Africa a foundation for DNS you

541
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:07,200
know industry in Africa but<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are</font>

542
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,880
you know good idea dive in so how do you

543
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,309
measure those things well it's by

544
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:18,480
setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you know the things the</font>

545
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:20,428
indicators and then a move ahead one key

546
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,720
measure also be an African sort of

547
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:28,320
leader<font color="#E5E5E5"> war so a number of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

548
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,580
give number startup<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies are being</font>

549
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,710
in the incubators

550
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:36,230
the increased copy of the root server<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

551
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:39,680
would have a few possibly can also do

552
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:43,190
more and they got a happy governess

553
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:45,650
ecosystem visibility of i can at Africa

554
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,630
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a communication in French and the</font>

555
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,090
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in CC that it has to be also</font>

556
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:53,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">in different other languages such as you</font>

557
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:58,790
know French and I think we cater for

558
00:28:53,210 --> 00:29:02,270
that well then what what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

559
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:05,360
suggesting if you go for all of these in

560
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:07,310
terms of critical list that could go

561
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,689
into what Michael the first year of

562
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,790
operation because in our term of

563
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,980
reference we're supposed to actually

564
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:15,050
splits you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever activities</font>

565
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:17,180
right there in two different years only

566
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:20,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">three years time through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first one</font>

567
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:24,470
those first critical list<font color="#E5E5E5"> those we are</font>

568
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:26,450
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> here set up a program for</font>

569
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:29,420
impressing cooperation with our internet

570
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:34,000
will call the meetin a star in Africa is

571
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:37,370
we call them in fact every stars meaning

572
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">afrinic a frog whatever the organization</font>

573
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:43,219
in a GF so kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> build sort of enhance</font>

574
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,960
cooperation with them we want to promote

575
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:47,960
regional events for multi stakeholder

576
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,450
engagement which necessary especially in

577
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,940
Africa where<font color="#CCCCCC"> government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> civil society</font>

578
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:57,020
and business components are not very

579
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:59,060
playing you know together we would like

580
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:01,340

600
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:06,690

<font color="#E5E5E5">this a joint work is to be done jointly</font>

by Africans and I can for our to

603
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,970
implementation definitely we do

604
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:19,110
recognize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> while icon is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

it to partner with others<font color="#CCCCCC"> to develop</font>

607
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:27,929
icons constituent you know industries we

608
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:31,139
also believe that while Africa can

609
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:36,450
benefit from support it must invest in

610
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:38,220
its businesses and partner and most of

611
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:40,830
you certainly will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading in on the</font>

612
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:46,220
press if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is any part of the world</font>

613
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:49,020
where the GDP is supposed to be growing

614
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:51,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is Africa which means that something</font>

615
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,908
needs to be done so that's why we say

616
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,860
it's a land of opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what is</font>

617
00:31:53,909 --> 00:32:01,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">that really needs to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be actually helped</font>

618
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:04,678
and then briefly well what am I

619
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,360
concluding remarks on this and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

620
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:10,230
the side that we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> did I would</font>

621
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,610
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was quite timely to actually</font>

622
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:15,510
think of designing you know such a

623
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:17,399
strategy for Africa as we said<font color="#E5E5E5"> Africa</font>

624
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:19,590
deserve special attention to be fully

625
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:23,908
integrated in the internet business and

626
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:26,039
industry we also believe that icon in so

627
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:28,380
doing will be assisting in transforming

628
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:33,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gillian capacity into real development</font>

629
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:34,710
in opportunities in fact we also learn

630
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:37,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">how to better engage with the community</font>

631
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:39,630
when we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know three month ago</font>

632
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:42,000
where community wanted most of them

633
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,500
wanted to spend time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in knowing who is</font>

634
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working group while</font>

635
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,470
we were thinking that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we needed to</font>

636
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:48,940
deliver so how do you engage you know

637
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:51,850
with the community is quite is quite

638
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:54,159
important we also believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

639
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:57,490
session from part of icons regular

640
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,460
delivery and our principal

641
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:02,770
recommendation I think one of the first

642
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,799
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the principal one is the we</font>

643
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:08,139
recommend<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this draft outline of the</font>

644
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:10,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">strategic plan should be favored and</font>

645
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:13,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn into a fully-fledged strategy of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">course after necessary consultation are</font>

647
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,428
conducted within<font color="#CCCCCC"> African</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> community and</font>

648
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:21,250
icon constituencies we also recommend

649
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:23,049
that we should integrate the this sort

650
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:26,169
of activity into the icon annual

651
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:27,700
corporate planning process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we</font>

652
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:30,159
build that we should reform the

653
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:32,200
membership of the Africa started working

654
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:36,039
group to be better align with icon

655
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:39,970
consistency and s 0 SE organizations

656
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:41,650
these are our recommendations and really

657
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:44,350
like to thank you for attention and

658
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:47,890
stand ready for more question thank you

659
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:49,480
very much but the most important thing

660
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:51,940
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be taken away from</font>

661
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is that it's integrated into the</font>

662
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:59,039
iqf strategic plan it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a special</font>

667
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:18,480
strategic plan when you look at the

668
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:22,929
documents you will see that there is the

669
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">ICANN strategic objective but then if</font>

670
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:26,409
you keep on looking you'll see that

671
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:29,199
inside that I can't achieve your

672
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:31,000
objective there are now strategic

673
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,428
objectives for Africa<font color="#E5E5E5"> that relate</font>

674
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,319
directly to that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a</font>

675
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:40,869
little bit broader view and and say that

676
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:44,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">to me this meeting is is symbolic of</font>

677
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:46,779
something and and it's evidence of a

678
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:50,019
real shift to transition in I can and

679
00:34:46,779 --> 00:34:51,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's view of the world one of the</font>

680
00:34:50,018 --> 00:34:52,719
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's affected I can in the</font>

681
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,428
past is that we tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more</font>

682
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,730
inward-looking than perhaps we should

683
00:34:54,429 --> 00:35:01,359
have been and and this meeting the the

684
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:03,220
initiative by by you as a group and I

685
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,490
cans willingness to support it indicates

686
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:09,339
that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking more outwardly and I</font>

687
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:11,169
think it's much to the good and I'd like

688
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:13,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">to focus on the word community to</font>

689
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:16,269
illustrate this we often talk about the

690
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,890
i kin community let's put this to the

691
00:35:16,269 --> 00:35:20,109
community how does the community feel

692
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:22,990
about this it's the community's job to

693
00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:24,788
develop something etc etc and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

694
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:27,910
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very slippery word but</font>

695
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:30,609
it's indicative of how we view I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can in</font>

696
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:33,009
the I can process I can identify seven I

697
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:35,319
can communities and you can think of

698
00:35:33,009 --> 00:35:37,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">them potentially as a set of concentric</font>

699
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:40,210
circles of increasing radius and

700
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:41,470
including more people there are the

701
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:44,140
people who always line up at the

702
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:45,609
microphone and comment on the web that's

703
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:49,210
a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> small community when we know</font>

704
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:51,069
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> who they are then there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the VA</font>

finally there are all users of the DNS

that the important thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

726
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:44,500
particular activity illustrates is that

727
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:46,270
we are expanding our sense of community

728
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,400
to including most of the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

729
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:51,670
world and that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the community</font>

730
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:54,010
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can is increasingly unaware that</font>

731
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,510
it's the real long run community of<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

732
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:57,910
can and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to pay</font>

733
00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:00,040
significant attention to it thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

740
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:22,780
step in better days coming not just for

741
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:27,460
the african community but our community

742
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:30,130
I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> proud when fatty was presenting</font>

743
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:34,319
this idea of having a special strategy

744
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:37,270
for the African region and I remember

745
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:40,060
the eyes his eyes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know he was so</font>

746
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:42,339
passionate and really truly believing

747
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:47,410
every word that we were hearing during

748
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:51,279
the last hour Africa now it's going to

749
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:54,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">be living I can in so many regards so</font>

750
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,440
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a first step let's use it in a</font>

751
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:00,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">really positive way and I'm sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">will thank you merci beaucoup thank you</font>

753
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:07,328
very much we are in an area where we

754
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:09,640
speak several languages and we have

755
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:10,210
interpreters so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to speak in</font>

756
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:17,170
French

757
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:23,440

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:32,560
is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like when I Frollo started to</font>

opened you led the way you opened doors

764
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:51,460
for icons to work at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> regional level</font>

765
00:38:46,869 --> 00:39:01,510
before going to the worldwide level the

766
00:38:51,460 --> 00:39:04,330
global<font color="#CCCCCC"> level so what you did the other</font>

767
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:07,980
regions will have to do it as well maybe

768
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:11,440
we have those five strategic plans and

769
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:13,839
with five strategic plans maybe we be

770
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,060
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have one strategic plan for I</font>

can thanks to you thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

775
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:32,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">comment on what's being presented so far</font>

776
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:35,410
and having followed me onto the borders

777
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:38,800
an African<font color="#E5E5E5"> representative it's even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

778
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:41,049
of a pleasure what I can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I think</font>

779
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,570
the approach that you've taken is so

780
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:45,849
spot on what we don't need is a special

781
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:49,270
plan for Africa Africa is special in so

782
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:50,740
many respects but what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

783
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:54,150
we're following the key objectives of

784
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:57,430
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> can if we need special treatment</font>

785
00:39:54,150 --> 00:40:00,040
then we'll do it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> special way</font>

786
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:02,379
what we're doing yet is following the

787
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,210
key focus areas of our cannon looking at

788
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:07,210
specific projects and specific

789
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:10,660
implementation where as Africans we can

790
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:13,420
add more but also we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> put up our</font>

791
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:15,509
hands and say include us in some of

792
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:18,310
these areas because for various reasons

793
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:20,950
historical and otherwise lack of skills

794
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:23,570
lack of infrastructure

795
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:26,450
to some extent the the lack of

796
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:28,700
interaction with the technologies we've

797
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:31,700
fallen a little bit behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's come up</font>

798
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:33,799
to speed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as the first time we're</font>

799
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,450
saying let's actually bypass that and

800
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,730
there are other<font color="#E5E5E5"> regions you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font>

801
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:41,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">from that to say well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's put this</font>

802
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:44,030
focus so I'm incredibly positive because

803
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:46,250
this truly looks like an African

804
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:50,120
strategy for I can rather than an icon

805
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:54,680
strategy for Africa<font color="#E5E5E5"> how does Africa best</font>

806
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:57,650
leverage the expertise<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network the</font>

807
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,480
facilities that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can offers in order to</font>

808
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:02,320
expand its growth and then in return

809
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:04,990
Africa will be giving back to I can and

810
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,740
this to me is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right model and</font>

811
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:09,729
congratulations for this team for

812
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:12,279
spotting it for putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> it together and</font>

813
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:15,290
the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm most excited about</font>

814
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:17,510
there's been a little bit of muttering

815
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:19,820
within some portions of our community

816
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:21,200
that the committee wasn't inclusive

817
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,270
enough that it wasn't big enough it

818
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,839
wasn't small enough i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even sure</font>

819
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:28,730
where the criticism came but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm really</font>

820
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:32,420
positive to hear that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is seen as a</font>

821
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:34,610
work in progress this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer larger</font>

822
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:38,630
more inclusive project and what this

823
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:40,370
committee is done is set the path and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

824
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,010
was inviting other people to walk along

825
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:45,799
to contribute to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take over to take some</font>

826
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:48,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the burden off your shoulders and to</font>

827
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,460
actually advances so those people who

828
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:51,560
are still passionate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and feel they've</font>

829
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:56,210
been left out well they're invited to to

830
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:58,040
come in and join the CEO made a slight

831
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:00,110
factual error when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> refer to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact</font>

832
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:03,440
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he met with all of the African</font>

00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:06,650
participants in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prague fortunately the</font>

834
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> room wasn't that full or nearly as</font>

835
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:11,060
full as this room is to suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

836
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:14,359
had all of the African participants

837
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:17,840
there but it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> pleasing to me to</font>

838
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:19,910
see a room this<font color="#E5E5E5"> full largely primarily</font>

839
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,250
with African participants in to see how

840
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:24,109
many of as they are over here to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the</font>

00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:26,690
other people who really interested which

842
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:28,280
is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> fantastic but I'm hoping that</font>

843
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:31,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that we can grow on as</font>

844
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,990
well is that together as Africans we

845
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:35,850
together once in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an arcane meeting to</font>

846
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:38,910
move the sport<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what progress</font>

whether it's a working<font color="#CCCCCC"> group or specific</font>

what progress has been made reporting

back internally so we can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the</font>

rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the community so well done to</font>

while this effort was going on in the

summer I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was doing a lot of other</font>

859
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:18,180
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a comment about that</font>

860
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:25,080
related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Africa as well but when I</font>

came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this room too I had did not know</font>

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expect i thought i'm going to</font>

863
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:35,600
hear and see few slides was few generic

864
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:38,970
things and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was blown off by seeing an</font>

865
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:41,520
integrated approach to the icon overall

866
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:44,220
strategy I don't know who thought about

867
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,220
that how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> came about to do this but</font>

868
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:48,720
that's genius in my view and as

869
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,669
everybody said it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would have been</font>

870
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,118
totally wrong to have a separate

871
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:56,940
strategy for Africa so the fact that you

872
00:43:54,119 --> 00:44:00,210
guys got it I think are absolutely one

873
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:03,330
hundred percent right you have

874
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:05,580
my congratulation and my admiration and

875
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:09,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> admiration to everybody who worked</font>

876
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:12,420
on the strategy now I want to turn to

877
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:15,270
new gTLDs because this is important in

878
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:17,339
terms of outreach as you know there's

879
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:20,250
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a second round we don't know</font>

880
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:22,349
exactly when this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be and one</font>

881
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:24,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing probably didn't do very well in</font>

882
00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:28,410
the first round was an outreach and

883
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:30,960
awareness into Africa and and getting

884
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:33,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">this program really deep into Africa and</font>

885
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,790
I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can integrate that as</font>

886
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:39,180
part of the strategy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next round</font>

887
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:41,820
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we specifically focus on the</font>

888
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,890
outreach and education and we will see

889
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,589
in the next round far more applications

890
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:49,290
coming from Africa making it to the top

891
00:44:46,589 --> 00:44:52,490
level so once again congratulation to

892
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:55,320
all of you and superb<font color="#CCCCCC"> job well done I</font>

893
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:57,990
think we'll like not like to take a few

894
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:01,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">comments from other members</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of other</font>

895
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:05,069
panelists<font color="#CCCCCC"> police' good afternoon</font>

896
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:06,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody I just like to say that I'm</font>

897
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:09,030
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel privileged to have being</font>

898
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:11,910
part of the team<font color="#E5E5E5"> that worked on the</font>

899
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:13,800
strategy and also to say that this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

900
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:16,470
passionate group that wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

901
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,690
Africa being pushed forward to excite

902
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:21,270
Libya to ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave a level playing</font>

903
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:23,520
field with other countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also to</font>

904
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:25,440
say for me you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an issue</font>

905
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,520
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> government's participation within</font>

906
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,839
the i kin community or within the gag<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

907
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,880
think now we have a document<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

908
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:34,560
can actually take to our governments and

909
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,740
say that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we now have a strategy</font>

910
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,540
for Africa and I think that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you</font>

911
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:41,580
know a motivation enough for them to

912
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:44,369
actually start participating within I

913
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:46,140
can and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that you know as</font>

914
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:48,060
Africa<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very important also</font>

915
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:50,790
to take the issue of research<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

916
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,710
development to heart and also capacity

917
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:55,650
building and skills development because

918
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:57,900
for us to actually you know be part of

921
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we are the places that you look to</font>

922
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,700
NH

923
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:08,410
that we have the capacity and the

924
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:11,950
capabilities to actually do that thank

925
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:13,600
you I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the opportunity to not</font>

926
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:15,910
to rehash what everything have already

927
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:18,130
said because we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to thank</font>

928
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:20,799
ourselves for what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're doing since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

929
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:24,580
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in that I can process</font>

930
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:26,980
I see myself as self appointed

931
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:30,040
ambassador for my continent I do not ask

932
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:32,890
anybody to appoint me<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that and when</font>

933
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:36,700
it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be part of any initiative</font>

934
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:38,710
that loud our voice as African I would

935
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,660
not ask people to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to join and I</font>

936
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:45,190
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's a common sharing feeling</font>

937
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:48,000
I i see here many people who for over 15

938
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:49,990
years they are just<font color="#CCCCCC"> dividing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their self</font>

939
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,300
themselves and their energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and time</font>

940
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:54,939
just to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> our continent in our</font>

941
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:58,360
country more visible so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

942
00:46:54,940 --> 00:47:00,160
opportunity for both I can and us an

943
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:03,010
opportunity for<font color="#E5E5E5"> action because it's an</font>

944
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,920
organization we trust we believe in it

945
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:08,620
we join it and we deliver a lot of our

946
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,570
energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and our hope that what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

947
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,670
doing will be for the benefit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

948
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:15,280
whole community and it's also an

949
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:17,680
opportunity for us because everybody is

950
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,990
asking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> more participation and</font>

951
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,990
involvement from Africa and this is

952
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:25,270
truly an opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us to say this</font>

953
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:27,669
is our concern can we have our own

954
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:29,890
agenda because we don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow</font>

955
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:32,470
other people necessarily on their own

956
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:34,540
agenda we get our own issue and we need

957
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:36,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take care of this and its really a</font>

958
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:40,540
matching between two feelings to need

959
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:43,240
and to opportunity and I think that it's

960
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:46,690
the right timing nothing was perfect and

961
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:49,299
I just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be very humble we lost in</font>

962
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:51,490
the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> very many contributors who</font>

963
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:54,730
think to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> something in it but it's</font>

964
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:57,939
not it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a unique way of doing this</font>

965
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:59,890
it's an open path we we go pass to the

966
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:02,560
line so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

967
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:04,359
behind as we have stated and many others

968
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:07,029
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this is</font>

969
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:09,520
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a start up so let's join and make</font>

970
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:11,560
it in a very positively manner nothing

971
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:15,040
was perfect but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will improve it thank</font>

972
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,799
you very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really like to be a</font>

00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:26,150
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to recall that we start</font>

975
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:30,350
this communication between icon and

976
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:34,490
Africa really in Dhaka meeting where we

977
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:38,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">organize a high-level meeting with all</font>

the ministry in charge of ICT in Africa

979
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:48,560
and we produce<font color="#E5E5E5"> African agenda for icon</font>

980
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:53,630
and we had the discussion with the board

981
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:58,190
and i really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to keep the secret</font>

982
00:48:53,630 --> 00:49:04,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">these opportunity to thank Steve Crocker</font>

983
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:09,470

that being an inter-governmental ization

1156
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:36,400
that the strategy plan is not just about

1157
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:40,390
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can can do for africa is also</font>

1160
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:51,730
consideration and starting by putting

1161
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:56,609
more energy in one on what we can do to

1177
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:54,450
Shanghai own many Africans have been

1178
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:57,460
taking part that program<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will suggest</font>

1179
00:59:54,450 --> 01:00:02,919
they do the working group to see how

1180
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:05,020
they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use those person who have been</font>

1181
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:08,890
trained and then because when you

1182
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:12,780
understand very well<font color="#CCCCCC"> was an entity is</font>

1183
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:16,120
doing you can efficiently contribute

1184
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:20,680
sorry I'm basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> french-speaking so</font>

1185
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:22,630
that to be open I prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I have</font>

1186
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:25,569
preferred to explain myself in English

1187
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:29,800
so thank you for many many years there

1188
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:32,080
has been a tremendous silence when we

1189
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,220
come to things like the open forum when

1190
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,779
we come to when we come to the i Ken

1191
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,919
meetings generally when there's a real

1192
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:39,400
lack there's been a real lack of

1193
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:42,340
attention to<font color="#E5E5E5"> an African agenda and you</font>

1194
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:45,340
all were very gracious to talk to the

1195
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:46,420
eigen officials about their level of

1196
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:48,040
commitment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their level of</font>

1197
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:49,510
cooperation I think that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

1198
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,790
but I think you really deserve to

1199
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:53,920
complement yourselves for all the hard

1200
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:56,440
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for years and years there wasn't</font>

1201
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,630
really an Africa agenda at I can there

1202
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,880
wasn't really an active Africa voice

1203
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:02,590
that I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know because I was often</font>

1204
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,570
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only people standing up with</font>

1205
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:05,920
the microphone saying hey wait there's

1206
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:08,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's the rest of the world that's</font>

1207
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,720
that's that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> being served here the</font>

1208
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:12,220
proof is in the pudding it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to</font>

1209
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,230
come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a plan the implementation</font>

1210
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:17,049
is always the hard part right and so I

1211
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:18,550
can only encourage everyone who is in

1212
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:19,990
this room and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's so many more</font>

1213
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:22,360
Africans in this room than there have

1214
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:25,240
ever been I can only encourage everyone

1215
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:26,920
to hold I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can accountable for the</font>

1216
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:28,899
promises that have been made and the

1217
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:30,130
best and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most important way to do</font>

1218
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:32,710
that is to get

1219
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:34,269
up stand up speak up there are many

1220
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:36,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who are like myself not</font>

1221
01:01:34,269 --> 01:01:38,049
originally from Africa who will very

1222
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:41,649
much will do that work very hard to

1223
01:01:38,049 --> 01:01:43,930
support you good luck so my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Rafa</font>

1224
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:45,579
chronic I'm from Tunisia and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jenna so</font>

1225
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:48,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">counsel for the non-commercial</font>

1226
01:01:45,579 --> 01:01:52,720
stakeholder group I want really to thank

1227
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:56,349
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people who lead this effort for</font>

1228
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:58,359
the in the African Africa strategy

1229
01:01:56,349 --> 01:02:01,119
working group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticing all the</font>

1230
01:01:58,359 --> 01:02:05,288
difficulties and the criticism by face

1231
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:08,349
it from the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself so this</font>

1232
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:11,109
strategy should help to increase the

1233
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:13,660
representation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all stakeholder groups</font>

1234
01:02:11,109 --> 01:02:16,359
and I want really to emphasize the

1235
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:18,759
non-commercial stakeholder group so we

1236
01:02:16,359 --> 01:02:21,640
are underrepresented from Africa

1237
01:02:18,759 --> 01:02:23,980
community especially this stakeholder

1238
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:28,118
groups so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need more efforts to bring</font>

1239
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:31,900
more people from Africa<font color="#CCCCCC"> and before all</font>

1240
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:34,329
the sub-region in Africa so this error

1241
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:36,160
still work to be done I think just<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1242
01:02:34,329 --> 01:02:38,410
are in the beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hope we will</font>

1243
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:42,069
continue and keeping doing this good job

1244
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:43,899
thank you yes thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I think we all</font>

1245
01:02:42,069 --> 01:02:47,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">agree that this was a great initiative</font>

1246
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:50,400
great work done and I think as we are

1247
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:53,618
<font color="#CCCCCC">all here it's also may be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

1248
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,690
take out or go leave this room with some

1249
01:02:53,619 --> 01:02:58,630
question and how we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1250
01:02:55,690 --> 01:03:03,099
reality because the work is good is for

1251
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:06,339
icon but how can we take out from this

1252
01:03:03,099 --> 01:03:09,190
strategy and localize them because I

1253
01:03:06,339 --> 01:03:12,880
fundamentally believe that we cannot

1254
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:16,779
impact I can and I can process if

1255
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:19,869
locally we do not do some some aspect of

1256
01:03:16,779 --> 01:03:22,690
some part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so one question I</font>

1257
01:03:19,869 --> 01:03:25,539
don't know if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time again that I</font>

1258
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:28,359
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably like us to discuss how can</font>

1259
01:03:25,539 --> 01:03:31,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">we localize this what can we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

1260
01:03:28,359 --> 01:03:34,920
individually as each of us level to take

1261
01:03:31,779 --> 01:03:37,660
this strategy and start building it at

1262
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:40,000
community level because participation<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1263
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:42,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can come from community participation</font>

1264
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,099
community engagement and all

1265
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:47,740
so the economical impact of all of this

1266
01:03:45,099 --> 01:03:50,260
if we don't have some strong industry if

1267
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:53,618
we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who can devote that</font>

1268
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:55,930
time devote their<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy and resource to</font>

1269
01:03:53,619 --> 01:03:58,869
this it won't succeed because I can is

1270
01:03:55,930 --> 01:04:00,669
not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to found everything so if we</font>

1271
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:04,390
have few time that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1272
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:07,810
