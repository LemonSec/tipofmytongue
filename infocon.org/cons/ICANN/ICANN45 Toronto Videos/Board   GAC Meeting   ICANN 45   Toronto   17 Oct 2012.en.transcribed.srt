<font color="#E5E5E5">probably begin I lost track I was</font>

55
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,989
thought about counting but but my my

56
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,670
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that there are roughly there's</font>

57
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:04,980
more than twice and perhaps three times

58
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:10,500
as many topics as we can actually deal

59
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:12,388
with in reality every one of them I

60
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:18,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to push back on any of them</font>

61
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:22,290
but I we do have a time problem not all

<font color="#CCCCCC">of these topics are or lengthy so and</font>

71
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">pleasure to meet with the board and have</font>

72
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:59,629
an exchange of views on a wide range<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,069
topics and we were very<font color="#E5E5E5"> grateful for the</font>

74
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:04,888
comprehensive response from from the

75
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:06,780
board to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> advice that a gang</font>

76
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:10,639
submitted in its communique in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prague</font>

77
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,900
that response was dated 13 October

78
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:16,199
Saturday which was the day we started

79
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,690
our meeting so I just wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> express</font>

80
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:22,169
on behalf of the committee our extreme

81
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:25,920
disappointment that we did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this</font>

82
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:30,409
response well in advance of our meeting

83
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:33,960
I'm sure you appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need</font>

84
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:36,780
responses in good time at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least two</font>

85
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,659
weeks before meeting so that we can

86
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:43,320
where necessary consult across national

87
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:46,830
administration's also many of us have

88
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:50,130
mechanisms for regional consultations so

89
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:53,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">any time to be allowed for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and also</font>

90
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:57,480
across the whole committee so in this

91
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:59,580
instance there were nine issues in the

92
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,880
park communicate and you have indeed

93
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,070
responded on on all nine issues and that

94
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">reflects the wide range of issues of</font>

95
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:10,530
public policy interests that are

96
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:13,890
exercising us at this time I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

97
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:16,770
perhaps you were not able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reply on</font>

98
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:19,440
everyone in good time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the beating you</font>

99
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,409
could have perhaps considered a holding

100
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,030
reply on individual items and then

101
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,310
ensure that we could work efficiently

102
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,530
and effectively on those issues where

103
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,300
you were ready with a reply which we

104
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,609
would have had in good time so I just

105
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,100
wanted briefly to sort of flag that up

106
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,640
as an issue of great concern to us and

107
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:43,470
hopefully yeah you know there won't be a

108
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:46,020
rarity well I appreciate and since I

109
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:49,230
signed the communique I was there to

110
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:52,859
play a role but there's a process there

111
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:55,110
and I actually found myself confused and

112
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,530
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my confusion and I'm</font>

113
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:01,020
speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for myself without having</font>

114
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,820
previously coordinated this with any of

115
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:09,630
my colleagues on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the board</font>

116
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:12,140
or the staff you sent us<font color="#E5E5E5"> a communique we</font>

117
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:15,990
have had a long discussion very

118
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:19,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">effective to build what's called the GAC</font>

119
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:22,680
register and to find a process that is

120
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,620
intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take pieces to take advice</font>

121
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,500
from the GAC and enter it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

122
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:31,130
register<font color="#E5E5E5"> and slice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up so that we</font>

123
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,690
could deal with each piece and a

124
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">four-step</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process for entering it in</font>

125
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:38,640
make it getting assurance that we've

126
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,220
heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> you clearly getting an assessment</font>

127
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,469
of how long<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

128
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,660
take to answer or deal with each one

129
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,690
then the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> of actually responding</font>

130
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:50,260
and then a<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrap-up for each one of those</font>

131
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:52,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">I labored and again I'm speaking quite</font>

132
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,909
personally here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I labored under the</font>

133
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:58,419
misconception apparently that that was

134
00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:03,100
the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I was caught unawares</font>

135
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:05,290
that a response<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the communique in the</font>

136
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,060
same in the classic sense that we've

137
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,160
always responded that is a letter going

138
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,330
back responding point by point I don't

139
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">have any objection to that but I</font>

140
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,550
actually am a little confused as to what

141
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,770
the relationship is of the formal

142
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,380
response that we send back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font>

143
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:23,909
register process and I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

144
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:30,400
probably not best to use this time but I

145
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:32,590
I say this as a substantive response to

146
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,549
your complaint which I fully understand

147
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:39,039
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take on board in that I think we're</font>

148
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:42,070
mutually interested in making the

149
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,710
process as efficient as possible and I

150
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:47,260
think we're at the late stages where

151
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,210
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more discussion</font>

152
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,469
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can iron out what that process is</font>

153
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,979
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've built</font>

154
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,720
a very strong foundation for trying to

155
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:59,050
be effective and efficient about

156
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:03,400
processing the communications from the

157
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:06,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">GAC and and again I emphasize that</font>

158
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:10,090
perhaps the staff in perhaps the the

159
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,890
members<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the board gack working group</font>

160
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,570
are more knowledgeable of this but I'm

161
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,090
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I quite see how all the pieces</font>

162
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,440
fit together but I do believe that we

163
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,830
have all the basis there and that a

164
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:26,520
little bit of a further coordination

165
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:29,050
will solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> that problem thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

166
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,348
so with that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can move to the</font>

167
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,240
next item<font color="#E5E5E5"> which the US will raise in</font>

168
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:38,789
relation to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> registrar accreditation</font>

169
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,789
agreement and a request made to the GAC

170
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:43,569
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> madam chair</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and thank you</font>

171
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,760
colleagues from the board it's always as

172
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:48,070
usual nice to have this opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

173
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,510
the direct exchange this should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

174
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,279
fairly brief it's it's more of a

175
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:54,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">question for clarification as to timing</font>

176
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:57,350
as you all know we did receive from

177
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:59,449
staff a set of questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

178
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,970
existing I can procedure for handling

179
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:05,540
who is conflicts with national privacy

180
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,310
laws several weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago it did it was a</font>

181
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,959
very very interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> letter and I think</font>

182
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,569
it posed some very good questions for us

183
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:16,369
that letter did not contain a specific

184
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:18,199
deadline per se and in meeting with

185
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,439
ICANN staff and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Registrar</font>

186
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:24,769
negotiating team in September it was our

187
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:26,930
understanding then that the registrar's

188
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:29,660
themselves were going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> also look at</font>

189
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:32,209
the procedure and the goal was on both

190
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,309
all parties parts to determine whether

191
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:36,888
that procedure needed to be updated or

192
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:41,269
tweaked or slightly amended did we need

193
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:45,230
to to bring it more up to date we had

194
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:48,769
been contemplating or expecting that we

195
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:53,449
would perhaps link a GAC response to the

196
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:54,649
original letter to whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> RA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a text</font>

197
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:56,569
was going to be posted<font color="#CCCCCC"> for public</font>

198
00:09:54,649 --> 00:10:01,430
comment and we would tackle them at the

199
00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:04,069
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time however we have noted that in</font>

200
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,829
your written response to the GAC Prague

201
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:10,128
communique there seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

202
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:12,319
suggestion that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are going to provide</font>

203
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:14,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the GAC shortly and I'm quoting now from</font>

204
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:16,969
the the letter with some proposed

205
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,399
revisions to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> icam procedure for our</font>

206
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,290
consideration and input which suggests

207
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,569
to me that we no longer need to actually

208
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,059
answer the original letter we are

209
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:28,189
waiting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> new text so I would</font>

210
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:30,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate clarification there but the</font>

211
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:32,660
more important point where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

212
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:36,290
really benefit for some clarification is

213
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:38,750
the the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> paragraph that says quite</font>

214
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:41,120
correctly these are important areas the

215
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,379
crux of the negotiations I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

216
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,660
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work with law enforcement</font>

217
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:46,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">and registrar's to develop an agreement</font>

218
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,309
that meets law enforcement goals until

219
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,920
agreement is reached in these key areas

220
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:54,829
i can has postponed the posting of a

221
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,110
jointly negotiated agreement so now

222
00:10:54,829 --> 00:11:01,399
we're left sort of confused as to are we

223
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:03,110
to expect a set of revised questions on

224
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:05,520
the procedures for handling who is

225
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,670
conflicts with national privacy law

226
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,920
and is that now a precondition to

227
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:12,689
posting a revised our agreement for

228
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,370
public comment because of course we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

229
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:22,590
still wish to<font color="#E5E5E5"> review the agreement and</font>

230
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:27,030
provide comment thank you I don't have a

231
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:29,850
full answer but we will post that I can

232
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:33,000
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that we plan to post a new ra</font>

233
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:37,770
agreement or the result of our work and

234
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,470
a proposed ra agreement in<font color="#E5E5E5"> December so</font>

235
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:43,140
that's the plan because obviously we are

236
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,300
conscious that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gnudi TLD program and</font>

237
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,580
now that we've announced a solution to

238
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:50,640
the prioritization is going to happen

239
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,230
now sooner than we had planned so we'd

240
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,850
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get this wrapped up and ready</font>

241
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,920
and presented to the community<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

242
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">December but I still haven't answered</font>

243
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:02,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">your question as to whether we want to</font>

244
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:05,130
expect we need to get some data<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you</font>

245
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,350
now or you're waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

246
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,960
instructions from us before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can give</font>

247
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:12,060
us more data I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> need some help to</font>

248
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,500
answer that question from my team so if

249
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:23,609
someone from my<font color="#E5E5E5"> team is here that can</font>

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:25,170
answer this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kurt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wall hi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah thank</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">suzanne there our response to the letter</font>

253
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:36,690
is not required at this time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

254
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:41,069
does plan to post a revision<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

255
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:42,810
procedure for taking exception to who is

256
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,720
requirements based on national law

257
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:49,699
revised to accommodate data retention

258
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,750
also and posting the agreement and that

259
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:55,310
posting of that procedure is not a

260
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:57,720
prerequisite to posting the agreement<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

261
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:00,209
think having an agreement in place is a

262
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,790
prerequisite to finally approving the

263

<font color="#CCCCCC">Raa but that'll you know the posted Rea</font>

264
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,290

265

comment in the meantime we will post the

266

revision to the procedure have public

267
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:16,720

270
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,959

273
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:30,279
both of them yes but the original letter

274
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:33,610
we should put to one side that's crush

talk about privacy issues and who is I

that the letter that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was received from</font>

the deep I think it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DPA and the</font>

286
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:04,000
European Union am suggesting that the

00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:20,560
of that of that letter because I

294
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,559
understand that the that the what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

295
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">called the article 29 working party is</font>

296
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:27,910
an independent authority and that

297
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,649
therefore that I need we need to get to

298
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,589
clarify that the opinion you know the

299
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:34,149
opinion expressed by them in its letter

300
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:36,910
won't have any legal repercussions in

301
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:39,189
the in the European Union I wonder if

302
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:44,740
there's any any help you can give us on

303
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:49,269
that EU Commission thank you very much

chair well just to to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone at</font>

305
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:56,649

306
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:59,649
group of and concerning your data

307
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:03,220
protection and it's called article 29

308
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:05,230
based on a directive that is steering

309
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,439
this and they're there to give advice

310
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:10,449
and they themselves and we as well are

311
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:12,779
very clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the fact that they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

independent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the European Commission</font>

not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ye you position as such but this</font>

Australia regarding due diligence Thank

brief um it's really seeking a

322
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,550
clarification<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as i've mentioned in</font>

323
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,649
previous meetings there and there's many

324
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,300
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess there are two parts to the</font>

325
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:57,040
law<font color="#CCCCCC"> enforcement recommendations one</font>

326
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,250
which deal with amendments to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Raa</font>

327
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,529
and a second part which do with due

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:05,260
diligence activities recommendations for

329
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:07,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">i can i understand there's been progress</font>

330
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:11,529
in the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those areas and it</font>

331
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:13,300
appears that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board's response to the</font>

332
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:14,860
prod communique seems to indicate that

333
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,069
there's progress in another area or

334
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:21,820
mentioned some auditing and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so but</font>

335
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:24,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm just not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear whether i can fuels</font>

336
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,260
it is fully implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,330
recommendations there's there's four of

00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,649
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know there's been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> progress in</font>

339
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:33,279
some areas there appears to be progress

340
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:36,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">in others but i'm simply not sure so</font>

341
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,810
some clarification at some stage as to

342
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:39,790
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can consider there is still</font>

343
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,709
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> outstanding in that area or</font>

344
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:45,209
anything that it's not going to do for

345
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,209
some reason just<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be very useful</font>

346
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,589

the details of where we are with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that or</font>

357
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,649
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should wait till this is posted in a</font>

358
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,260
couple of weeks here in a couple of

359

months but i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> let him come at them he</font>

360
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:45,830
may have more details on us<font color="#E5E5E5"> australia</font>

361
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:48,440
deal thank you but just just to clarify

362
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:51,199
its it's a separate issue as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

363
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,950
understand it from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raa process so</font>

364
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,230
there's a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommendations</font>

365
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,120
about amendments to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raa and then</font>

366
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:58,610
some separate things which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can can do</font>

367
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:02,199
administratively effectively so it's a

368
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,199
question about those ones in particular

369
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,750
first video thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you is pressed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ogden</font>

370
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:11,260
speaking I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what Australia is</font>

371
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:14,240
referring to<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is that there are</font>

372
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,500
there's a register accreditation

373
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,240
agreement which is currently being

374
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,150
negotiated which is the agreement with

375
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">an accredited registrar I believe</font>

376
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,110
Australia is referring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the process</font>

377
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">that happens before that effectively</font>

378
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,620
before already Australia's are credited

379
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,110
and that there's a series of due

380
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:33,860
diligence requirements that staff used

381
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:35,870
before accrediting a registrar and I

382
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:39,080
think question from Australia is have

383
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:41,540
those law enforcement recommendations

384
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,810
been taken into account in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICANN's</font>

385
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:46,040
accreditation process<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability that's the</font>

386
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,899
question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we don't have an</font>

387
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,480
immediate answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually just agree to</font>

388
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:54,320
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an answer back later if someone's</font>

389
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,940
not available to respond I I think we're

390
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,428
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to provide an answer later</font>

391
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:02,030
this is kurt prêts we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> recently</font>

392
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:04,340
upgraded the accreditation process to

393
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:06,410
include background checks for example as

394
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:09,139
part of the accreditation so within the

395
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:12,020
past year that's been included but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

396

of the law enforcement<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommendations</font>

00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:27,899
from I can't say anything committal

438
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,850
beyond what<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is said because as he</font>

441
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:41,740
quite properly noted if we cast these as

442
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:45,429
formal rules we'll have to make a bylaw

443
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:51,460
change which is a certain amount of work

444
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:53,830
in time all that said my view of those

445
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:58,240
two aspects setting a time<font color="#E5E5E5"> deadline and</font>

case there is have have a certain common

448
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,620
sense to them in the first case to make

449
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,210
sure that the process is not in listen

450
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:10,479
that it has timed out in the second one

451
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:14,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">is from a purely political point of view</font>

irrespective of what the threshold is

whether it's a majority as it is today

459
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:39,520
follow gac advice we'd better have quite

particular categories or kinds of

questions we had was how in fact

494
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,680
on in the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> so these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

497
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:47,860
in relation to those concerns now would

be the time thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm with regard to</font>

499
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:53,300
incorporating restrictions into

00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:56,470
agreements and enforcing them the guide

501
00:24:53,300 --> 00:25:00,020
book is written so that if a an

502
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:02,840
applicant registers themselves as a

503
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:04,310
community applicant and identifies the

504
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,230
restrictions associated with

505
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:08,659
representing that community those

506
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:13,370
restrictions will be included into the

507
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:16,730
agreement and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can will hold the</font>

the applicant to that with regard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,070
that into account and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend</font>

512
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:30,789
that

514
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:36,129
know what's appropriate so I apologize

515
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,130
register those concerns with us and have

516
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:42,299
discussions with applicants about

517
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:46,750
restrictions around their registry that

518
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:49,240
using those real cases that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gac and</font>

519
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,880
and I can can discuss at that time how

520
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:57,309
those restrictions might be included

521
00:25:51,880 --> 00:26:03,250
into an agreement let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> also ask of</font>

Bertrand<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah Beth Melissa babe I take</font>

523
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:08,590
the opportunity of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> question to</font>

524
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,529
actually ask the guy can return to see

525
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,418
whether you have considered a type of

526
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:16,090
situation whereby<font color="#CCCCCC"> for instance a</font>

527
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:18,610
government gives a letter of<font color="#E5E5E5"> support to</font>

528
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:21,879
a particular application in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the course</font>

529
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:23,830
of the process and for whatever reason

530
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:25,389
at the national level like a change of

531
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:28,678
government or change of the local

532
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:32,758
authority or so the new authorities

533
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:35,289
considers that this application or this

534
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:37,779
TLD which has been in operation for a

535
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:41,169
couple of years for instance is actually

536
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:43,750
not the one that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> authority would</font>

537
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:46,330
like to continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support we would be</font>

538
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,740
then in a situation for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a gtld that</font>

539
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:50,710
would amount to the equivalent of a

540
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:52,659
reallocation for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ccs without the</font>

541
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:54,070
framework for read allegation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CC</font>

542
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:56,919
so I just want to interject this

543
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:58,750
question as a sort of symmetrical

544
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:01,019
question on whether the GAC has

545
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,820
considered this and whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

546
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:06,220
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> provide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some some kind of</font>

547
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,918
feedback at a later stage on such a

548
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:11,320
situation because this impacts the

549
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:14,500
stability and the predictability for the

550
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,658
operators of gTLDs regarding the

551
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:20,590
agreements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they have received</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very encouraged to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear that so I</font>

561
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,049
question 20 in the community

00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,299
applications so that there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

563
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:51,460
they will turn up in contracts and be

564
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:54,700
enforced I think we're equally

565
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,500
interested in the question 18 which is I

566
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,539
believe for all applicants and covers

567
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,820
issues such as the mission and purpose

568
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:03,450
but more particularly the measures the

569
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:06,850
operating rules to minimize social costs

570
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:09,789
and I've heard some mixed answers as to

571
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:12,820
whether the commitments that applicants

572
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:14,230
or the promises<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever we call them</font>

573
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:18,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">that applicants are making in that</font>

574
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:20,049
question whether they will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

575
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:22,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">contracts with I can and enforced</font>

576
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:24,610
subject to<font color="#CCCCCC"> enforcement and the reason we</font>

577
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:27,340
ask is this question is one of the

578
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:30,459
obviously the key questions for CAC

579
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:32,949
members assessing<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld applications to</font>

580
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:36,039
see if there are any issues of<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern</font>

581
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:40,149
essentially I can speak for Australia in

582
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:42,669
that in many cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> none of the strings</font>

583
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:44,110
or not not many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the strings look</font>

584
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:45,730
particularly worrying in and of

585
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:47,799
themselves that's how they will

586
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:52,929
essentially be run where our concerns

587
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:55,090
will lie so I appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing whether</font>

588
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:56,909
whether those commitments that people of

589
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:59,590
my applicants have made in question 18

590
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:02,980
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in contracts and subject to</font>

591
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:05,678
enforcement<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer I can I thank you</font>

592
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,750
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the question the way the</font>

593
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,940
guidebook was configured was like you

594
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:11,710
said to incorporate the community

595
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:15,549
restrictions and create restrictions

596
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:20,700
there there was a ballot and was those

597
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:24,820
other those social costs questions were

598
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:27,010
really about to get applicants concerned

599
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,809
about those issues when there is a

600
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:31,419
balancing of how there was a balancing

601
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:34,270
of how to incorporate such restrictions

602
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:36,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">and also and also allow for changing</font>

603
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:41,320
business models over time so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the</font>

604
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:43,239
current model<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is configured only the</font>

605
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:47,200
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community based restrictions are</font>

606
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:51,750
required but but like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said earlier it</font>

607
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,380
once we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> start hearing the GAC</font>

608
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,810
early warnings

609
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:58,360
got concerns about specific examples i

610
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:02,020
think in real time we can engage with

611
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,729
the applicants to consider incorporating

612
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:06,639
additional restrictions into the

613
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:08,200
agreement it was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do just</font>

614
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,290
as a final explanation was hard to do a

615
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,610
priori with a blind question knowing

616
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,200
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not we'd be able to</font>

617
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,459
incorporate those restrictions in the

618
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,720
agreement<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were the answers to</font>

619
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:21,310
question 18 Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Curt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have Chris</font>

620
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,540
to Spain and in Australia for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

621
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:27,010
follow-up thank you um I think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

622
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to break</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this down into two into two</font>

623
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:33,220
distinct areas yeah first of all in

624
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:35,679
respect to question question 18 there is

625
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,970
there is a those are those are

626
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:40,090
statements that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make in your</font>

627
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:42,670
application and there is a clause that

628
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,110
says that you will warrant you in the

629
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,550
registry contract you warrant that

630
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:49,030
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've said in your</font>

631
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:51,940
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> is true and and will you</font>

632
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:54,550
know will continue so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that specific</font>

633
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,470
area I actually think and I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

634
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:58,180
lawyers hats firmly screwed onto my head

635
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:01,240
right now I actually think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I can</font>

636
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:05,650
would be in and it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rely</font>

637
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:08,170
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> warranty and I'm not stressed</font>

638
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:10,930
here i'm not giving legal advice rely on

639
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:13,470
the warranty in the in the registry

640
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:16,420
license agreement in respect to

641
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:19,930
circumstances where you are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

642
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:21,640
take an example you you object you have

643
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:24,280
put an<font color="#E5E5E5"> early</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> warning up on a particular</font>

644
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,960
string and the purpose of the early

645
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,490
warning was to allow people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come to</font>

646
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,380
you and say well explain to us what your

647
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:31,420
problem is and and you will see if we

648
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:34,150
can we can assist you so if you then

649
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:37,060
reach you then reach terms with the

650
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:39,010
applicant that<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that you will you</font>

651
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">are comfortable and you withdraw your</font>

652
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:43,600
early warning and you decide not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

653
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:46,690
object what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking is how do we</font>

654
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:51,360
ensure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you've agreed with the</font>

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the applicant is actually</font>

656
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:57,719
adhered to and it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that area where I</font>

657
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,830
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> work is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work is required so I</font>

658
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,120
don't have an answer but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

659
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that we work very clear what</font>

660
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:07,469
we were talking about is that's the area

661
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:09,960
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work is required oh yeah thank</font>

665
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:24,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole problem so to explain and again I</font>

666
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:28,889
won't pick a particular example but

667
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:31,350
string X is in a sensitive sector a

668
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:35,820
regulated sector in a in the country in

669
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:37,860
many countries or all countries and in

670
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,270
in in its response to how will minimize

671
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,850
social harm or the mission<font color="#E5E5E5"> and purpose</font>

672
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:44,220
so that answers in question 18 assures

673
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:46,500
that it will do up front vetting limited

674
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,530
registration policies a whole bunch of

675
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:51,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which sound extremely good</font>

676
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:55,920
governments may choose not to issue an

677
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:59,070
early warning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what happens if they</font>

678
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,570
don't live up to those commitments so

679
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:03,780
there's a warrant<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it won't turn up</font>

680
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:06,689
in a contract<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hbu really keen to know</font>

681
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:08,760
what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen so let me let</font>

682
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:11,400
me try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me see if this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> item may</font>

683
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,410
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's try it says all material</font>

684
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,720
information provided and statements made

685
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:17,190
in the registry TLD application and

686
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,320
statements made in writing during the

687
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:21,660
negotiation of this agreement were true

688
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,669
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct in all material respects at</font>

00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">the time made and shut and such</font>

690
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,910
information or statements continued to

691
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:29,219
be true and correct in all material

692
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,540
respects as of the effective date except

693
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,370
as otherwise previously disclosed in

694
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:36,409
writing by the registry operator to I

695
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:39,689
can't so so that is that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in part</font>

696
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:41,970
that's that's a warranty in respect to

697
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:44,340
the statements made now the legitimate

698
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:46,800
question for you that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

699
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,330
asking and i agree with you is yes and

700
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:52,050
then what happens if they don't carry

701
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:54,830
that out so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that we need to</font>

702
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,830
answer that<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

703
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:04,659
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just add I have a few requests</font>

704
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:07,990
to speak but part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the question is</font>

705
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:10,849
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens what what is the process</font>

706
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:15,219
when they're there is a change or a

707
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:20,240
material change later on as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct</font>

708
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:23,569
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could receive an answer about</font>

709
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:28,009
that as well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's there's well how</font>

710
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:30,109
to warrant the contents<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the agreement</font>

711
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:32,240
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then if you're expecting that things</font>

712
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:35,058
can change over time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've noted</font>

713
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:37,540
they can with the existing top-level

714
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:39,859
domains then what's the process for that

715
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:44,808
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so i have UK Spain and Germany</font>

716
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:47,480
please yes thanks very much at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> sum</font>

717
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:50,839
I support very much what Australia is

718
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,940
positing here with which is reflecting

719
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:56,149
what a lot of our regulators are saying

720
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:58,250
they're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> face of it</font>

721
00:34:56,149 --> 00:35:00,618
some of these proposals seem to have due

722
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:06,500
regard for the public interest for the

723
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:08,900
consumer interest for these domain these

724
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,690
registries which are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

725
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:13,579

726
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:17,059
regulated and they're regulated because

727
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:19,030
there are inherent risks extensive risks

728
00:35:17,059 --> 00:35:21,349
and there is extreme nervousness

729
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:24,290

very obvious ones so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

735
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:41,750
for is assurances that I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> will follow</font>

736
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:43,430
through and ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is good</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that's what we're sort of reflecting</font>

746
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:12,600
here and we will discuss this

747
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:15,480
further in the gac of course but we

748
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:17,339
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> flag this up now and you know</font>

749
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,770
we've all been relying on the answers to

may be some change in the situation will

758
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:47,790
give that some further thought I just

is aware of from an exchange earlier in

761
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:57,110
the week that the UK would like to see

762

those government<font color="#CCCCCC"> authorised gTLDs be</font>

considered alongside the ID ends in that

764
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:04,800
first phase of evaluation that's the UK

768
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:18,240
those first points yeah simply to say

769
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:19,890
that these are important questions and

770
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,259
they can't be answered on the fly like

771
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:24,270
this I took note of it and we owe you an

772
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,460
answer certainly on the question of

773
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:28,920
enforcement and the assurances that the

774
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:32,220
UK was seeking so we took note of that

775
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">and as to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> request for prioritizing</font>

geographical detail DS or<font color="#CCCCCC"> tail these we</font>

777
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:42,510
also have noted that and we will respond

778
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:43,890
to that as well thank you it I need to

779
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,170
be clear that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's something under</font>

780
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:50,220
discussion in the gac so that's a

781
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:53,060
proposal from the UK it isn't yet a<font color="#E5E5E5"> gac</font>

782
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,799
view but it's it's in relation to to our

783
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:58,200
interest in certain categories and

784
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,530
thinking about what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the related</font>

785
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,149
issues to to those categories yeah

786
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:06,030
simply because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're receiving these</font>

787
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:07,770
requests also from outside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GAC and</font>

788
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,870
in fact some of the gap members also

789
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:12,870
have made these requests directly to us

790
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:15,060
as individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries so I'm aware of</font>

791
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:16,680
this need and at least we'll wait for

792
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,840
your full advice but we will also

793
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,529
respond in general because there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

794
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:25,280
of requests for advancing certain

795

50 of these ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of others so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

801
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:53,029
touch upon some of the general issues

that arise from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> d new utility</font>

process as well as to<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow on some of</font>

804
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:04,280
the comments made by my colleagues from

00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:07,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">australia and the UK but i'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

please put<font color="#E5E5E5"> on their nose or or not great</font>

809
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,950
on there in the screen thank you

810
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:35,380
the other day we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation on</font>

811
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:39,349
a proposal to establish a certain order

812
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:43,579
for the allocation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the domains that</font>

813
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:45,800
have been requested I hope that proposal

814
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:49,220
is not closed it's not completely closed

815
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:52,220
and I hope some changes can be admitted

816
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:56,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that the possibility to introduce</font>

817
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,259
some modifications is admitted as well I

818
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:05,259
would put a note to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> system and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

819
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:10,460
a fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very neutral very</font>

820
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:13,010
objective but I think it does not

821
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:15,099
respect the principle of equality in the

822
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:19,520
sense that the principle of equality

823
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:22,069
implies trying or rather treating the

824
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,839
different applications in a different

825
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:30,020
fashion and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this hasn't been</font>

826
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:33,920
really taken into account with a

827
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:36,280
specific treatment to the applications

828
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:40,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">that have certain peculiarities implies</font>

829
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:44,420
not to apply a random criterion but

830
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:49,150
rather to consider public interest

831
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:52,220
principles and considering the aim of

832
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:55,069
increasing the diversity cultural

833
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:58,700
diversity geographical diversity etc on

834
00:40:55,069 --> 00:41:02,109
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet in this sense I believe it</font>

835
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:05,140
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have placed</font>

836
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:09,828
multilingual domains in the first place

00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:13,160
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though there are some applications</font>

838
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:15,470

839
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:21,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">come from multilingual countries that</font>

840
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:23,569
actually they attempt to obtain domains

841
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:24,950
that are already existing but they want

842
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:27,290
to have the translations in their

843
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:30,609
respective languages I think this is

844
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:33,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that has to be reviewed I</font>

to convey values interests that are

873
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:19,930
applied for such a long number do

874
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:23,200
actually have an interest of making use

875
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:25,680
of that domain aside from the financial

887
00:43:54,010 --> 00:44:03,070
are not very large numbers to alter the

<font color="#CCCCCC">the rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the world in the sense that</font>

895
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:27,279

00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:34,870
very important that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can take advantage</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of this a process to improve its image</font>

900
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:48,520
the image we have of icon is that this

<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a multi-stakeholder model and this is</font>

applying these in our country in our

904
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:01,990
government policies but in the end it's

905
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:04,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same companies that gets a benefit</font>

906
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:08,709
from this this is an organization that

907
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:11,500
continues to look to itself it seems

908
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:13,360
you're only considering the registering

909
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:16,960
company that can pincer that register

910
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:20,440

<font color="#E5E5E5">really administer anything but actually</font>

914
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:41,500
you know this depends on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

915
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:43,780
and so following<font color="#E5E5E5"> this line I support the</font>

916
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,790
comments made by my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Australian</font>

concerned by the consequences that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

919
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:55,360
can have four entities that have not

<font color="#E5E5E5">really looked for this process but they</font>

921
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:02,550
will see that their rights are affected

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:05,640
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> these new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld programs</font>

923
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:07,230
I'm sorry I have talked for so long and

924
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,629
thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much for a paying</font>

925
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:14,310
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me thank you Thank You</font>

926
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:16,230
Spain these questions were discussed to

927
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:19,080
some extent yesterday as part of the

928
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:21,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">high-level meeting and those messages</font>

929
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:24,540
will be communicated I think what is

930
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,150
most pressing for us this afternoon is

931
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:28,920
are the tasks in front of the GAC

932
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:32,550
presently which relate to gac early

933
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:34,680
warning and gac advice setting timelines

934
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:38,460
ensuring that there is clarity around

935
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:41,160
what what mechanisms exist in relation

936
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:43,230
to to the the applications and the

937
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:47,100
commitments that that are being made<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

938
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:48,720
and how any agreements that can be

939
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:54,299
reached with applications around

940
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:56,279
concerns can can be accommodated in in

941
00:46:54,300 --> 00:47:00,420
one instrument or one mechanism or

942
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:03,150
another so with that I will move us to

943
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:10,500
the next agenda item I think we've

944
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:15,480
raised our concerns and is it to this

945
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:18,120
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right Germany please if</font>

946
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,430
you could be brief and then we can move

947
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:23,609
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next thank you thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you for</font>

948
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:26,430
allowing me also to speak in sorry and I

949
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:28,920
we try to be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very brief I will come</font>

950
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:30,120
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the questions we had from from</font>

951
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:34,490
our colleague from Australia and

952
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:39,270
colleague from UK and it is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

953
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:41,459
respect how safeguarding a public policy

954
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:44,100
interest in in in respect of the new

955
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:48,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">gTLD process and in particular in</font>

956
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:51,900
respect of some of the charity<font color="#E5E5E5"> as in a</font>

957
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:55,110
regulated markets and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would ask to</font>

958
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:59,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">what extent it is really necessary now</font>

959
00:47:55,110 --> 00:48:03,810
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> decide on specific requirements and</font>

960
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:07,860
really define them<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly because</font>

961
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:12,330
normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think where we have in these</font>

962
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:15,210
markets we have a legal framework in

963
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:19,350
various jurisdictions and that should be

964
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:22,980
generally sufficient but if there is

965
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:26,640
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of misleading of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GD le then</font>

966
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:29,460
I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have still some possibilities</font>

967
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,200
and if I say wake me it's a gag on one

968
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:33,060
side but I a thing cause of i can has a

969
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,830
possibility to intervene and it would be

970
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:39,150
interesting to what extent this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

971
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:42,990
possible and maybe we could have also

972
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:44,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">some clarification in what cases is good</font>

973
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:47,250
well probably it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one way</font>

974
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:52,560
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can can intervene in this fact</font>

975
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:55,080
thank you thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Germany</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so with</font>

976
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:59,340
that let's move to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next item which</font>

977
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:02,069
relates to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the process followed in</font>

978
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:03,840
relation to the IOC and<font color="#E5E5E5"> red cross</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

979
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:08,670
I'm looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the United States to</font>

980
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:10,800
raise this with the board please thank

981
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:12,630
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> madam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chair and I I won't be very</font>

982
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,090
long on this so I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can help us</font>

983
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:18,270
make up for some lost time we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken</font>

984
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:21,300
note obviously of your sep tember 13<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

985
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:24,780
believe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is your resolution and are</font>

986
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:27,780
now we have an eye on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> January 2013</font>

987
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:30,390
date that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> established we are</font>

988
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:34,040
also of course very mindful of a

989
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:37,500
recently posted recommendation from the

990
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:41,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">gns OHS drafting team on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IOC Red</font>

991
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:43,830
Cross issues and we just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to flag</font>

992
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:46,049
something for you today because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font>

993
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:47,910
have sufficient time to engage in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a more</font>

994
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:50,490
detailed conversation I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would</font>

995
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:53,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite like to do so at a future meeting</font>

996
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:56,879
and a lot will hinge i believe on what

997
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:59,190
happens inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh with this</font>

998
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,680
recommendation and whether the gns so

999
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:03,780
does in fact determine to accept the

1000
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:06,210
recommendation to initiate a PDP a

1001
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:08,010
policy development process what we

1002
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:11,790
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> flag with you today is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1003
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:13,890
it's we remain a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit unclear or a</font>

1004
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:18,779
lot unclear let me just go right ahead

1005
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:21,210
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we're unclear as to there we go</font>

1006
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:25,440
no ambiguity there

1007
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:27,480
as to a case like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a situation where</font>

1008
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gac has provided advice that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1009
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,310
based and in this case it's kind of

1010
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,800
unique<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thing based very very directly</font>

1011
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:36,660
on national laws and international

1012
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,360
treaties specifically the treaties that

1013
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:43,290
we negotiate we sign and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

1014
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:44,640
signatories and we are responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1015
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:47,160
the provisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> for upholding the</font>

1016
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:50,210
provisions of those treaties so this

1017
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:53,549
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of advice was promised</font>

1018
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:58,730
completely on those<font color="#E5E5E5"> two sort of</font>

1019
00:50:53,550 --> 00:51:00,540
categories and maybe we are we take our

1020
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:03,090
responsibilities for our laws and

1021
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:05,430
interpreting them and for interpreting

1022
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:07,110
our responsibilities under any

1023
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:10,980
international treaty very very seriously

1024
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:13,470
so when we offer advice that is premise

1025
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,850
on those two bases we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1026
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,640
we are giving you the best you could

1027
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:20,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">possibly get obviously that's a</font>

1028
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:22,770
sovereign perspective on such things so

1029
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:26,850
when we then find ourselves in a

1030
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:28,170
situation where that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was apparently let</font>

1031
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:31,230
me put this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other way it's a</font>

1032
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:34,260
question what was missing in the gac

1033
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:36,680
advice that would lead the board and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1034
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:39,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">gns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> o to believe they need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> develop</font>

1035
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:41,850
policy so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to us whether</font>

1036
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:45,270
the policy would be focused on trying to

1037
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:47,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">interpret our laws and our treaty</font>

1038
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:52,380
obligations which we would find fairly

1039
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:54,089
troublesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> or whether the policy should</font>

1040
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:56,970
actually be called implementation

1041
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:59,610
because the advice based on its legal

1042
00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:00,990
premises is accepted or considered

1043
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:03,420
acceptable I think you're outside

1044
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:05,310
counsel thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right based</font>

1045
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,860
on the unredacted version of the staff

1046
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:09,840
paper but maybe there are some

1047
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:11,220
implementation details to be worked out

1048
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I think we would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be more than happy</font>

1049
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,240
to engage in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and to better</font>

1050
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:18,560
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I think is leaving</font>

1051
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:21,479
a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> question mark in our minds is</font>

1052
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:24,810
where is the policy requirement coming

1053
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:27,540
in and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we then interact with</font>

1054
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:30,540
whatever that process is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so again not to</font>

1055
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:32,250
be debated<font color="#E5E5E5"> today but I think it has come</font>

1056
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:34,150
up for those<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you board members who</font>

1057
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:35,799
are not members of the BGR I

1058
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:38,319
and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill pointed out you haven't had</font>

1059
00:52:35,799 --> 00:52:40,119
a chance to kind of review things we

1060
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:42,730
have kind of floated that as a possible

1061
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:44,589
case study because this I think raises a

1062
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:49,630
very important question for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of us</font>

1063
00:52:44,589 --> 00:52:56,049
thank you I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to offer a comment I</font>

1064
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:59,559
think there is some possible assumptions

1065
00:52:56,049 --> 00:53:05,770
or misunderstandings and possibly some

1066
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:07,990
some rough edges in our processes the if

1067
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:10,990
I understand the question you're asking

1068
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:17,859
it contains the assumption that we have

1069
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:22,240
sent the advice that you're you're

1070
00:53:17,859 --> 00:53:24,520
giving us which is based upon policies

1071
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,169
and commitments that you made that we're

1072
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">sending this over to the gns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so for a</font>

1073
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:31,180
policy development process and I think

1074
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:33,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's not what what we've ever intended</font>

1075
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:39,640
even though it<font color="#CCCCCC"> may have looked like that</font>

1076
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:43,089
and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> untangle that we do need</font>

1077
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:44,980
in all cases no matter what we're

1078
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:48,250
talking about to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know</font>

1079
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:51,309
what it is that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing we seek</font>

1080
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:53,829
sometimes some clarification some advice

1081
00:53:51,309 --> 00:53:58,390
some other inputs implementation details

1082
00:53:53,829 --> 00:54:00,789
and you know not unimportant is also the

1083
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:02,740
socialization of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

1084
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:05,500
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a decision it doesn't catch</font>

1085
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:08,709
everybody else by surprise but all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1086
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:11,020
that falls well short of seeking a new

1087
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:12,930
policy development process for something

1088
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:17,410
that you've given<font color="#CCCCCC"> us well structured and</font>

1089
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:20,558
advice on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suspect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have not</font>

1090
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:23,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">been crisp in our processes I think it</font>

1091
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:26,079
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely helpful to have this kind</font>

1092
00:54:23,589 --> 00:54:27,970
of dialogue<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to iron out that</font>

1093
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:31,569
language and lay out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sequence of</font>

1094
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:33,970
steps and to make it clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in our</font>

1095
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:37,359
internal communications as it were we

1096
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:40,629
are not ignoring you or creating a new

1097
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:44,549
parallel process of some sort anybody

1098
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:44,549
else want to add to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shireen</font>

1099
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:54,558
not much but so then I we have

1100
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:56,959
correspondent on the IOC and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Red Cross</font>

1101
00:54:54,559 --> 00:55:01,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think this would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a good case</font>

1102
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:04,299
study frankly and because we are always

1103
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:07,008
positively biased to accept the advice

1104
00:55:04,299 --> 00:55:09,380
we're also positively biased to do due

1105
00:55:07,009 --> 00:55:11,150
diligence in certain cases but your

1106
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:12,950
highlight here is that we've just<font color="#CCCCCC"> given</font>

1107
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:15,230
you pure advice based on international

1108
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:18,049
law and so on and so forth what more do

1109
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:20,569
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want and I think we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to really</font>

1110
00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:22,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">study this so that if there are mistakes</font>

1111
00:55:20,569 --> 00:55:25,999
or if there are things which are not

1112
00:55:22,009 --> 00:55:27,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">working well we eliminate them in the</font>

1113
00:55:25,999 --> 00:55:32,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">future so let's use that as a case study</font>

1114
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:35,420
and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we work on that but in all</font>

1115
00:55:32,569 --> 00:55:38,900
cases I took note and we owe you an

1116
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:40,819
answer of clarity as to what is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1117
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,529
happen with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also want to note</font>

1118
00:55:40,819 --> 00:55:44,450
that we will do the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the comment</font>

1119
00:55:42,529 --> 00:55:47,569
from Germany earlier that we will

1120
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:51,558
include in our answer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Australia</font>

1121
00:55:47,569 --> 00:55:57,499
and the UK input and answer to what you

1122
00:55:51,559 --> 00:56:00,319
rise today<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you so I will make a</font>

1123
00:55:57,499 --> 00:56:04,038
brief point about I gos then we can move

1124
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:06,319
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a question related to ethics and</font>

1125
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:08,989
conflict of interest in terms of i-gos

1126
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:11,390
we just wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> inform you that we are</font>

1127
00:56:08,989 --> 00:56:14,089
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this issue the issue of</font>

1128
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:16,759
protections for i-gos to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

1129
00:56:14,089 --> 00:56:19,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">are giving a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jew priority in</font>

1130
00:56:16,759 --> 00:56:22,730
consideration to protections for i-gos

1131
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:24,950
in the gac and so you may see some some

1132
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:28,519
comments coming from from the committee

1133
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:31,430
as a result of that so ethics in

1134
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:35,058
conflict of interests norway do you want

1135
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:37,549
to comment please yes Thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> You chair</font>

1136
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:43,759
and thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the opportunity to ask</font>

1137
00:56:37,549 --> 00:56:46,069
this just to just to remind about the

1138
00:56:43,759 --> 00:56:49,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">GAC advice from the Prague meeting</font>

1139
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:51,230
regarding to proceed urgently with all

1140
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:53,420
the necessary steps to implement an

1141
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:56,059
effective and enforceable ethics and

1142
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:57,460
conflict of interest policy so we

1143
00:56:56,059 --> 00:56:59,380
basically we acknowledge

1144
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:01,599
the work done<font color="#CCCCCC"> so far we also acknowledge</font>

1145
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:04,390
the response<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we got in the letters</font>

1146
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:07,660
so so so but of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course we haven't had</font>

1147
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:09,819
time to study this in in in detail but

1148
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:13,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are asking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font>

1149
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:15,280
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick comment on on the timelines for</font>

1150
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,740
the different phases described in the

1151
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:23,380
response if possible and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

1152
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:27,609
confirmation of commitment from the

1153
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:29,859
board I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for to maintain and</font>

1154
00:57:27,609 --> 00:57:34,330
keep this as a high<font color="#CCCCCC"> priority thank you</font>

1158
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:48,670
continues to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a high priority with the</font>

1159
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:50,320
board with respect to next steps at the

1160
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:54,010
last meeting in Prague we'd received

1161
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:57,040
input from a expert group which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

00:57:54,010 --> 00:58:00,550
presented publicly in Prague we're

committed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to follow their advice we</font>

1164
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:04,660
have a document before us that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1165
00:58:02,859 --> 00:58:08,380
planning<font color="#E5E5E5"> to vote on on Thursday this</font>

1166
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:10,270
week in the board meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> which picked</font>

1167
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:11,680
up their recommendation<font color="#CCCCCC"> one to collect</font>

1168
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:15,280
all the different pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

1169
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:17,368
conflicts and ethics and corporate

1170
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:20,140
governance guidelines into one document

1171
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:25,450
that is now one documents about 11 pages

1172
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:28,569
with 28 sections and it has sections

1173
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:30,939
like a summary<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our commitments with</font>

1174
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:33,670
respect to the post service limitation

1175
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:35,410
that had been enough concern to the GAC

1176
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:38,020
and other members as in what happens

1177
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:39,640
when a board member leaves the board so

1178
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:42,730
that's we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have two paragraphs on that</font>

1179
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:44,379
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving an example but that that</font>

1180
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">picks up the advice that we'd received</font>

1181
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:50,109
from that expert group as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so you'll</font>

1182
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:52,200
see that hopefully poster towards the

1183
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:55,900
end of this week assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board</font>

1184
00:58:52,200 --> 00:59:02,589
approves it at this meeting so yes we're

1185
00:58:55,900 --> 00:59:05,470
progressing as as as planned thank you

1186
00:59:02,589 --> 00:59:08,890
for that Bruce<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so next we have the</font>

1187
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:10,930
issue of<font color="#E5E5E5"> root scalability and Sweden</font>

1188
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:14,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">please</font>

1189
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:17,500
thank you very much Heather for giving

1190
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:19,720
me the floor and hello everybody in I

1191
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:22,559
can put it's always a pleasure<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

1192
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:25,480
this kind of dialogue with you it is

1193
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:28,420
interesting and very important issues

1194
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:30,700
anyway this route scalability issue is a

1195
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:32,920
favorite subject of mine but I'm going

1196
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:35,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give it a little bit a different</font>

1197
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:38,460
perspective maybe and thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all so</font>

1198
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:40,629
so so much for for the answer to our

1199
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:43,690
communicators also this issue about the

1200
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:45,430
scalability and according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what you're</font>

1201
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:48,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying is that actually you're going to</font>

1202
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:50,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">come have a new process actually that</font>

1203
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:53,890
will be defined to accommodate slowing

1204
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:56,290
down holding or reversing entries so

1205
00:59:53,890 --> 01:00:00,990
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very reassuring and you're also</font>

1206
00:59:56,290 --> 01:00:03,579
working together with the root system

1207
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:07,569
Advisory Committee which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also very</font>

1208
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:10,839
reassuring and in parallel with that we

1209
01:00:07,569 --> 01:00:14,009
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> in presentation from curt Pritz the</font>

1210
01:00:10,839 --> 01:00:18,140
other day about

1211
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:21,960
let's see here the introduction of

1212
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:24,900
actually the drawing<font color="#E5E5E5"> prioritisation is a</font>

1213
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:26,490
document called and according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1214
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:29,760
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> there in the discussion we</font>

1215
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:32,069
had which I pointed out actually is that

1216
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,710
it's more instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having a number</font>

1217
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:37,410
like we can have thousands a year and

1218
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:40,230
that's works and thousand plus 1 then<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

1219
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:42,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work that's not really</font>

1220
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:45,630
the issue is I also raised<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other day</font>

1221
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:48,660
is more like the pace and how you can

1222
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:51,060
actually adjust the pace and what Kurt

1223
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:52,410
also pointed out which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also covered</font>

1224
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:54,090
in the document and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also in the</font>

1225
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:57,149
presentation that are going to be

1226
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:58,500
xiangxi with approximately<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 20 weeks</font>

1227
01:00:57,150 --> 01:01:01,020
or something like that but but even

1228
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:03,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are figures and numbers in</font>

1229
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:06,240
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> process I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the pace is</font>

1230
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:08,790
the most important here the last issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1231
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:10,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to raise this actually that you're</font>

1232
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:13,590
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about according to what I</font>

1233
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:16,379
understand about technical evaluation

1234
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:18,720
and measurements but I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point out</font>

1235
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:20,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that i think it's equally important</font>

1236
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:23,459
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the administrative</font>

1237
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:27,630
process is whether they are kind of you

1238
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:30,210
know holding and being a secure and

1239
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:33,900
working because they're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service</font>

1240
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:38,210
level for the both existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds and the</font>

1241
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:42,180
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> TLDs we don't want the 22 to</font>

1242
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:44,220
decrease or being worse so so that is

1243
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:46,259
the administrative processes also needs

1244
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:48,959
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be measured so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1245
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:51,090
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we probably need to</font>

1246
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,680
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back with and have more dialogue</font>

1247
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:54,720
while you're working with these

1248
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:57,419
measurements and how your proceed with

1249
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:59,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it with a the important</font>

1250
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:06,000
stakeholders that you are dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1251
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:08,420
this issue thank you very much Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You</font>

1252
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,420
Sweden

1253
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:22,120
yeah is it what is the question actually

1254
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:29,230
agree with everything you said good

1255
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:31,660
point the question is that a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> boy</font>

1256
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:39,610
good boy good boy no actually that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1257
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:41,440
question is well I didn't actually have

1258
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:43,720
any question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course i had a question</font>

1259
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the question is that is are you</font>

1260
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:47,649
taking into account also the

1261
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,000
administrative processes or because i

1262
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:51,040
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really read that in either of</font>

1263
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,480
these two documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean it's more</font>

1264
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,279
like the technical issues which I of

1265
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">course think it's very important I've</font>

1266
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:57,910
been nagging about that for four years

1267
01:02:55,540 --> 01:03:00,570
now but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to know whether you</font>

1268
01:02:57,910 --> 01:03:02,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">have that in mind as well thank you so</font>

1269
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:04,570
you're asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the administrative</font>

1270
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:11,340
processes have been taken into account

1271
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:17,080
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes thank you Steve</font>

1272
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:18,460
Bruce wants to expand yeah in fact

1273
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's where we thought the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

1274
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:22,720
limitation was actually was

1275
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:24,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">administrative processes on the</font>

1276
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:27,220
technical side so that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1277
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:30,130
been the focus all along one thing I'll

1278
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:32,259
point out that the iono does actually

1279
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:35,110
publish its statistics at least on the

1280
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:37,510
other side in terms of processing so

1281
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:40,300
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually live you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually go</font>

1282
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:42,970
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> icon website and see that so I</font>

1283
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:44,620
imagine if there's any<font color="#CCCCCC"> change to you</font>

1284
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:46,930
know queue lengths for example like how

1285
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:50,230
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes to respond to a request</font>

1286
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:52,930
from either a cct or tea or<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD you'll</font>

1287
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:55,150
actually see that appearing in those you

1288
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:56,560
know public statistics so that

1289
01:03:55,150 --> 01:04:02,530
monitoring is is there today and

1290
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:06,580
available finally yeah just to clarify

1291
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:09,280
maria<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the the two things you</font>

1292
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:14,230
said are very important the first is how

1293
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:16,960
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to carefully manage the</font>

1294
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:19,240
flow and in the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> we published</font>

1295
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,610
which Kurt went over there are going to

1296
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:23,600
be three gates where we manage the flow

1297
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:27,470
we're always going to use

1298
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:29,930
the draw number to pass through these

1299
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:32,240
gates but these gates allow us to gauge

1300
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:35,419
as the applications are going through

1301
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:37,779
and avoid a situation where frankly we

1302
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:40,580
compromise the stability of the system

1303
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:43,210
just to rush things through so there's

1304
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:45,860
going to be frankly three places where

1305
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:49,100
even if people sped through a part of

1306
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:50,900
the process we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of tone</font>

1307
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:54,920
it down to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1308
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:57,680
compromise the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stability of the system I</font>

1309
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:00,320
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the administrative process yes</font>

1310
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,299
as Steve confirmed we as part of the

1311
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:04,370
evaluation of these applications we go

1312
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:06,230
quite a bit through that and i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1313
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:08,299
add even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though you may not have asked</font>

1314
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:11,240
this that also<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internal</font>

1315
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:14,450
administrative processes of I can to

1316
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:17,149
actually deal with this growth in the

1317
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:20,029
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of registries are equally</font>

1318
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:21,920
important and this is an area<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we</font>

1319
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:24,560
are putting a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of efforts right now</font>

1320
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:27,230
so we ensured that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service level we</font>

1321
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:31,130
offer to the registries and registrar's

1322
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:34,550
in this much growing and going to be

1323
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:37,520
much larger space are of the right

1324
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:39,230
service level and quality so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

1325
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:44,000
never the issue in the delivery of these

1326
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:46,340
services thank you so we have a few

<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS blocking it became even more clear</font>

1338
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:35,790
that the methods are either ineffective

1339
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:40,770
inefficient or they impact DNS SEC for

1340
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:47,009
example or alternatively they segment

1341
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:51,119
the net it's clear that probably issues

1342

having to do with unwelcome content it

1343

1345
01:06:57,869 --> 01:07:04,859
conclusion is probably that we would

01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:09,690
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> develop</font>

1349
01:07:14,609 --> 01:07:22,619
might also be an issue of globalizing a

1350

to to show that it can serve the public

before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think this new gTLDs process in</font>

1379
01:08:56,839 --> 01:09:01,160
spite of all the question that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it arises</font>

1380
01:08:58,729 --> 01:09:03,950
as would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be natural in such a complex</font>

1381
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:06,470
process I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an opportunity</font>

1382
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:10,689
for icon to to serve the public interest

1383
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:13,280
and here i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would mention two specific</font>

1384
01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:16,250
measures that could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> going tandem that</font>

1385
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:19,279
could address this dis opportunity to

1386
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:21,589
serve the global public interest as has

1387
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:24,139
already been mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean if the</font>

1388
01:09:21,589 --> 01:09:28,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">gTLDs sponsored or supported by</font>

1389
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:31,810
government could sort of be prioritized

1390
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:38,540
and end at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time if we could</font>

1391
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:40,460
achieve a more global balance of the sig

1392
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:43,670
nations since we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

1393
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:46,760
lesser requests from countries from

1394
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:49,520
Africa from Latin America and from the

1395
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:52,900
Pacific so probably we could achieve

1396
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:56,270
balance if he could have these regions

1397
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:58,910
sort of also being prioritized in within
