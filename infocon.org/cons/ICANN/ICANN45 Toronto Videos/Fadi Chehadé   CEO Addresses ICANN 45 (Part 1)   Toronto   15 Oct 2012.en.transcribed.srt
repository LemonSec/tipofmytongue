to these things and keep working as hard

36

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,649
girl who decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write a blog in Urdu</font>

38
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:06,539
to keep her school open today she's

39
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,399
battling for her life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we just found</font>

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,340
UK this morning for treatment and she's

42
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:17,489
while we're sitting here

43
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:19,799
enabling the continuity of this medium

44
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:22,769
that allowed her to speak her mind I

45
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:26,340
asked us all to keep her in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our thoughts</font>

46
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:28,950
I for sure will offer my week my

happens this week for her to be better

49
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,629
and to get well but let's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget</font>

50
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:43,019
that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we do this at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

51
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:45,929
of the day this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why we do this a new</font>

52
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:48,060
season indeed there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot on my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font>

53
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,180
and I spent as I told you the summer

54
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:55,139
listening let me tell you what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard</font>

55
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:58,590
first and remarkably lots of good will

56
00:02:55,139 --> 00:03:01,049
from all of you my goodness I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

57
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,239
started any endeavor before where

58
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:06,060
everyone I talked to says how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we</font>

59
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,889
help you how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we make this better yes</font>

60
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,549
it's all broken there's all these issues

61
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:14,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">but how can we help you the pent up</font>

62
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:18,299
goodwill for I can is I cans biggest

63
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,608
capital and next to that it's our people

64
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,650
it's all of us the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that make this</font>

65
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:25,229
happen that's what makes this possible

66
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,290
so the goodwill and the people behind

67
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:31,609
this is what makes I can possible and

68
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:35,448
what makes our mission really worthwhile

69
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:38,989
that I heard plenty of in the summer

70
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:44,489
equally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also heard many other things I</font>

71
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:46,739
heard that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on the way we</font>

72
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,840
deliver things that I can that there is

73
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:53,689
much to be desired to improve our

74
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:58,229
operational excellence I heard also that

75
00:03:53,689 --> 00:04:00,000
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> very us centric and you know i'm</font>

76
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:04,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to continue apologizing about</font>

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,359
this the internet started in the US but

78
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:09,659
now it's time for it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> truly be the</font>

79
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:11,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">world's and we will make that happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

80
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,138
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apologize for where</font>

81
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,840
this came from when we see people like

82
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:18,418
dr. Crocker and dr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> Postel and Vint Cerf</font>

83
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,340
we understand that these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people did</font>

84
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:23,279
something great and gifted it to all of

85
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:26,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">us but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's incumbent upon us to</font>

86
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:29,669
take it to the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they gave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

87
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:34,050
but we are to Center q eccentric today

88
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:35,818
and I can in our decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> making I just</font>

89
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,740
realized this summer for example that

90
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:41,699
not all stakeholders on the planet

91
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:44,039
happen to be in LA we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> invite</font>

92
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,780
them all to LA but it's crowded enough

93
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:50,250
right now that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's best we go</font>

94
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:52,739
to them so I can need to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world</font>

95
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,110
needs to get closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to its stakeholders</font>

96
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,120
we cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell the world that we're</font>

97
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,250
close to our stakeholders<font color="#E5E5E5"> when all the</font>

98
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,380
decisions and all the staff is sitting

99
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:05,250
in Los Angeles that doesn't work and we

100
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:08,219
will fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the other thing I heard</font>

101
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:11,280
this summer is that our communications

102
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,800
are not up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sniff we do everything we</font>

103
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,960
can we communicate a lot we engage as

104
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,120
much as we can but it's not enough and

105
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,400
frankly when I saw the amount of effort

106
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,289
being put on engaging and communicating

107
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,460
it's actually tremendous amount of

108
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:27,810
effort but what we're missing is a plan

109
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:31,109
what we're missing is putting it all

110
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:37,340
together in a structured way so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

111
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:41,310
can engage with all equally locally in

112
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:44,190
ways people understand this is very

113
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">important it's not about announcing that</font>

114
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,780
I'm opening a new office in<font color="#E5E5E5"> New Delhi</font>

115
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,539
that's not what it what that is about

116
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,179
what it's about is to understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

117
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:56,669
we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> engage with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the people of</font>

118
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">India for example and bring them into</font>

119
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:01,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fold that's what it's about and</font>

120
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:06,508
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the listening that we did the</font>

121
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,880
summer yields me to this you the

122
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:11,520
community and our board which is part of

123
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,310
our community put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together a three-year</font>

124
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,430
strategic plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> that plan is available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

125
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:20,729
the web I read it multiple times I

126
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:23,039
understand it then from that plan you

127
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:24,719
develop a yearly operating plan or

128
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,289
operations plan and a budget to support

129
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:33,060
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also read that and I kind of</font>

130
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:35,880
understand it it but it's there we have

131
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,190
an Operations plan but i<font color="#E5E5E5"> am going to</font>

132
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,630
base my work in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next few months on</font>

133
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,270
these plans

134
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,400
it is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> my role or my job to do</font>

135
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:47,760
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> but to put the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work you've</font>

136
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:51,440
asked us to do to work and so I'm

137
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:55,469
creating a management delivery set of

138
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,590
objectives a management delivery set of

139
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:01,320
goals and then to support these i'm

140
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,530
going to create a system and a structure

141
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:07,409
and a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tools to make it all happen</font>

142
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:09,479
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to show you this this is</font>

143
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,210
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have in mind i'm spending the</font>

144
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,000
whole week here pretty much booked from

145
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:17,340
six to midnight every day but we have

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,440
time between midnight and six you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

147
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,929
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can talk to me you can give me input</font>

148
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,930
I'm very very open to listening and

149
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:28,410
adjusting this but let me say something

150
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:31,560
once we move we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to move there</font>

151
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:34,680
is no time for hiccups here and there is

152
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,540
no time for backtracking so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me share</font>

153
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">with you what I have on the management</font>

154
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:43,650
delivery first let me talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

155
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:46,679
objectives listening to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you I</font>

156
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:49,020
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with these four key objectives</font>

157
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,180
the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we need to do</font>

158
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,180
things to continue affirming the purpose

159
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,920
of I can secondly we must get to

160
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,430
operations excellence and I spoke about

161
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:03,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">this in Prague thirdly we have to</font>

162
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:06,300
internationalize I can and lastly we

163
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:10,229
must evolve this multi-stakeholder model

164
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:13,320
so it keeps working for us the

165
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:16,440
multi-stakeholder model is designed to

166
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:19,140
evolve not to stand still if it stands

167
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,210
still too long it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break we</font>

168
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,610
have an expanding community we have

169
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:26,159
expanding work to do and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

170
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that model works for us now let me</font>

171
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,850
break these objectives down for you and

172
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,590
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to take a little time but</font>

173
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,659
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very important set of messages</font>

174
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:36,120
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to share</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with you and I want</font>

175
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,829
your feedback on in the days ahead what

176
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,770
do I mean by affirmation of purpose

177
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,960
we've designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> four goals under that the</font>

178
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,240
first is to continue delivering with

179
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,089
excellence our core internet functions

180
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,699
which are well defined and<font color="#E5E5E5"> our bylaws in</font>

181
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:54,850
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> mission and we all understand</font>

182
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:58,209
secondly we must act as a steward of the

183
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:00,930
public interest we must have the courage

184
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:05,008
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> stand up for the public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interest and</font>

185
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:09,040
do it consistently not symbolically in

186
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:12,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">reality in how we do our work thirdly we</font>

187
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,579
cannot remain a fortress we cannot say

188
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,529
we do our thing here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> walls good</font>

189
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:19,989
luck getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and we're protecting</font>

190
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:22,720
ourselves no we must engage in the

191
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:26,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet governance ecosystem we have</font>

192
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,300
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very proud of we must go</font>

193
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:31,779
out and tell the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what a great</font>

194
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:34,800
thing this model is and engage<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

195
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:38,110
whole internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> governance ecosystem and</font>

196
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,689
lastly we must deepen our partnerships

197
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,540
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet organizations</font>

198
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:48,849
that work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us we must work closer</font>

199
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:52,149
with them i sock<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF the w3c the rirs</font>

200
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:55,240
all these great organizations that make

201
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:57,759
up this fantastic canvas that makes us

202
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,410
all this work we must deepen our

203
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:05,740
partnerships with them and we already

204
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:10,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">started doing so I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this next goal</font>

205
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:12,639
is where my experience comes we must

206
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:16,959
raise the level of operations excellence

207
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:19,749
that I can we will not scale without

208
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,439
this we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not do our basic work</font>

209
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:24,870
without us so first we must

210
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:28,480
institutionalize management disciplines

211
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:31,660
we must put<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in place across</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

212
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,339
it's not an art every time we don't

213
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,819
create every process every time we

214
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:39,059
started we have to put in place standard

215
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:41,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">operating mechanisms and then</font>

216
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:45,189
institutionalize them across I can

217
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:47,049
secondly we must mature the

218
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:51,819
organizational functions that support us

219
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:55,119
we cannot continue functioning like a

220
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:57,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">start-up we have to have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> backend</font>

221
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:59,559
organizational functions that make the

222
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:02,529
great team that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can and the great</font>

223
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:03,780
community around it all of us function

224
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:07,630
more effectively

225
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:09,459
thirdly we must optimize our services to

226
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the growing number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of registries and</font>

227
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:16,300
registrar's they come to I can to get

228
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:19,510
their business done it is our job<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

229
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,040
their work done for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that needs</font>

230
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:25,510
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be raised to a new level of</font>

231
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:30,760
excellence and lastly we must plan for

232
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:33,580
scale securely and for continuity no

233
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,819
organization that is expected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow</font>

234
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:40,660
and to serve with the discipline we plan

235
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:43,480
to make I can work without a plan for

236
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:48,569
continuity and scale and certainly all

237
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:51,490
in a very secure way our third objective

238
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:53,440
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> internationalize is probably the one</font>

239
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:57,040
you all discussed the most in the last

240
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,570
few years and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board asked me</font>

241
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:04,480
what is your internationalization

242
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:05,950
strategy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have one I think</font>

243
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,720
if we do an internationalization

244
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:12,490
strategy we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already externalize the job</font>

245
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,880
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do from the bottom up must</font>

246
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:19,180
be international every department we

247
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:22,510
have must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be assigned to look after the</font>

248
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,859
world it must get into our DNA if it

249
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,900
doesn't we're going to have some

250
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,540
separate plan to be international

251
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,550
outside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our normal plan and I've seen</font>

252
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,800
this happen I've worked in major

253
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:35,560
multinational organizations where the

254
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,689
first way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> internationalize is to send</font>

255
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,270
people put them out on posts and wait

256
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:43,240
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicates it doesn't work</font>

257
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:45,250
this way anymore all successful

258
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,790
international organizations have

259
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:52,030
completely taken all their departmental

260
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,860
teams and flip them upside down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font>

261
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:56,020
them completely matrix than global

262
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the only way this will happen and</font>

263
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll share this with you in a little</font>

264
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:04,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">more detail in the next slides and so</font>

265
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:06,099
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came up a lot the summer</font>

266
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:09,010
how could you claim you're going to

267
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:13,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">internationalize given the intricacy of</font>

268
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:17,200
all your government relationships so yes

269
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,540
I acknowledge that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a central part</font>

270
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">our plan to internationalize has got to</font>

271
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:26,530
be evolving our government relationships

272
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:29,350
and we will do this Conley we will do

273
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:33,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">this with care and we will do it</font>

274
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:35,380
deliberately there is no rush here we

275
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,320
are working fine but we need to

276
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,030
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this has to evolve and I</font>

277
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,330
think all the government's we're working

278
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:45,459
with today and the last this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my 40th</font>

279
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,410
day here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last few few days have</font>

280
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,620
been here all the government's I met

281
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:56,290
with are very supportive of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us evolving</font>

282
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:59,130
into this position this last objective

283
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:01,870
is an important<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and it's not last</font>

284
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,570
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's least important but because</font>

285
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:07,330
it's the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe is the most</font>

286
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:09,880
medium to long-term objective for us we

287
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:12,760
must evolve this model by optimizing our

288
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,850
policy development processes I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:18,550
many of you here say it's working<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

290
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,140
frankly many of you say we could make

291
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,959
the policy development process<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

292
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,180
better we must evolve this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and optimize</font>

293
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,520
them people need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come to I can and</font>

294
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:32,349
get their policies done in an effective

295
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:34,829
way secondly we must increase and

296
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:39,390
improve the participation and I can I

297
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:44,050
heard all summer participant fatigue

298

people tired lots of work lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours</font>

299
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,579
we cannot sustain this this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way</font>

300
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,460
for I can to grow so we have to

301
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:53,800
absolutely increase the number of

302
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">participants but also improve give them</font>

304
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:02,230

307
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,100
need to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at them we need to evolve</font>

308
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:15,250
them we need to work to see do these

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:17,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">cover all the stakeholders what else do</font>

310
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,270
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we evolve them and</font>

311
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:22,449
make them better together we should be

312
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:25,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">open to this and understand that the</font>

ground is now shifting and moving to a

new I can to a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> season and we must</font>

315
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,209
look at all these things critically but

316
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:35,740
calmly

317
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:38,410
so that we can do the right thing now

318
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,839
this final point is one that I brought

319
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:44,050
up in Prague and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring it up</font>

320

again here none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this will be possible</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">if it's not done in a framework of true</font>

ethical standards that we live by that

323
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,740
we don't just put on a nice little chart

324
00:15:55,449 --> 00:16:01,889
and check that we all live by and I know

325
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:04,569
that our board<font color="#E5E5E5"> of director has risen</font>

352
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,929
effort that started quietly in Prague

353
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:28,120
but then grew and became a public

354
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:31,539
success today that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to share with</font>

355
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:34,840
you in Prague I had the privilege to

356
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:36,820
meet with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the African delegates all the</font>

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,330
people coming here from the continent of

Africa

359
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:51,350
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was special</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for me because I'm</font>

361
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:57,860
from Egypt and I looked at them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

362
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:01,700
saw how long it's been before they felt

363
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:04,370
they were included<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the process and we</font>

364
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:07,279
shared immediately the agreement<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

365
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:11,120
will engage to take Africa to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

366
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:13,940
stage it's time and they rose to the

367
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,100
challenge so I I want them to stand

368
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:19,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now because what they did they</font>

00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:30,590
multi-stakeholder models should work it

374
