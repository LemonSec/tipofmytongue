no real clue that we were laying down

149
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,780
the foundations for today's internet

150
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:12,740
Engineering Task Force and later the

151
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:16,820
foundation for I can aside from my job

152
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:20,330
of welcoming you today the other key

153
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:24,830
thing I have to do is tell you how happy

154
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:30,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are with the arrival of fadi chehade</font>

155
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:33,650
in role of president and CEO we worked

156
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:36,500
for a the board worked very hard over

157
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:39,469
the past year in a search process and

158
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,770
equally hard in the less visible but

159
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:47,000
nonetheless quite vigorous transition

160
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:50,090
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fadi outdid himself and what I</font>

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,660
know was a very high stress period for

162
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:56,479
him things were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going quite well for him</font>

00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:59,180
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the job that he had and it it</font>

164
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:03,290
took quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work to extricate</font>

165
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:06,080
himself from that and he advertised that

166
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:08,120
it would take him until the beginning of

167
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,200
this month he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to accelerate</font>

168
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,910
that but far more impressive to those of

169
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,610
us who were watching closely is that in

170
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,290
that time when he was said he might have

171
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,750
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of time to pay attention to</font>

172
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:23,540
I can while he was in transition he

173
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,760
studied very hard studied deeply spent

174
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:30,530
quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more time than he advertised</font>

175
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:33,860
and immediately grabbed hold of several

176
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:36,770
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hard problems and so when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

177
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,909
started he was on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> very day on that</font>

178
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:42,000
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> morning able to introduce</font>

179
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:46,350
a couple of very important key hires who

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear about a bit of reorganization and</font>

technical and other kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems</font>

190
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:20,130
exudes a tremendous amount of comfort

working to gradually improve our

series of relatively small things as

opposed to some grand set of changes and

it's it's it's basically working we're

tightening up on our board meetings

in the past our board meetings have

cranked on two<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours scheduled three</font>

on demand nice idea didn't work very

233
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:28,339
well I had not realized the consequences

234
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:30,319
of everybody having previously tried to

235

they're not to do they're not supposed

246
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:04,720
to be the primary activity where matters

247
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:07,190
subject matters are delved into we're

248

we're charged with overseeing the

process making sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the pieces</font>

have come together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and are proper but I</font>

251
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:24,410
will say we overdid it a bit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prague</font>

252
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:27,500
we passed the calm and a renewal the

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,449
renewal for the.com registry and we

254
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,300
passed the budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we did that on</font>

255
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:36,800
Saturday when we were meeting in sort of

256
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:38,630
workshop mode and received substantial

257
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,740
complaints about why did we do that

258
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:46,339
privately instead of in public and so

259
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:48,199
I'm here to say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I apologized we set</font>

00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:52,010
the threshold in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrong place we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">won't do that anymore nonetheless having</font>

said that and being totally committed to

00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,910
putting these kinds of decisions in view

264
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,729
where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see them happen I want to</font>

265
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:03,360
set your expectations properly this is

266
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,940
as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said board meetings are not</font>

267
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,459
going to be the place<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you see new</font>

269
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:14,819
debates there may well be differences of

270
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:18,029
opinion among board members we will give

271
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:20,130
a absolutely open voice to board members

272
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:23,790
to speak their minds put on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the record</font>

any any opinions but the formation of

those opinions and the debates back and

275
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,440
forth have to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> place in a more</font>

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,170
orderly way in a more timely way over a

277
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,329
period of time through public comment

278
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:39,569
through open sessions during the

279
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:41,430
meetings and through the policy

280
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:44,940
development processes of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

the supporting organizations and with

advice from the advisory committees so

by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time a resolution comes to the</font>

highly visible decisions in front and

287
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,920
you'll see them but as I say the

288
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,410
expectations should be set that what

289
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,689
you're seeing is the end result of a

long<font color="#E5E5E5"> process not a primary process in</font>

296
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:36,240
practice last time of trying to record

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,949
what we've heard and then tell you what

298

we've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell you what we plan to</font>

00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:45,390

300
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:48,720
with the the expected follow through on

301

a sequence like that we come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back the</font>

00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,399
do since the last time but<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font>

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,170
the public forum will just be beginning

320
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:37,450
at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we will publish</font>

321
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:39,880
shortly after this meeting the package

00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:44,230
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I said what we've heard and what</font>

323
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:46,420
we plan to do about it we are eager for

324
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:50,350
feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that process the whole point</font>

325
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:55,810
of it is to improve communication and so

326
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:58,780
we expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of communication let</font>

327
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:02,500
me cover two other things and and then

328
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:04,030
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be pretty much done with me we</font>

329
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,440
take the reviews required by the

330
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,930
affirmation of commitments very

331
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,330
seriously we're in the late stages of

332
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,099
implementing the 27 recommendations from

333
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:15,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the accountability and transparency</font>

334
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:19,090
review we've also received reports from

335
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:21,819
the next two reviews for who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and for</font>

336
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:23,740
security stability and resiliency we're

337
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,350
now examining these reports carefully

338
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,390
the process is not as visible as I would

339
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,790
like it to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let me tell you just a</font>

340
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:33,220
bit about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it one of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

341
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:36,849
after we receive these reports is we ask

342
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:40,300
the staff for an assessment an objective

343
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:41,920
assessment of feasibility cost and where

344
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,410
the implementation would take place who

345
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,050
would be responsible for it if we accept

346
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the recommendation we want to know for</font>

sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get done we also</font>

348
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,280
want to reach out to the relevant

349
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,380
parties to understand what the impact is

350
00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:01,300
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be and to the relevant subject</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know before we go forward with the</font>

353
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:08,290
decision we give great weight as we

354
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,530
should to the recommendations in the

355
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:15,700
report we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't treat them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as casual or</font>

356
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:17,589
just advice from another party and we

357
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,630
also look very seriously at how to move

358
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:21,889
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll say more about this</font>

359
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:26,570
formally during the public board meeting

360
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:29,570
on Thursday<font color="#E5E5E5"> and over time I expect to</font>

361
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:32,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">document the full cycle of what the</font>

362
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:35,689
review processes are not just the very

363
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:39,590
heavy work that's done by the review

364
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:43,820
committees themselves let me do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> let</font>

365
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:47,260
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> take up the the last matter you have</font>

one of our Ombudsman Chris lahat and we

have another picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> herb way our</font>

adjunct Ombudsman they're available in

dockside for all week fatty will mention

371
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:06,140
them again my<font color="#CCCCCC"> purpose here is to</font>

372
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,970
emphasize something that we've

373
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,820
discovered in reviewing the process

374
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,950
which is nobody has used the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ombudsman</font>

375
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,270
to complain about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board they use</font>

376
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,620
other methods to complain about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

377
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,870
board we get plenty of complaints all

378
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,389
right but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to highlight that</font>

379
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:23,179
among the various methods that are

380
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:26,630
available for communicating the

381
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:29,150
Ombudsman process is open-ended

382
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:32,600
available for all purposes and in some

383
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:34,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">ways more flexible than asking for a</font>

384
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:39,370
reconsideration motion which has very

385
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:39,370
narrow parameters so give it a try
