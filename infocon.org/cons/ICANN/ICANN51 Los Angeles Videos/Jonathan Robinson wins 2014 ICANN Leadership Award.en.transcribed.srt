recognition of the value of

92
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,770
organs of a body and the organs need to

93
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,500
function healthily and well but the body

94
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:03,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a whole also needs to work and</font>

any accusation that we might live it

105
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,860
should go that the work should go
