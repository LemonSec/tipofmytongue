2014 which for those of you who are new

our fiscal year starts on july first and

63

just ended on june thirtieth of this

64
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,350
year now<font color="#E5E5E5"> during this fiscal year we had</font>

65
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,450
many historic milestones of course the

66
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,940
most important one that everyone is

67
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:28,000
talking about is the decision of the US

68
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,250
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> to transition the stewardship</font>

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,989
they've had of the IANA functions to our

70
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,330
community and you heard secretary

71
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:37,269
Pritzker today with great eloquence

72
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:40,060
speak about the importance of this

73
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:42,760
transition and the commitment the US

74
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">government has had to support I can and</font>

75
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:49,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the commitment they will keep do I can</font>

76
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:51,310
and to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet governed the way we</font>

77
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,530
all wanted to be governed

78
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,770
in a multi-stakeholder way and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

79
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:59,680
recognize at this moment one of the

80
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,780
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we talked about all of us in</font>

81
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,650
the hallways and in emails and in many

82
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,870
discussions but rarely frankly publicly

83
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,300
thanked for his incredible leadership

84
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:14,880
and that's Assistant Secretary Larry

85
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,880
Strickling who's here with us today

86
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,889
we re with his<font color="#E5E5E5"> able team including fee</font>

87
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:33,900
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alexander who's here as you all know</font>

88
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:36,060
her are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the quiet champions of</font>

89
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,599
this transition they're the people who

90
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:43,199
trust us and who have brought together a

91
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:46,169
difficult but important coalition to

92
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,889
support this transition this is not easy

93
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:52,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do many governments ask me why would</font>

94
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:55,319
the u.s. government give up this why

95
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,020
would any government give up our it's

96
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,560
not natural but through the courage and

97
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">leadership of Larry and his team and</font>

98
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,819
secretary Pritzker support and our

99
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,710
president support here in the US I think

100
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:09,539
we're moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> direction so</font>

101
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">we thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that very important</font>

102
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:15,599
milestone and now it's incumbent upon us

103
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:17,729
to take this huge responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

104
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:20,430
being handed and to carry through and

105
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:23,190
get this done however that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't the</font>

106
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,849
only thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened in 2014 so let</font>

107
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:29,879
me cover a few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you recall we</font>

108
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:32,370
have a strategic<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan and a framework</font>

109
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,860
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> includes four objectives that we</font>

110
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:38,520
identified in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Toronto meeting back</font>

111
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:41,099
in 2012 when I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> and these are the</font>

112
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,448
four let me show you what we've done in

113
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:47,190
2014 on each of these four first

114
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:48,990
affirmation of our purpose and here

115
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,900
there are many numbers and facts let me

116
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,819
focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple as you know we have a</font>

117
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">very active group of community members</font>

118
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:59,759
that do the accountability

119
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,759
recommendations that team gave us a key

120
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,839
recommendation to create better access

121
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:10,379
to who is information and so in 2014 we

122
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:12,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">introduced who is doc I can org if you</font>

131
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,800
filled an important void within that

132
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:40,980
tool in April we added consolidated<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

create expert networks within our

community so for those of you who

303
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:36,480
haven't done so yet please do build your

304

profiles this is to help us be together

305
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,230
and work better as a team I also think

306
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:45,260
on the translation side<font color="#E5E5E5"> once the number</font>

307
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,660
of words we've translated has grown

00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:51,660
exponentially in 2014 reflecting the

00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,290
localization localization is much more

00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:16,470
share this with my friends at places

381
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:19,320
like IBM and I say we spent 17 months

382
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:23,430
writing the new strategic plan they

383

don't understand I didn't understand but

384
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:30,060
now I do that unless we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this together</font>

385
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:32,820
from the bottom up it is not our plan it

00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:36,060
may be my plan it may be the staffs plan

387
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:38,520
it may be somebody's idea but the genius

388
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:42,060
of ICANN the magic of I can is that we

five strategic objectives here they are

now we used to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> four as I showed you</font>

405
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:34,560
before we now have a fifth one the four

00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:37,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">are changed but somewhat similar the</font>

407

and one frankly that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm i am and i'm</font>

together and you will find it on our

operating plan and budget process and

00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:44,530
then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> here we go to achievement and</font>

460
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:10,150
everyone's input we need you please help

461
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">us with this because this is the</font>

462
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,470
foundation for how we build the yearly

00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,360
plans after

464
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,860
that and then we'll do the yearly plan

465
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,750
every year and as usual we'll work with

466
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:20,149
you on it and then we'll do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,860
achievement and progress reporting let

468
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:27,830
me dwell for a minute on the achievement

469
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:30,678
and progress reporting remarkably we do

470
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:34,129
not have as a community common agreement

471
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:38,570
on a scorecard of key performance

472
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:41,330
indicators we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so when people</font>

473
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:44,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">come up to me and say Phi the operations</font>

474
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:46,189
are not quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> there well how much</font>

475
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,539
farther do we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go well we don't</font>

476
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,539
know because we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an agreement</font>

477
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:53,179
on what are the frameworks so in this

478
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:55,158
operating plan and the annual plan we're

479
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:58,309
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be inserting for the first time</font>

480
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:00,470
a complete framework of key performance

481
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:03,379
indicators and then we will measure

482
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:06,770
these continuously and we will share all

483
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,870
the data with you continuously so when

484
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:11,210
we have discussions we are a line on

485
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:13,668
what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to serve you in the</font>

best possible way now these creepy eyes

487
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:17,720
are critical and I'm looking at many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

you here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:28,189
performance indicators for you now we're

list of many i can meetings we will do

495
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,340
like most corporations do they hold

00:23:55,909 --> 00:24:01,280
full information on our performance

financial and business and strategic and

505
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,840

so please join<font color="#CCCCCC"> us for these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this will be</font>

understanding the openness and

00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:21,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">transparency with which I can operate so</font>

512
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,810
the first call will be in

515
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,290
little more detail on what's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

516
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,939
three components it's important to

517
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:37,430
appreciate this because many of these

518
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,560
things are new i can has never had a

519
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:42,020
five-year operating plan this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

520
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,720
first time we do this but the strategic

521
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:47,270
plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course includes our vision</font>

522
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:50,240
listen the far the five strategic

523
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:52,580
objectives and the 16 goals and of

524
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,400
course we have some strategic risks also

525
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:58,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">outlined in that document when we go to</font>

526
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,800
the five-year operating plan for each of

527
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:04,010
the goals we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key performance</font>

528
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:06,710
indicators the risks the dependencies

529
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:09,200
and for the first time the five-year

530
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:11,660
phasing in other words what do we expect

531
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,940
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do on this goal in a year in two</font>

532
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,190
years in three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on and so</font>

533
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:19,160
forth so you have a view of where we're

534
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:21,620
heading with each of these goals then we

535
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,800
will list every portfolio of work we're

536
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:27,949
doing under each<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal and there are</font>

537
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,840
today about 50-60 portfolios of work we

538
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:32,840
will fit them now under these five goals

539
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,179
so you see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can is doing in each</font>

540
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,560
of these areas the other thing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

541
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,050
put in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> five-year plan which we've</font>

542
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,870
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> done before is a five-year</font>

543
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:45,290
financial model this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the first time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

544
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:47,570
can will publish what its viewers of the

545
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:49,360
revenues the top line as well as the

546
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:52,600
expenses<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the next five years and</font>

547
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:55,820
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is important so you we are</font>

548
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:58,820
completely aligned with as a community

549
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,620
as to what is our financial view for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

550
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,780
next five years and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally the</font>

551
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,520
operating plan will go further it will

552
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">have it will base itself on the</font>

553
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,129
five-year operating plan the annual plan

554
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:12,440
will also<font color="#CCCCCC"> include for each portfolio the</font>

555
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,660
kpi's the dependencies and all the

556
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,310
activities under that and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

557
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,380
because it has a budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

558
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:20,389
numbers so you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to see how</font>

559
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:24,500
much we're spending on each of these

560
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:27,650
areas very important work and believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

561
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,690
there are very few organizations that

562
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:31,470
are functioning with this openness and

563
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,990
with this transparency

564
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:35,760
and with this commitment to operational

565
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:41,280
excellence of an entire community

566
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:46,190
working together finally I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to share</font>

567
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">with you a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very important new direction</font>

568
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:52,890
as my boss Steve Crocker said in his

569
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:55,700
opening it just seemed in the last 23

570
00:26:52,890 --> 00:27:00,419
years that I can was growing without

571
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:02,610
limit we would like to start painting

572
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:06,480
that growth we would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

573
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:09,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I can stays within its remit and to</font>

574
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,120
do so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to set up a baseline</font>

575
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,250
operational model these baseline

576
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:19,110

year based on normal year to year CPI

578
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:25,260
and other indicators so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will not be</font>

581
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:35,820
as a community asset decide how much it

00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:39,240
will cost us decide how it will impact

our organization our priorities and if

00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:45,240
we choose to do it we will spend the

00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:47,460
money on it and if at the end of that it

586
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,880
leaves some residual work in the

the whole process to add new initiatives

591

will be ready and published so that you

00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:15,240
couple of years it seemed that staff

would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be adding new initiatives that we</font>

called contractual compliance and

611
00:28:54,660 --> 00:29:00,480
consumer safeguards will be headed by a

00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:39,360
important because we are choosing to

move into Alan's new area contract

671
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:52,200
missioned finally I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

what we're all talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US</font>

government transition that is undertaken

674
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:03,418
this transition has today for tracks two

675
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:06,649
tracks the main tracks are community-led

676
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:08,999
tracks the first one as you know is to

677
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:12,238
work together on how we're going to

678
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:15,749
transition the specific iono functions

679
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:17,909
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can from the current regime where</font>

680
00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:20,820
the US government<font color="#CCCCCC"> has applied some</font>

00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:23,820
stewardship in the past the second part

682
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:26,279
is to strengthen<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICANN's governments and</font>

683
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:29,220
accountability now this has been on

684
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:30,840
everybody's discussion list we need to

685
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,139
improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICANN's governance and</font>

686
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,709
accountability and the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that is</font>

687
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:39,209
absolutely we must and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

688
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,859
strive to improve our governance and

689
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:43,710
accountability at all times and

690
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:47,580
especially this time we will not gain

691
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:50,489
and maintain the confidence of the world

possible governance and accountability

695
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:01,559
mechanisms there are so wise we had some

696
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:02,559
discussion for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last few months how</font>

697

<font color="#E5E5E5">to organize this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I think all of us would agree that today</font>

699
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:09,428
we are completely aligned we know where

we're going and we'll move forward

701

together to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> building these</font>

00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:18,159
accountability measures be within the

703
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:23,249
second track we have also<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreed to have</font>

704
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:27,519
two parallel efforts one to deal with

705
00:33:23,249 --> 00:33:31,779
accountability mechanisms that must be

706
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,940
reinforced or added before the

707
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:35,519
transition occurs or alone with the

708
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">transition and this is something</font>

709
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,559
assistant secretary strictly made clear

710
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:44,879
in his speech in Istanbul that he will

711
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:48,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for community consensus</font>

712
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:51,639
community consensus on how we improve

713
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:54,429
our accountability with regards

714
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:56,709
specifically to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition and then</font>

715
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:59,740
in parallel another group because we are

716
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:02,379
also receiving these requests needs to

717
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:05,110
look at the broader I can accountability

718
00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:06,820
and governance improvements that we need

719
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:11,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that may not need to be</font>

00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:13,599
necessarily taken care of before a

721
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:16,290
transition occurs so by creating this

722
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,669
two parallel efforts that are

723
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:21,460
intricately tied but on different

724
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:23,799
timelines we satisfy the needs of the

725
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,599
global community and our community to

726
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,450
