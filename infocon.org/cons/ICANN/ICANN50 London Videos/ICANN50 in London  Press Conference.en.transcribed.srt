make a likeness with IDG News Service I

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:09,849
was wanting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to comment on the statements</font>

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,860
made by the french minister in financial

4
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:14,590
times this morning sir saying that the

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:17,380
icon is totally opaque and also

00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:20,380
suggesting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> General Assembly which she</font>

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:26,289
reiterated during the session this

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:29,710
morning that's it thank ya I I think

9
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:32,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">that France along with all countries</font>

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:35,020
that have benefited hugely from the

11
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:40,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">openness of the Internet would like to</font>

continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see I can evolve and grow so</font>

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,059
we support absolutely support that I

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,829
think everyone that has seen our actions

15
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:54,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing speak for that if</font>

16
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:58,120
she or others have ideas to create new

17
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:00,039
structures to enable<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can to improve by</font>

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,410
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> means let's put these ideas on the</font>

19
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:06,640
table we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> open mechanisms to do that</font>

20
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:09,970
anyone can participate and let's debate

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,600
them and if indeed we all agree by

22
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,939
consensus with a diverse participation

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,548
of all stakeholders not just governments

24
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:22,270
but everyone that this is the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

25
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:25,720
I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should go so I think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact</font>

26
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:29,619
that any government including Frances

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:32,140
puts on the table good ideas any ideas

28
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:34,900
it's our responsibility to consume them

29
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,790
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to them and to advance i can</font>

30
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,220
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if i can doesn't advance we're</font>

31
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,110
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to die we have to have to progress</font>

32
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,240
all the time we have for the last 15

33
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">years we're not about to stop so we</font>

34
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:50,079
welcome we welcome any effort to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go that</font>

35
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:52,060
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> now i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

36
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,648
Transparency International when they

37
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,060
sent a team to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> us they said</font>

38
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:57,009
you're one of the hardest-working

39
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,040
organizations on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the planet to be</font>

40
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:01,390
transparent so and we are and the

41
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,689
assessment is that we are quite

42
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:07,330
transparent so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will continue</font>

43
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:09,970
to do that transparency account

44
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:12,670
ability as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said this morning are like</font>

45
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,950
perfection you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to keep</font>

46
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,049
working at them you can never stop and i

47
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:21,220
can has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been working very very hard on</font>

48
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:24,880
these issues and we will continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to is</font>

49
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:26,620
the dot wine celsius so serious for them

50
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,450
that they feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the whole line can</font>

51
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,160
has to be rebuilt for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what</font>

52
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:34,540
happened the way they<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted or sir</font>

53
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,790
what's what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they after you think I I</font>

54
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:41,079
don't know it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask them I mean</font>

55
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:43,780
wine is serious we all like wine so

56
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,360
there's no no issue with with the fact

57
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,060
that wine is a very serious matter it is

58
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,250
obviously also a major industry for

59
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,700
France and however<font color="#E5E5E5"> for other parts of</font>

60
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:58,630
the world many many countries<font color="#CCCCCC"> have wine</font>

61
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:03,040
industries as well I think that their

62
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:05,019
concern about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld and others gTLDs</font>

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,959
is warranted and there are mechanisms

64
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,550
that I can for them to pursue and they

65
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,900
have pursued them and they should

66
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,350
continue pursuing there are additional

67
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,590
mechanisms they have so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

68
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,570
good thing I mean I understand we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

69
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:23,170
get frustrated sometimes when we don't

70
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:25,180
get the conclusions we want but more

71
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,609
importantly is to continue working

72
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,220
through a process that has worked for

73
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,380
many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> for many years and to</font>

74
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:36,850
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet economy and</font>

75
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:38,950
the new gTLDs have created a huge

76
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,739
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is serving a lot of people</font>

77
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,510
and building a lot of value let's keep

78
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:46,690
focused on that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we will all</font>

79
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:49,359

80
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,760
Germany on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition coordination</font>

81
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,700
group there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> calls to change</font>

82
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,440
the composition I'm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example in</font>

83
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:01,030
the government advisory committee how

84
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:04,209
will these be noble changes be made who

85
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,560
will decide on that and when what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

86
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:08,380
timeline for that and the second

87
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,850
question is it conceivable that that

88
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,370
might be a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve I don't</font>

89
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:15,609
know is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> conceivable that the</font>

90
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:19,060
oversight part if you call if you call

91
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:21,130
it oversight is broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> up because in the</font>

92
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,190
gac session also patrick filestream said

93
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:27,790
then organization like the ITF already

94
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:30,670
has kind of oversight built in their

95
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:34,360
processes so is it possible that and and

96
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:49,600
even that some run first and the DNA the

97
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:51,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS part might run later what money so</font>

98
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,120
just on your first question which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

99
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:58,870
about additional changes we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

100
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,860
received a thousand proposals for the

101
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,920
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> process that was published right</font>

102
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,440
we can't stay in a loop of changes to

103
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the process this is the process of how</font>

104
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,460
we're going to run the process if we

105
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,490
keep doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we'll find ourselves</font>

106
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,770
frankly missing a huge window of

107
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,900
opportunity to get this done so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

108
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,690
you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with me that we we had a</font>

109
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:26,739
big dialogue in Singapore we issued an

110
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:30,160
initial document we received a thousand

111
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,680
comments that we spent weeks analyzing

112
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,880
and working with the team on as a result

113
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,890
on june sixth we published in you so and

114
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,990
we we changed the process completely

115
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:44,919
based on the input<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got we expanded it</font>

116
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:46,960
we now 27 people we reduce the role of

117
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,820
the role of the board we did all kinds

118
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,200
of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sense that</font>

119
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,440
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Coordinating Committee</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

120
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:56,020
definitely not run by i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> has full</font>

121
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,940
representation we add a diversity to the

122
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,979
representation to ensure people come

123
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,230
from all over the world so all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

124
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,850
was done and now we published it now

125
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,160
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep coming back with</font>

126
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,380
changes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think at some point we</font>

127
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,270
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get going so at the moment the</font>

128
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,490
plan is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first meeting of the</font>

129
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:16,030
coordinating group to occur on july

130
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:18,760
seventeenth here in this hotel probably

131
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:22,210
in this room so that they can start the

132
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,740
work towards really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

133
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,409
perfect but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we're close enough</font>

134
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,720
and most communities we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our very</font>

135
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,370
pleased right now so there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

136
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,900
additional demands no one will find it

137
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,630
perfect but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we need to move on</font>

138
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this day</font>

139
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,370
is my sense and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have to</font>

140
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:40,250
spend the next few months talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

141
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:44,540
real substance and and how to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

142
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:47,600
the transition of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stewardship yeah I</font>

143
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,820
I want to simply emphasize the last

144
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,550
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Fadi made and alluded to</font>

145
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,800
before the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> coordination committee is</font>

146
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,560
not where the action is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be it</font>

147
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,510
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter in the end of it how much</font>

148
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,640
you fiddle with expanding it or

149
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:04,610
adjusting the composition it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

151
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,350
the real work is in thinking through

152
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:13,330
what the issues are and the more time we

153
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:15,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">spend on trying to fiddle with the</font>

154
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,570
coordination body the less time we're

155
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,719
going to wind up with actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

156
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:23,270
into a substantive discussion so to your

157
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,870
point of the substantive discussions are

158
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:29,659
what are the stewardship issues where

159
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:32,000
are the where will the oversight be in

160
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:35,180
future iono processes where is the

161
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,870
division<font color="#E5E5E5"> between policy and execution</font>

162
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,850
and getting that blueprint clear is what

163
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,830
has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done and we really need the</font>

164
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:45,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who are knowledgeable about the</font>

169
00:07:54,230 --> 00:08:00,650
rest is a kind of administrative piecing

170
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,850
together of that and that's where the

171
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:08,500
real action is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come quick</font>

172
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:11,600
follow-up and your personal opinion on

173
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:15,190
does it have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in one place the</font>

174
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:19,040
oversight or could it just be broken up

175
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:22,160
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very clear I can was</font>

183
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:48,270

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,109
supporting organizations many mechanisms

192
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:15,180
we should ensure that the proper concern

193
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,779
the proper mechanisms are in place to

194
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">address the concerns people have about</font>

195
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:21,810
separation of certain functions from

196
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,060
others and we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some of these</font>

00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,219
strengthened<font color="#CCCCCC"> by all means as Steve said</font>

199
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:33,320
it is this coordinating group that needs

200
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:36,060
to guide us on this but the scope is

201
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,270
clear the scope<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been published we</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wisest thing to do we have I</font>

205
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">can hear today let's make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a better</font>

206
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,970
place and it's working quite well thank

207
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,010
you hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm Lisa Fleisher with the Wall</font>

208
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,200
Street Journal people would say that

209
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,890
these days domains aren't as important

210
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,680
than before you know we have apps on our

211
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,839
phones we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google Facebook you know</font>

212
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,510
all the traffic goes through there so

213
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,810
what does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter who is in charge of</font>

214
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:11,010
rubber stamping whether domain names get

215
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:13,640
improved or not can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little</font>

216
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:17,520
about that I think you should go ask

217
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,040
3343 people with this event but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

218
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,470
obviously matters you're correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

219
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think if I ask my children when is the</font>

220
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">last time they typed a web domain name</font>

221
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,430
they probably would not remember when

222
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,510
they did so you have a point that the

223
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:35,250
apps and the search engines are also

224
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:38,340
mechanisms by which people find things

225
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:41,340
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what is becoming very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clear</font>

226
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:44,640
is that the domain name is not just a

227
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:47,190
mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find something it is more</font>

228
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,150
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mechanism to fight</font>

229
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:52,890
something with certain criteria that a

230
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:57,420
search doesn't give you for example

231
00:10:52,890 --> 00:11:02,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so if if you wanted to make sure</font>

232
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:04,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> st. Michael's School in Mara bone</font>

233
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,770
here next door is really a Catholic

234
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:11,900
school you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't today by googling</font>

235
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:14,939
it because anybody can be anybody today

236
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:17,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">but if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find st. Michael school dot</font>

237
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,850
Catholic because they were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

238
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:24,920
that denomination from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Doc Catholic that</font>

239
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:28,140
criteria tied to that TLD serves

240
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,689
authentication that's one value of a TLD

241
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:35,180
and that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for the Catholics</font>

242
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:37,080
believe me for example luxury goods

243
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,839
manufacturers around the world are

244
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,880
reeling from the people copying their

245
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,950
goods and calling a Cartier watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> occur</font>

246
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:47,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you and it isn't but if you buy a</font>

247
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:49,589
watch on my shop<font color="#E5E5E5"> karti you will know</font>

248
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,990
it's authentic so authenticity is one

249
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:56,280
important thing another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

250
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:58,140
obviously a community I'm part of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

251
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,540
small minority in Egypt called the

252
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:03,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">Coptic Church and we are working</font>

253
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,949
together to build Coptic so we can tie

254
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,530
our community around the globe our

255
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,630
institutions our churches our our

256
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:12,060
community that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very valuable because</font>

257
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:14,520
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course if i type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Coptic in a search I</font>

258
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,199
will get everything including every word

259
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,730
written and every book<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it will be</font>

260
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,070
very difficult for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to authenticate</font>

261
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,320
that this is a document I can count on

262
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:25,530
in my community so there are many many

263
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,170
ways people will use the domain name

264
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,970
system not just so they don't type a

265
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:33,589
long IP address which was the original

266
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:36,780
purpose but maybe to authenticate to

267
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:40,020
build community cities around the world

268
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">France is actually going to consider</font>

269
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,100
holding a major conference called dot

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,650
their citizens NYC is looking at that

00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">now so you can you know you could put</font>

00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">your address top NYC and maybe one day</font>

276
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,770
you'll find<font color="#CCCCCC"> your bills and your services</font>

277
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,600
and unfortunately your parking tickets

278
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:02,910
and everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to pay so</font>

279
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,510
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of ways that companies</font>

280
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:08,819
will brand authenticate and use the web

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that different now than in the</font>

283
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:17,850
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> now than far be because the</font>

284
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:21,930
web has become so vast that you need a

285
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:24,410
way within that these hundreds of

286
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:28,589
millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of websites to actually rise</font>

287
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:30,839
today you search where you pay somebody

288
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:33,750
so that the search results put you up

289
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,730
front but the domain name system will

290
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,010
evolve as a mechanism for people to

291
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,020
actually brand themselves in the

<font color="#CCCCCC">cyberspace</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and as you may have heard me</font>

293
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,610
say last week<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my opinion you know</font>

294
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,459
cyberspace is that there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">cyberspace and learning cyber I don't</font>

00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,910
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take up too much time but didn't</font>

297
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,050
just using that the fact that the domain

298
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,060
names are so important for

299
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:57,329
authentication certainty security

300
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,489
doesn't that give more bed like suit

301
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,930
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> that make the argument to these</font>

302
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:05,160
wine producers as we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been hearing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">even more yeah cereal it yes yeah</font>

304
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:11,459
absolutely their argument is extremely

305
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,439
serious the question is they followed

306
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:16,020
the process they are not done following

307
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,340
the process they should keep doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

308
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:20,130
they're doing follow the process that

00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a big step there we the</font>

government and other governments in

314
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,540
Europe were trying to pursue that that

315
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:38,670
agenda could not come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a consensus so</font>

316
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:40,469
you know we the board with Steve's

317
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,329
leadership this week issued another

318
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,270
letter saying look if you guys have

319
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,680
other advice if you can with the same

320
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:49,590
passion we heard from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> French</font>

321
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,620
minister today convinced the GAC to come

322
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:54,120
to a different

323
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,880
consensus by all means we're here we're

324
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,000
here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen so I think what we need</font>

325
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is to just focus on the process</font>

326
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,589
make sure it's fair it's open it allows

327
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,870
everybody to voice themselves and not

328
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:08,670
frankly scream that nothing is working

329
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,100
when we don't get what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:12,660
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> often don't get what we want it's</font>

331
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,940
important though to follow the process

332
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,610
and they still have many steps they have

333
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,769
many options I hope they will pursue

334
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,759
them vigorously and with with

335
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:27,209
transparency and openness on my side

336
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:29,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">guaranteed it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even in this case</font>

337
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:30,959
getting what they want it's getting what

338
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,690
they want the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way they wanted to get it</font>

they think they're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is underlined</font>

340
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:39,870
quite common cause authenticity and

341
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:45,029
assurance that products are the right

342
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:47,519
products is a shared value and the the

343
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:51,209
subtlety is exactly where do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put</font>

344
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,089
those mechanisms and there are still

345
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:57,149
many steps in many avenues available to

346
00:15:54,089 --> 00:16:00,990
provide that<font color="#CCCCCC"> level of assurance and the</font>

347
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:04,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular path that the France and</font>

348
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:08,189
other countries pursued did not prevail

349
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,750
within the GAC so then that leads to if

350
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:11,519
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want then</font>

351
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,670
the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> must be wrong kind of</font>

352
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:19,319
thinking and I would have preferred

353
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:24,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">would hope that the support for the</font>

354
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:27,209
process which is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> vital and each of</font>

355
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:32,189
these countries<font color="#CCCCCC"> will come to depend upon</font>

356
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:34,529
it for other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things should be a value to</font>

00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:37,769
be preserved<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it does not mean that</font>

358
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:39,449
they've lost out on the core issue

359
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:41,040
that's underlying their concern there's

360
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:43,829
plenty of ways for that to be pursued

361
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:49,230
and I fully<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect that at the end of</font>

optic of the global domains within the

across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the regions as you very well know</font>

400
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:44,500
we received<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall 1930 applications</font>

some of these of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course are in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font>

actually in contention sets so we will

403
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:54,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably delegate around 1300</font>

406
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:04,649
signed 440 contracts and we have

407
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:08,610
delegated 320 out of these 440 contracts

408
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:11,760
I think also you've asked what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

409
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:16,229
doing about increasing the footprint of

410

the TL DS in the developing countries so

411
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:23,190
right now as you know the rat this round

412
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,870
is the application round has been closed

413
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:27,060
so we received all the applications we

414
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,699
will receive we have moved<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward with</font>

415
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,320
the processing of these applications but

416
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,530
we are committed to having a second

417
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:37,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">round we have also some commitments to</font>

419
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:44,189
round we're working on these commitments

420
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:46,230
like measuring the awareness the<font color="#E5E5E5"> global</font>

promoted the competition in the

00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,979
marketplace so so we have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

425
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,300
some steps to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do before we can do the</font>

second<font color="#E5E5E5"> round but we're committed to that</font>

427
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:07,560
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of efforts ongoing in</font>

428
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,300
the development world and like we have

429
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,149
the middle and Middle East we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

working group that is come together from

the local community there for the Middle

East and Africa working on what they

433
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,930

00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:51,330
posted a working group paper on how to

00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,700
increase the number of registrar's in

443
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:58,649
the developing world and there are a lot

444
00:20:53,700 --> 00:21:00,840
of suggestions in there for<font color="#E5E5E5"> four I can</font>

445
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,880
to look into and we will consider

446
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,159
whatever the community comes back with

447
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,380
the board will look into those and

448
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,030
consider what if there are any programs

449
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,550
that we should actually put in place to

450
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> increase number of registrar's in</font>

00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:21,590
least of which is universal acceptance

455
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,590
you know universal acceptance is

456
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:28,070
basically accepting all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the idea ends</font>

457
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:33,889
across multiple barriers and making sure

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:37,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet the DNS works in other</font>

460
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,080
program is also underway and let's

461
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:44,780
remember that we've had for the first

462
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,560
time over a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred applications in</font>

463
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:53,389
scripts not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Latin script and these</font>

464
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:56,510
scripts enable Arabic Chinese Cyrillic

465
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:58,790
and other other languages to coexist

466
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:00,440
with Latin on the on the internet so

467
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">that somebody that's looking for</font>

468
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,250
something does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have to use multiple</font>

469
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:06,650
keyboards they can use their native

keyboard across everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do if</font>

471
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:11,660
they only use one one language in one

472
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:14,180
script so all of these programs<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

473
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:18,230
things that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is developing</font>

474
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:24,080
and making to enable the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS and make</font>

475
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:26,060
the DNS a friction free system in on the

00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the local engagement strategies</font>

479
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,010
that fatty has mentioned that's very

480
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:36,500
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> our aim is doing it with the local</font>

00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:37,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">community there try and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build capacity</font>

482
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,920
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> encouraging people to create more</font>

483
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:42,560
registrar's people to get involved in

485
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,429
our major draw is to be as part of the

globalization effort of icon is to go

487

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with the community to to be</font>
