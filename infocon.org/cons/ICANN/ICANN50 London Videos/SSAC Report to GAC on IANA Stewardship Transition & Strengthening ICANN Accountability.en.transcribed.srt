00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:17,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how the policies are changed and</font>

00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:20,750
also who is actually validating the

00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:22,489
change requests on which basis thank you

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,009
first of all I completely agree with you

6
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:28,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why we in a sack</font>

has only developed this<font color="#E5E5E5"> flowchart in</font>

00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:33,980
very general terms because what we see

is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion in the</font>

some degree from<font color="#E5E5E5"> our perspective is</font>

00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:44,589
unclear where the discussion is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

13
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:46,940
the policy development process or

00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:49,909
whether it is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy</font>

00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,980
implementation part or whether it is

00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:53,839
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the handover of the policy between</font>

18

implementer who is validating that the

19
00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:00,769
policy is clear enough how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle</font>

20
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:04,069
cases where the policy is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not clear</font>

21
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:07,130
enough how do you afterwards audit and

22
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:10,000
validate that the policy implementer was

23
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:12,920
actually following the policy or not and

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,590
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I was my vice chair Jim Galvin</font>

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,720
came to me and said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that once again not</font>

26
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,420
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a native english-speaking person I</font>

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,429
mix up the word objective and subjective

28
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,110
which of course is something that is

29
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,850
really important here but I should not

30
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:28,370
make mistakes<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and I actually did</font>

31
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:31,820
so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me put on the record that the</font>

32
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:34,010
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that iono function the</font>

33
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,380
policy implementer should do only

34
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">objective decisions and not subjective</font>

35
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,899
decisions the reason why ATF do have

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,390
appointed experts is to minimize the

37
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,940
pressure and remove subjective decisions

38
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:50,180
from my Anna just to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that clear</font>

39
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:56,030
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have is do you envisage</font>

40
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:59,090
or do we envisage that the same routing

41
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:03,370
process or the same structure of the

42
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:09,128
work will be continued exactly as it is

43
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:14,120
when this stewardship is transferred

44
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:17,090
second currently without making any

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,750
judgment do

46
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:25,900
the quality of the actions or work which

47
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:28,879
is done once it is transferred to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

48
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:33,220
multi-stakeholder that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seed we don't</font>

49
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:37,519
know what is it would you envisage that

50
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:42,560
there might be some period of

51
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:46,250
transitions which may cause some

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,500
difficulties in the processing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

53
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:53,840
matters<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are answers to those</font>

54
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:55,880
questions are the ones that we are

55
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,180
seeking with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process that we started</font>

56
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,859
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> London which means that i am not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

57
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">individual that are going to respond to</font>

58
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,959
those this community is to respond to

59
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,640
those questions what we believe from the

60
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,180
security and stability advisor committee

61
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:14,988
is that whatever those questions are our

62
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:18,319
suggestion to the community is to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

63
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:20,900
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the various roles are for</font>

64
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,958
example and to help that discussion we

65
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:28,180
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> providing this flow chart which we</font>

66
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:32,030
think is the is one easy way of if it is

67
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:34,220
made clear who is doing what to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get good</font>

68
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:38,019
answers to for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example the questions</font>

69
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:40,849
that you answered whenever we in

70
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:42,230
administration's talk about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

71
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:44,510
first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that comes to mind is</font>

72
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,819
security stability is the system gonna

73
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,269
be rock solid when we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through this</font>

74
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:53,450
transition and so your inputs are going

75
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:55,099
to you know relate directly to what we

76
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">in are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be saying to our</font>

77
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:59,899
ministers and and and so on it's a

78
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:05,060
pretty new thing for our site to give a

79
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,709
timeline at all and actually in the

80
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,680
previous document we tried and we failed

81
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:11,389
miserable and that's why it'll be

82
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,669
dangerous to say something like closer

83
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:15,440
than third quarter<font color="#E5E5E5"> but between friends</font>

84
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:18,289
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you only you listen to what I'm</font>

85
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,120
saying the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you whole years we</font>

86
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:21,918
are we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very close the</font>

87
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,340
documents are very close<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we are we</font>

88
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,140
are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through more or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> less editing</font>

89
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,049
final editing of the documents and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

90
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,270
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everyone in a sec do feel them</font>

91
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,300
as the members of SF do stand behind the

92
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,940
text it's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to everyone reading it to</font>

93
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,890
to take the whole documents or part of

94
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,340
the documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they that they that</font>

95
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:45,500
they think is in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fayette like to use</font>

96
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,419
the text it's really important that our

97
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,990
site members do feel comfortable of the

98
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:54,200
text so we are as<font color="#CCCCCC"> far as in that process</font>

99
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:56,659
which normally in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sack has been it can</font>

100
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,760
take from a few weeks to maybe a month

101
00:04:56,659 --> 00:05:00,169
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little difficult because of the</font>

102
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,940
summer and hold days and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other kind of</font>

103
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:03,169
thing so why would even if so but we are

104
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,909
not saying anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than a third</font>

105
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:06,440
quarter because if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the case that</font>

106
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:07,700
some individuals do feel a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

107
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,740
uncomfortable it might take a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

108
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer time to shift around text but</font>

109
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,580
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case that we are no longer</font>

110
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:16,539
sort of writing the document but third

111
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,539
quarter is what we are saying
