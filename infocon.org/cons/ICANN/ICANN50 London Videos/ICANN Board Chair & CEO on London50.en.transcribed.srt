for a long time and has finally come to

whole bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of new people who want to</font>

understand what all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is about I</font>

think it's I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a singular</font>

28
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:15,450
moment one of the maturation points for

29
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,009
I can and it wouldn't have happened we

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,420
wouldn't be here if there hadn't been an

31
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,329
understanding that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

32
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,880
reached this point already and then in

33
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:26,399
addition to that a visiting or

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,509
revisiting of I<font color="#CCCCCC"> canons</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accountability</font>

35
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:31,649
it's something that we spend a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

36
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,409
time on but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again it's another evidence</font>

37
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:38,340
that that we've reached a critical point

38
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:43,049
in our growth process in our maturation

39
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:47,700
and both are very positive body yes I

40
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:50,069
agree and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the conduct of the</font>

41
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,329
meetings as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as the participation</font>

42
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:58,770
from the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> are evidence clear</font>

43
00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:01,139
evidence that the I can model<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work is</font>

44
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,990
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> model and everyone can</font>

45
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:08,068
participate and will participate I think

46
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:11,430
we saw at this meeting a true maturation

47
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:13,200
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i Ken meeting a lot of people</font>

48
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,110
left feeling that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> got their work</font>

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">done they had their views hurt</font>

50
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:22,530
and as you notice this well Brad during

the closing public<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment public forum</font>

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,120

53
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,700
dialogue as well so delighted to see

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,510
frankly and I can meeting start becoming

55
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:36,510
more about the substantive core issues

56
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,670
and the conduct of the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

comfortable towards progress and

101
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,840
the board took a very big step and said

111
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,099
through a period of examining the work

that they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> produced from every</font>

115
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,150
a larger objectives and so forth the

116
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:21,930
privacy issues that Stephanie Perrin

117
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:24,150
raises are important it there's also an

118
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,130
evolution in general about privacy

119
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,320
issues in the internet never mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

120
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,930
who is or<font color="#E5E5E5"> about registration data but</font>

121
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,010
this is a major issue across the entire

122
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet in every aspect of public life</font>

123
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:39,060
and so it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little while</font>

124
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:42,860
to ring out all of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> details and</font>

125
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:45,390
come to a some conclusion about that

126
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,670
this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the important debates and</font>

127
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,460
one of the important in the life<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

internet not just in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the life of I can</font>

129
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:56,419
with I could read three points on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

130
00:05:53,070 --> 00:06:00,870
first it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recognize that</font>

131
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:02,610
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an issue that has really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> risen</font>

132
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,030
to the point where it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming</font>

133
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:09,330
problematic we do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a directory</font>

134
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,799
services model that addresses many of

135
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:14,280
the needs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the concerns of the</font>

136
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,470
community and so first recognition<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

137
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,719
the leadership of the i kin community in

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,780
that expert working group met daily to

00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,940
actually get this report out so it

143
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,190
should be recognized<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second is to</font>

144
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,430
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just a report as</font>

145
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:41,540

146
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:45,670
actually start<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real work of building</font>

147
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:49,310
policies so nothing in this report is

148
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:51,920
final so any concerns that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are still</font>

149
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,830
there from any camp including those

150
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,960
concerned with privacy we have plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

151
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,390
time to address<font color="#E5E5E5"> them this is simply a</font>

152
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,909
report that gets the conversation going

153
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:05,810
that's very very important and the third

154
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:09,050
is to note that the privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue as</font>

155
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,600
Steve said crosses many things we do and

156
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,490
it cannot be addressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in isolation it</font>

157
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,950
has to be addressed in the broader sense

158
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:21,260
and understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that tug</font>

159
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:23,510
at privacy and together with mrs.<font color="#CCCCCC"> Perrin</font>

160
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,820
we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring these issues to the fore</font>

161
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,700
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to assure everyone as i'm</font>

163
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,950
remains very vigilant about issues of

164
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:36,200
privacy this is not a dismissal of the

165
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,849
importance of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues quite the</font>

00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,230
participated like everyone for 15 months

168
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,830
and we thank her for her<font color="#CCCCCC"> incredible</font>

170
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,150
the end she will inform the process as

171
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,909
we move forward fadi let me ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

172
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,380
about another high point of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICANN 50</font>

176
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:05,630
the point of that meeting what came out

177
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:08,690
of it what came out of it is first a

178
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:13,219
much broader understanding of what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

179

is and does in the governmental circles

180
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:19,010
and that's helpful so when our own<font color="#CCCCCC"> gack</font>

or governmental advisory committee

183
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,840
back to their capitals and share with

that the technical community has an

258
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:09,010
the fears we have of any one party

the US Congress has questions to me

enormous economic value and cohesion to

267
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:37,360
this week is an actual practical

268
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:39,970
effective step on the part of the

269
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,640
Chinese government to say we're going to

270

frankly historic Steve some very

278
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:11,830
impressive numbers at ICANN 50 more than

279

3,900 registered participants<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3,100 of</font>

280
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:17,350
them actually checked in that's an

281
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,870
amazing number a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reactions</font>

282
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,150
first of all it's good news in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general</font>

283
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:25,510
second of all it really means that

284
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:28,180
a larger set of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are paying</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">attention to I can and so the impact</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that I can as having and the attention</font>

287
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,579
is getting is spreading more broadly it

288
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">also suggests that you can't have growth</font>

289
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:42,610
like that without some structural

290
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:43,900
changes and raises question of sort of

291
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,880
whether we're busting at the seams

292
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,500
whether we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can handle the set of issues</font>

293
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,670
that these people bring or whether we

294
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,830
need to undergo some further

295
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:54,099
transformation so we're looking at that

296
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:56,470
very closely<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think that will see</font>

297
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,750
some some evolution and our processes

298
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:02,470
which are aimed at being even more

299
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:04,210
accessible and at the same time finding

300
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,400
a way to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> more manageable in our</font>

301
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,840
processes body what does this mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

302
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,600
future meetings when you have those sort

303
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,600
of attendance numbers we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do as</font>

304
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:17,250
Steve suggested some analysis of this

305
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:21,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">situation because I think two things</font>

306
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:24,880
contributed to the high numbers that may

307
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:27,760
not repeat the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first is London is a very</font>

308
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,700
attractive City it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great city it's a</font>

309
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,900
central point and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people came I</font>

310
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:37,150
think attracted to London so we may not

311
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:41,350
see these high numbers in subsequent

312
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:47,189
years the second thing is I think due to

313
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:49,990
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet governance phase we're in I</font>

314
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:53,170
think that there was a lot of interest

315
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:56,770
to come here to discuss I can matters

316
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:59,640
but also in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some circles discuss broader</font>

317
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:03,520
internet governance matters which again

318
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:07,170
my hope is and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> our hope is to</font>

319
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:10,720
not conflate these two things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I can</font>

320
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:13,089
that once I can will remain as I said a

321
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:17,620
clear participant in internet governance

322
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:21,430
and will certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> represent the views</font>

323
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:23,470
and the values we have for the

324
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:26,459
identifies the names<font color="#E5E5E5"> and numbers in</font>

325
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:30,460
internet govern circles we should not

326
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:33,040
expand our role and hence also our

327
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,590
meetings to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a place for broader</font>

328
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,689
Internet Governance discussions these

329
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:41,170
should have a home they have already

330
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:44,740
many homes and we should enhance these

331
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:47,829
homes like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDF and support them and</font>

332
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:50,230
other fora other alliances that may be

333
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:53,410
formed in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create these places</font>

334
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:57,040
for people to meet and solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems</font>

335
00:15:53,410 --> 00:16:01,180
and and therefore I think that we will

336
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,730
see a more careful analysis of the

337
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,890
meetings and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agendas of the meetings</font>

338
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,780
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the size of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the meetings now I'm</font>

339
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:09,850
from Los Angeles and the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting is</font>

340
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,680
in Los Angeles and I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least</font>

341
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,510
have to stand up<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my city and say</font>

342
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,089
that it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> as attractive as London</font>

343
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:19,390
and I hope many will come as well we

344
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:20,980
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a slowdown in this in the</font>

345
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,990
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least in the next couple of meetings</font>

346
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,890
very good gentlemen thank you very much

347
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,890
thank you you
