a better way to do it what other

145
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,120
mechanisms and methodologies we use this

146
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,490
is the time for all of us to discuss

147
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,180
this and to agree together how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

148
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:57,100
actually strengthen our accountability

149
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,770
last night I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a meeting with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

150
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,419
the minister's here from Europe and she

151
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,150
and I were chatting about the importance

152
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:06,669
of accountability and how this is the

153
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:09,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">roadmap to ensuring that an independent</font>

155
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">committed to that on this second track</font>

156
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,280
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the track most of us are</font>

157
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,950
focused on we have received over a

158
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,440
thousand email comments and many

159
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:26,289
proposals after the meeting in Singapore

160
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,690
a thousand email comments we sifted

161
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:31,240
through all of this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> after a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

162
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:34,539

168
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,510
this meeting but it's a document that

169
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:53,589
calls for the creation of a coordination

170
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:55,540
group of 27 members representing 13

171
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:58,810
parts of our great internet community

172
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:03,250
all coming together to figure out what's

173
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:05,829
the best course forward in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end</font>

00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:08,589
the unique relationship that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US</font>

we are not driving we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not supposed</font>

180

driving<font color="#E5E5E5"> do stop us this is your process</font>

181
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:31,359
this is the community's process and

182
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,580
through it I am certain that when we

183
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,010
remove the training wheels that i can

184
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,970
has had in the great stewardship of the

186
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:46,300
this process that we will do together

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">now if you want to participate more in</font>

188
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:52,180
all these tracks we have two important

189
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:55,540
meetings on<font color="#E5E5E5"> thursday do attend do</font>

190
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:58,359
participate and please do give<font color="#E5E5E5"> us input</font>

191
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,769
this is your process again and I'm glad

192
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we have these two important</font>

193
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:03,579
sessions that will squeeze some time out

194
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,000
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our public forum but they are</font>

195
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:08,500
critical for us to be on the same page

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,810
my second area of focus is the

197
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">globalization and hardening of ICANN</font>

198
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,489
operations we are on a journey I think

199
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:18,550
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> about two two maybe three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

200
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:20,500
to go before frankly I'm comfortable

201
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,689
that I can operations are where they

202
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,420
need to be but that journey has started

203
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,880
and we're already<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving forward and at</font>

204
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,759
the heart<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the hardening of our</font>

205
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,220
operations is also to globalize it now

206
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:35,980
in normal places<font color="#CCCCCC"> have worked you don't</font>

207
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:39,160
do this at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you typically</font>

208
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,750
sequence these you harden the operations

209
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,439
and then you start thinking how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

210
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:47,110
globalize unfortunately hear it I can we

211
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:50,440
don't have that<font color="#CCCCCC"> luxury of time we had to</font>

212
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:53,199
move on both and so we've laid out a set

213
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,449
of activities<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are very important to</font>

214
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:57,329
go on this mission I'm summarizing them

215
00:10:55,449 --> 00:11:01,209
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you just so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a sense</font>

216
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:04,510
expanding our three channels how are we

217
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:07,839
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by starting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bring the</font>

218
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:09,730
ICANN engagement into other fora it

219
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,740
doesn't always<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to happen at ICANN</font>

220
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,420
meetings so we are discovering that

221
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are many places where we can do</font>

222
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,399
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are building service channels</font>

223
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,260
for the first time you can pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the</font>

224
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">phone and China any time of day while</font>

225
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,519
you're awake and Cole I can and someone

226
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,889
will answer you in your language and

227
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,589
help you and we're expanding that model

228
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:33,579
across many regions and we intend to

229
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:35,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a 24 by five I can line in more</font>

230
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:38,349
than 20 languages available so we're

231
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:40,689
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards that we tested it it's</font>

232
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,630
been a very big success and we will

233
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:46,990
expand it community driven language

234
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:48,610
localization so yes we stuck for a long

235
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,800
time with the UN languages<font color="#CCCCCC"> plus</font>

236
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,949
Portuguese but who says these are the

237
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,380
only languages huh so we need to go

238
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:59,050
beyond that<font color="#E5E5E5"> how are we doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this by</font>

239
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,269
building relationships locally I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

call out Korea South Korea has done a

I can and making sure we are truly

understanding the local needs and their

understanding what I can does we are in

260
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,530
enlarging our touch points around the

261
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:57,280
world the touch points come in hubs and

262
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:59,829
they come also in individuals that we

have around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the globe I can will have</font>

270
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:22,420
little bit on the hubs for decentralized

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:26,699
operations our ability to become global

272
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:29,160
is only possible if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> start truly</font>

273
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,240
decentralizing our operations and

decentralizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> operations something I've</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">done in other places before does not</font>

276
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,680
mean simply sending people from Los

277
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:41,230
Angeles to work in other places it means

278
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,420
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking a whole function and</font>

279

starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move it to work elsewhere</font>

280
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,040
and making this other location the

and we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this in Istanbul and in</font>

00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:17,530
compliance working well and so today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

290
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:21,910
happy to tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in 2011 we had</font>

291
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:25,120
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> five staff employees today we have</font>

292
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,740
16 in LA three in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Istanbul and two</font>

293
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,660
because we have one new employees start

294
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:32,140
today so we now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> two in Singapore</font>

295
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:35,290
and they work 24 hours a day so

296
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:37,720
compliance can answer your requests of

297
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,730
the community 24 hours a day in nine

298
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,340
languages and they have started to

299
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:45,490
standardized processes so when you file

300
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,650
a compliance issue in Singapore at 2pm

301
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,540
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Singapore but then you follow up</font>

302
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:52,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">with somebody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who wakes up in Istanbul</font>

303
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:55,209
later that case is standardized it's in

304
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,340
a system and we can follow through for

305
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:00,880
you around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just an</font>

led by my friend jean-francois burial

330
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:10,030
they came together when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community</font>

331
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,490
was telling me it's been a decade and we

332
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:15,520
can't get these directory services to

333
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,410
actually advance who is was created for

334
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,500
a different technical reason it was

335
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:23,290
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a different time now we are</font>

336
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,030
relying on it to really have directory

337
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,689
services these are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things</font>

338
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:30,939
and so we launched<font color="#E5E5E5"> this great effort led</font>

by Jean Francois and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you</font>

341
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:38,520
simply input to us as a community

342
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,800
so that we can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and yesterday we</font>

evolve directory services for the

347
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:53,580
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the world will come from</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">incredible focus on privacy and an</font>

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:15,490
exist exactly a year ago a year ago we

374
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:19,090

from you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to give focus to</font>

that division continues to grow and

lot of work to do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> please understand</font>

385
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:50,710
a year ago we put our hands together to

386
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:54,490
build a lot of services a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems</font>

a lot of capabilities while the<font color="#E5E5E5"> program</font>

program on hold for a few years why we

391
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:06,190
build all these things but we didn't

392
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,770
because the community was clear we

393
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,720
needed to move forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> built as we</font>

394
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:14,440
went and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means sometimes</font>

forward we can be with all the others we

can participate as we have done for

480
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,860
years but we no longer need to lead

481

<font color="#E5E5E5">to get out of Lebanon and</font>

495
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:15,870
he put me on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> lorry and he told me</font>

496
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:18,480
one thing he said son you have to go and

497
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:22,409
make this happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> but one thing don't</font>

498
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:26,160
forget your core values<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't forget who</font>

499
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:28,740
you are that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said and I</font>

war is gone lots of things are gone but

505
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:46,740
the core values he left me with are here

506
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,170
today it's what drives me and I can for
