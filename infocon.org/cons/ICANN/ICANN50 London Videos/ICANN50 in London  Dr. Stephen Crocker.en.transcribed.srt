2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:13,849
prepared remarks but I want to first say

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:16,160
something that is of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment here</font>

4
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:20,390
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been informed that our registration</font>

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,130
has crossed the 3000 mark which is far

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:30,439
far and away above anything that we've

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:31,909

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason why is it because of controversy</font>

10
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,140
is it because of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good weather is it</font>

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:43,129
because of London or maybe or maybe

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,929
something else and the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

13
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:46,640
