00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,350
on the fourteenth of March the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA</font>

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:12,170
announced its intention to transition

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:15,320
its stewardship role and called on<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,970
to launch a process with the

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,670
multi-stakeholder community and to

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,198
facilitate that so it's very important

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,960
that we're the facilitator for it we're

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">not running it that brings together all</font>

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,570
stakeholders and comes up with a

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,060
proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> that meets the criteria set out</font>

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,850
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA and all that information is</font>

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,180
available online through consultations

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:41,180
with the community and<font color="#E5E5E5"> extensive input</font>

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:45,410
we received proposals around how to

15
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:47,239
create a coordination group and how that

16
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:50,419
coordination group should be populated

17
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:54,129
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> representation from 13 different</font>

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:57,019
stakeholder groups a<font color="#E5E5E5"> total number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of 27</font>

19
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:58,699
to be selected by those stakeholder

20
00:00:57,019 --> 00:01:01,489
groups themselves and then have

21
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:03,949
responsibilities for pulling in the

22
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:05,990
proposals from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community itself come</font>

23
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:08,509
up with one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that meets the criteria set</font>

24
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,479
out by<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia so that would be the the</font>

25
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:14,270
first process the second process itself

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:18,020
relates to<font color="#CCCCCC"> icann accountability so a</font>

27
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:22,369
topic that came up in relation to nti

28
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:24,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">A's announcement was what happens what</font>

29
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,750
happens to I can regarding

30
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,390
accountability when its relationship its

31
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,570
historical ties to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. change when</font>

32
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:35,180
that ends through the ending of their

33
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,190
role in the stewardship role and that's

34
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,480
an important topic overall I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

35
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,070
accountability has always been an

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,010
important topic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've taken it very</font>

37
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,300
seriously and we have the affirmation of

38
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,610
commitments with the US administration

39
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,160
which have a review mechanism around

40
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:51,289
that itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> on accountability and</font>

41
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,920
transparency but looking specifically at

42
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:59,000
this issue it was important to launch a

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:02,210
process as well and to look at what we

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,350
have in<font color="#CCCCCC"> place what we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

45
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:08,869
strengthening what what maybe some

46
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,878
identified gaps and how to solve for

47
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:14,450
those and so that process was also

48
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,780
launched<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the work of that process and</font>

49
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,019
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to funk</font>

50
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,730
is under discussion right now and the

51
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,500
work of that in the end will help

52
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,600
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> that specific area of concern</font>

53
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,220
and of course the organization continues

54
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,350
to be committed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to strengthening its</font>

55
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,300
accountability more broadly where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

56
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,069
now and where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going from a</font>

57
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,270
community standpoint it means continuing

58
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,829
to do our jobs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and doing it well</font>

59
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,739
continuing to be accountable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

60
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,840
transparent and engaging globally and

61
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,790
from a staff standpoint it also means

62
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,590
engaging with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> community members in</font>

doing our work and continuing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it</font>

well accountability has<font color="#E5E5E5"> always been</font>
