about them this is the time of year

12
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:35,190
which we do have members departing and

13
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:37,230
members arriving and so it's always

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,899
interesting and with a certain amount of

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,578
anticipation who's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and how</font>

spectacular new board members each very

different from the other we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lido</font>

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:09,270
there's a piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> history there that he</font>

their marks and sour bitter sweet sense

34
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:46,710
of loss there but the new people are

35
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:50,579
incredible good so with this new board

36
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,649
what are your hopes for them well the

37
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,619
hopes for the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> really are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font>

38
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:59,880
entwined with hopes for I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can and for</font>

39
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:03,359
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet community as a whole all of</font>

40
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,880
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been involved rather intensively</font>

41
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,220
with the transition<font color="#CCCCCC"> process and most</font>

42
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,899
particularly with the development of the

43
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,870
accountability mechanisms that are

44
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:16,750
coming out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sea cwg and the board</font>

45
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:19,680
is as a meshed and involved in that

46
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:23,050
as every other part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the community</font>

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,000
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my perspective I have two hopes one</font>

48
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,370
is of course that that process goes

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,710
through and continues and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

50
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,870
pretty good actually and that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

51
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:34,540
lot to do to execute and put those piece

52
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:37,209
together and then we have the regular

53
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:40,170
business of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can is all about and</font>

54
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:43,230
the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> is focused on how to</font>

55
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,970
continually improve<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can how to get our</font>

56
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,480
regular order of business taken care of

57
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,370
and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move things to the next level</font>

58
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">Thank You fati so this week has been</font>

59
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,209
busy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you characterize the</font>

60
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,609
progress that has been made on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iono</font>

61
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:00,400
stewardship transition during I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can 54</font>

62
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:04,540
in Dublin I think this week exceeded all

63
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,090
expectations we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> come together we</font>

64
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:11,679
have built consensus we have removed

65
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:14,050
many of the misunderstandings<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

66
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,000
community has come together we cannot

67
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:19,360
ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for more Dublin has been good to us</font>

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,700
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we leave Dublin from this</font>

69
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,980
week we still have work to do to

70
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">complete this transition but I think a</font>

71
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,380
clear path is drawn now and everyone is

72
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:31,810
in sync as to what we still need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

73
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:35,200
to get it done and that in itself is a

74
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:37,000
great triumph for Dublin so yes the

75
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,089
community has worked tirelessly on this

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,590
and what would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you advise the community</font>

77
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,519
moving forward to keep this momentum

78
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:48,910
going I think the spirit of Dublin needs

79
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,950
to continue the spirit of working

80
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">together of understanding each other of</font>

81
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:56,140
listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to each other endless hours</font>

82
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,790
were spent here in Dublin either in

83
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,339
meeting rooms or in the hallways or

84
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,679
sometimes in the pubs that enabled

85
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,720
people to listen and to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

86
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,840
other I think we have narrowed the

87
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,260
remaining questions to very few that I

88
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,470
believe are very much addressable with

89
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,810
the continued commitment to the core

90
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">values</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that brought us together from the</font>

91
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:24,160
very beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were evident</font>

92
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:25,810
this week frankly remarkably<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what</font>

93
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,289
binds us together the principles that

94
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:31,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">bind us together got us great success</font>

95
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:33,099
this week still have worked too

96
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,349
and we cannot lose this great momentum

97
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:37,810
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the weeks ahead will be</font>

98
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:39,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">important and we are all committed to</font>

99
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,740
get the job<font color="#CCCCCC"> done in fact many teams</font>

100
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,620
already starting meetings today in the

101
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,509
hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead of me excellent and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve</font>

102
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,580
today is the second anniversary for the

103
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:51,099
new generic top-level domains program

104
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,469
and which happens also to have been the

105
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:55,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">first with the four domains being</font>

106
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,250
internationalized domain names how do

107
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,949
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the program has progressed so</font>

108
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,340
far and where are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we with that the</font>

109
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:05,740
internationalized domain names are a

110
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:09,940
very big deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's I'm glad that</font>

111
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:14,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've mentioned that and that's a key</font>

112
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:17,789
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> opening up the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet beyond its</font>

113
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:21,490
western and American roots to embrace

114
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:23,289
the entire globe so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're all</font>

115
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,270
proud of that and we're all very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

116
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:28,259
pleased to see that that aspect has been

117
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:32,799
successful on the generic names of

118
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:38,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">generika new TT entities in general that</font>

119
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,690
has been progressing it is almost

120
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:43,750
exactly a case of let a thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> flowers</font>

121
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,880
bloom and with the implication that

122
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:49,659
there will be some that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will do well and</font>

123
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:53,050
some less well the full results are not

124
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:56,139
in but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am seeing considerable pressure</font>

125
00:05:53,050 --> 00:06:00,060
for let's get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let's open up the</font>

126
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:03,279
next round as rapidly as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

127
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,110
personally of the mindset that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

128
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be careful like to take the lessons</font>

129
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,550
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there to be learned from</font>

130
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:12,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">that from the current experience but I</font>

131
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:15,270
understand and fully appreciate that we

132
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:18,840
should move forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all due speed</font>

133
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:21,549
and on the ID ins by the way here in a

134
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,520
Dublin one of the many<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we got</font>

135
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:28,990
done is we signed with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Catholic</font>

136
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:34,628
Church the dot Catholic top-level domain

137
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:36,729
in Chinese in Arabic in Cyrillic and of

138
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:38,489
course in Latin characters that was a

139
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:42,188
great

140
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:45,369
frankly use of the internationalized

141
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:48,009
domain name system for an institution

142
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:49,389
that's in many ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> universal so we're</font>

143
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:56,229
delighted<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this happened here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

144
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:57,909
Dublin and Steve in 2016 well 2016

145
00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:00,729
brings a new meeting strategy into

146
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:03,248
effect how will that impact the meetings

147
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:06,808
moving forwards and the community as

148
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:09,969
well quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work went into</font>

149
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:12,610
making the decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> to adjust the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way we</font>

150
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:15,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the meetings so in in some sense</font>

151
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,629
the broad scope of having three meetings

152
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:19,659
a year remains in place but we've

153
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:22,119
adjusted what to do during those

154
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:24,308
meetings and the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> change I'll</font>

155
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:25,509
have an a<font color="#E5E5E5"> meaning early in the year a be</font>

156
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:27,159
meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle of the year which</font>

157
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:30,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">is somewhat shorter and more focused</font>

158
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:33,459
with less of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> formalities and more</font>

159
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:36,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">working sessions and then AC meeting at</font>

160
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:38,649
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year that is got all of</font>

161
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:43,749
this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we usually do plus some</font>

162
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:45,849
outreach and attempt to communicate with

163
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:48,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">the with the rest of the world that does</font>

164
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:52,539
not normally pay attention to I can so

165
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:54,639
much as with any new program a lot of

166
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:56,919
thought goes into it and a lot of

167
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,740
organization and there's also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

168
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:02,198
amount of hope and waiting to see how it

169
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:06,689
works out so next year will be the test

170
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:08,979
and expect that we'll we'll find out

171
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:11,499
expecto so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll work well and expect</font>

172
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:13,628
we'll find some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will want to</font>

173
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:15,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">learn out of that it will cause some</font>

174
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:17,529
adjustments down at the second and third

175
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:19,509
levels of things I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> came out of a</font>

176
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:22,119
meeting in which saying okay how do we

177
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:26,499
fit one of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> programs into this and</font>

178
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:29,529
where does it fit smoothly in but<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

179
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:35,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this always brings a certain sense</font>

180
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:38,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">of renewed energy and thoughtfulness</font>

181
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:41,469
about how we operate and some very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

182
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:43,329
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and finding that</font>

183
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:45,910
brings us to maracas<font color="#E5E5E5"> which will be the</font>

184
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:49,120
first time this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an effect next year</font>

185
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:51,490
in in March how do you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

186
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,990
meeting and how important is it to take

187
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:58,529
place in Africa I am really<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

188
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:01,870
forward to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marrakech for three reasons</font>

189
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:03,970
one Marrakech will be a meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

190
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:06,820
Africa that will celebrate this great

191
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,610
continent a continent that is dear to me

192
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,310
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> also dear to many of us at ICANN who</font>

193
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,500
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I cans place in Africa is</font>

194
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:18,810
important and bringing together this

195
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:21,459
fast growing community into the fold in

196
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,680
every way we can is important Marrakech

197
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:26,079
will be a chance to do that to deepen

198
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,349
our roots in Africa and to connect with

199
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the African people at all levels we plan</font>

200
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,930
to bring high-level ministers we plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

201
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,360
bring businesses business

202
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:39,459
representatives from Africa we have

203
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,709
plans to also bring students from

204
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:43,839
various universities in Africa to the

205
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:46,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting so that this becomes a meeting</font>

206
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,940
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in Africa but about Africa the</font>

207
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:52,149
second reason Marrakech will be great is

208
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:55,300
because Marrakech maybe when we could

209
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:57,130
celebrate the multi-stakeholder models

210
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,920
delivery of a proposal to the US

211
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:02,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">government and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in itself is a huge</font>

212
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,920
celebration it's a triumph of our model

213
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:07,990
a model<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says that a public-private</font>

214
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,880
partnerships between governments and

215
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:13,839
businesses and users and civil society

216
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:16,089
work and they produce results and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

217
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,520
the work we've done to prepare<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this</font>

218
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:20,890
transition will culminate in delivering

219
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,930
a multi-stakeholder bottom-up consensus

220
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:25,209
proposal to the US government<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

221
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,279
complete our<font color="#E5E5E5"> independence and I hope</font>

222
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:30,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">that by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Marrakech we can all be</font>

223
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,290
celebrating very much the<font color="#E5E5E5"> delivery of</font>

224
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,260
that proposal and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course finally</font>

225
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:38,319
maracas will be my<font color="#CCCCCC"> last meeting as</font>

226
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,689
president and<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEO of I can and for me it</font>

227
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,959
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a chance to make sure that my</font>

228
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:50,050
successor can be handed and I can that

229
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:52,660
he or she can continue growing in the

230
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:55,270
same spirit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a spirit that is rooted</font>

231
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,060
in our principles of openness<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

232
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:00,310
inclusivity in our spirit of

233
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,199
Independence that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will hopefully be then</font>

234
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,150
closer

235
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,570
certainly the integrity of the system

236
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:09,790
end of the internet layer that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

to introduce him or her to our community

and to work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> him to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transfer all of</font>

240
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:21,819
the good will and capital we've built so

241
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,180
that he or she can continue in this

242
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:27,460
great endeavor a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work so just to</font>

243
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:30,729
wrap up any final words either one of

244
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:33,040
you would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say where we're</font>

245
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:36,490
sitting here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the conventions that are</font>

overlooking the river on a very calm and

peaceful morning with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Sun coming up</font>

248
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:45,900
and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it resonates with exactly the</font>

spirit coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of this meeting that</font>

difference in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tone of how we enter</font>

leading I can to a very good place a
