Joyce meant when he said when I die

Dublin will be written<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my heart</font>

43

Dublin's literary heritage is phenomenal

44
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,079
as you walked these streets between

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,690
footsteps of George Bernard Shaw poet WB

47
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,269
Yeats playwright Oscar Wilde and many

48
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:59,180
others in fact it was wild who once said

49
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:03,320
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may serve us well in the</font>

52
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,620
so let's hope that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the week ahead it</font>

53
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,350

00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,210
Dublin actually began last week with

79
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,029
some important meetings involving the

80
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:22,400
iono stewardship transition and let me

81
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:27,859
ask how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have been here since</font>

82
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:31,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">last week working on this now so for all</font>

85
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:39,650
work week so to speak I don't know about

<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font>

88
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,920
pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some of the fatigue so let</font>

89
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:50,750
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest that we all stand up and take</font>

00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:54,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">a stretch and get ready for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this the</font>

next half of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> working time</font>

95
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:21,650
doubt many of us are indeed focused on

96
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:24,469
this issue as our people all around the

97
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:26,419
globe we're being watched we're being

98
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:29,449
watched carefully and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely</font>

99
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:31,248
a turbulent time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's challenging</font>

everybody is challenging everybody in

101
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:36,289
this room it's challenging our

102
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:38,389
communities staff the board for sure and

103
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:41,779
it's also an opportunity it's also an

104
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:46,339
opportunity to show everyone how we work

105
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:48,289
together make no mistake the pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

106
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:51,259
on and the world is watching it's been

107
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:54,259
18 months since the US government asked

108

I can to facilitate a global multi

109

stakeholder meetings sequence of

110
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,819
meetings aimed at formulating a proposal

111
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:04,870
on how best to transition the iono

let me give you a glimpse of just how

117
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:19,849
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> work has gone into these efforts</font>

118
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:23,419
roughly 300 people have been involved

119
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:25,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">with working groups more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than 340</font>

meetings have been held and there have

121
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:31,909
been 25,000 mailing list exchanges and I

122
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:34,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">suspect many people here have actually</font>

123
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:37,248
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reach read every one of those</font>

this meeting I can't 54 is an important

129
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,900
milestone the finish line we believe is

130
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,340
now in sight the board has certainly

131
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,739
come together and is committed to

132
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:06,530
facilitate and support the community in

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,720
every way that we can and it's my

134
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,900
sincere hope that we all come together

135
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:16,880
in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> positive spirit that is punctuated</font>

by mutual respect even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to the public forum when we recognize</font>

164
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:44,650
some of our valued community leaders for

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:47,300
their tireless community contributions

166
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:49,880
another piece of business we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at some time on how we run these</font>

168
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,760
meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm told that we have 1800</font>

people or so checked in for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this meeting</font>

170
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,939
and some 371 session

171
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:06,618
is scheduled that's an extraordinary

172
00:09:01,939 --> 00:09:09,259
number there you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide showing</font>

173
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:14,739
the growth of meetings and attendees

174
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:17,209
over time we've grown quite a bit

175
00:09:14,739 --> 00:09:19,279
clearly our meeting strategy has to

176
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:20,988
evolve to keep up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the increasing</font>

177
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">number of attendees and escalating</font>

178
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:25,429
demand for sessions and this is true

179
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:29,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">even if we remain stable at the numbers</font>

180
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:31,999
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are now two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago the board</font>

181
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:34,159
formed<font color="#CCCCCC"> a meeting strategy working group</font>

182
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:35,959
with broad cross community membership

183
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,659
and after a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal of work and study</font>

184
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:41,209
in public comment this group came up

185
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:43,249
with a new strategy for icam meetings to

186
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:46,248
make more efficient use of our time and

187
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:50,149
to facilitate broader choices in where

188
00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:51,679
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold meetings the problem is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

189
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:53,509
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep having meetings this size will</font>

190
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,539
have to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to Dublin we</font>

191
00:09:53,509 --> 00:10:00,559
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do that would we we</font>

192
00:09:56,539 --> 00:10:02,449
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually in any case after great</font>

193
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,249
deal of work we came up with a new

194
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:06,108
strategy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more efficient use and</font>

195
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:08,929
I'll take a minute to go over this new

196
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:13,099
strategy which begins<font color="#E5E5E5"> with our next</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 55 in Morocco slide</font>

198
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:19,219
showing the framework so we have now a

199
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:22,639
differentiation among the types of

200
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:25,329
meetings we have we call them a B and C

201
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:28,939
were not very creative with our naming

202
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:33,049
the a meeting is comparable to what we

203
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:36,139
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the be meeting in June a</font>

204
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:39,289
middle of the year next year will be

205
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:44,509
curtailed and the C meeting will be

206
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:46,639
expanded the be meeting obviously will

207
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:49,519
be one in which we are not doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

208
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,799
things and in particular we won't have a

209
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,949
welcoming speech like this and a number

210
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:59,389
of other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> there'll be an</font>

211
00:10:54,949 --> 00:11:01,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity to interact and discuss any</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of these during the second public forum</font>

213
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:04,608
on Thursday the<font color="#CCCCCC"> board will have an</font>

that you may have about this or any

216
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:12,800
other topics and it will be interesting

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,019
seven days which will allow an
