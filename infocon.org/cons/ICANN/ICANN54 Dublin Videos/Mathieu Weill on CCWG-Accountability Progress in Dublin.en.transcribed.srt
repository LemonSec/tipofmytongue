conducted and I'm delighted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to report</font>

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,890
that this assessment is now complete and

that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have received a significant</font>

amount of support for the current

13
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:41,440
proposals there are still outstanding

14
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:45,190
issues to be resolved but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's been</font>

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,510
extremely positive to see how the group

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:51,030
is now very much in a collaborative mood

17
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,800
everyone is listening to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other and</font>

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,980
we've made some significant steps

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:00,248
forward in all of the items where

20
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:02,828
disagreement or various options were

21
00:01:00,249 --> 00:01:05,260
being considered so that's extremely

22
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:08,680
encouraging and we are cautiously

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,530
optimistic<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the outcome of this</font>
