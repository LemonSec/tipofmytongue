18
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,589
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we looked at it there over 50</font>

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,510
lawsuits working their way through

20
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:50,030
courts all around the world challenging

21
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:54,079
the way the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet handed out names</font>

22
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,149
and numbers and the Commerce Department

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,100
was then letting out the contract<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

24
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:59,589
domain names to a comedy called network

26
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:07,400
verisign and network solutions the heads

00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,510
were they liked by jon postel who ran

out<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use the USCS they weren't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

30
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:16,760
to each other and and then all these

31
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,560
lawsuits were going on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got visited</font>

32
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,030
by a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of companies who said look</font>

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,160
we'd like to invest in the internet we

34
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,930
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> his real potential here but</font>

35
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,130
there's no predictable environment for

36
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:29,690
it and so at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> point we then formed a</font>

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:34,160
framework for global electronic commerce

38
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:38,270
a report and within the course of about

00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:41,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">a year and a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> half we negotiated a number</font>

free of tariffs and also to protect

00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:55,310
copyrights on the internet and also to

44
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:58,010
recognize digital signatures as being

45
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:01,909
legal in all of the countries in a

46
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:05,230
common format and we also pass major

47
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:07,780
pieces of legislation in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US Congress</font>

48
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:10,110
to allow for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take off</font>

internet Tax Freedom Act

50
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,520
so that we kept taxation off of Internet

51
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,740
commerce we passed something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

allowed for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet telephony not to be</font>

could grow<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in a market riverway</font>

passed legislation to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect the</font>

copyrights from ratify the treaties and

58
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:37,079
for digital signatures and it was a time

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,320
in Washington<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was as</font>

60
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,650
partisan and divisive as the time we

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,829
have today in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact it was there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

62

been a government shutdown in the

dispute between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> White House and</font>

Congress and the Republicans in Congress

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,600
and it was leading<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to an attempt to</font>

66
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,459
actually impeach President Clinton by

Republicans in Congress so it wasn't

68

<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the friendliest environment</font>

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we managed to keep the internet</font>

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:12,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">legislation out of that politics and</font>

71
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:15,000
every bill we sponsored had leading

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,239
Republican support as well as Democratic

73

00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,150
copyrights and Spencer Abraham who was

78
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,760
involved with digital signals and soul

79
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,459
and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote we had passed with</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">seven-year 80 votes and in the Senate</font>

out of a hundred and two-thirds in the

82
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,989
house and so we were successful in

83
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,030
getting this done and we kept it on to

84
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,680
the radar<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact we even asked</font>

85
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,660
President Clinton not to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> his speeches or in the State of the</font>

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">Union speech because if he did we feared</font>

88
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,959
that it would become partisan that

89
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,790
people would feel they had to attack it

90
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,340
that he shouldn't take credit for this

91
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,970
it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something done across the</font>

92
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,530
whole government and it worked and at

93
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,390
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also went through the</font>

94
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,269
process to form I what eventually became

95
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,399
I can because we needed a vehicle that

96
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:13,590
could be global and remember at this

97
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,570
time there were more people on the mini

98
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,640
tell in France which was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> local French</font>

99
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,010
version of connectivity than they were

100
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,238
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the whole internet global</font>

101
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:24,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so the internet was still very</font>

102
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:29,599
small but we felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there needed to</font>

103
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:34,710
be some market driven quickly moving

104
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:37,260
vehicle that could embody the

105
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,570
marketplace and the multi stakeholders

106
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,090
in the internet but be recognized by

107
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,710
government so that legally they can

108
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,130
withstand legal challenges to what they

109
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:49,109
were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and after our common process</font>

110
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:52,650
and so on a year and a half<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can was</font>

111
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,900
born from that process and it was the

112
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">first of its kind organization in the</font>

113
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,280
world where you had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> private nonprofit</font>

114
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,200
organization recognized by governments

115
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,070
with governments playing an advisory

116
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,479
role now we did that because we felt

117
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that even though we were supporters of</font>

118
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,270
the United<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nations overall that the</font>

119
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,280
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to be market driven it</font>

120
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,109
needed to be bottoms up it needed to be

121
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,950
democratic and it needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move quickly</font>

122
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:22,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">and even though it may seem to you that</font>

123
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:25,229
the processes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're going through</font>

124
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,409
to make decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transition are</font>

125
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:29,729
slow the typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision-making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

126
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,310
International Telecommunication Union

127
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,990
takes about<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight to ten</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years so if</font>

128
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,780
you're taking a year and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> half that's</font>

129
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:40,620
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast compared to normal global</font>

130
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision-making and so we felt that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

131
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,740
internet would be better driven as a

132
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:50,130
multi-stakeholder model market-driven

133
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:52,020
then to have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a multi governmental</font>

134
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,090
body and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we felt that governments</font>

135
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,560
weren't the only stakeholders here the

136
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,869
sum of all governments were crucially

137
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,640
important it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> table they</font>

138
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">shouldn't be the only ones at the</font>

139
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:05,490
decision-making table so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how all</font>

140
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:07,789
this was born and I can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and if</font>

141
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,990
i look back again as somebody who then

142
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:12,599
went out of it because i felt that

143
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">having been behind the creation of it it</font>

144
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,229
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be wrong it would be like a</font>

145
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:19,979
conflict of interest to try to stay

146
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:23,340
involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i pulled back and did</font>

147
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:24,960
other things with my life but as I look

148
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,299
back now in the history of it and I

149
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,830
started become involved again in

150
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,940
Singapore when this process first

151
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,990
started because we had originally

152
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommended</font>

153
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,580
that eventually the US government should

154
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,440
give up its stewardship and that the

155
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,729
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a whole should hold the</font>

156
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,250
ultimate accountability that was

157
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,600
recommendation we made back in 1998

158
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,400
although we recognized it couldn't

159
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,710
happen immediately it would have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

160
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,229
time for I can to prove itself and

161
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:52,919
become a strong now if you take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

162
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:54,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">just as somebody who's a layperson look</font>

163
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,860
at what's happened to the internet right

164
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,930
i mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> the numbers of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> users have gone up</font>

165
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:05,480
orders of magnitude numbers of domain

166
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:10,410
names numbering hundreds of languages

167
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:12,650
you know Wi-Fi mobile devices now we're

168
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:16,290
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the Internet of Things and</font>

169
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:19,620
remarkably remarkably you never read

170
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:22,050
something about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet failing</font>

171
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,630
technically to accommodate all that

172
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,030
unbelievable growth and all that

173
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,710
diversity never read<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it why</font>

174
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">because of the people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are attending</font>

175
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,739
this conference and the people that

176
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:36,660
preceded them the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that run the</font>

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,430
basic activities the technical

178
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,370
activities in the technical coordination

179
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,650
of the internet have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to keep</font>

180
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,790
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all these amazing changes that</font>

181
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,549
have occurred and all this amazing

182
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:51,450
expansion and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet continues to</font>

183
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:54,210
run seamlessly that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> remarkable in the</font>

184
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:57,090
space of twenty years and<font color="#CCCCCC"> icons</font>

185
00:07:54,210 --> 00:08:01,590
existence what 16 17<font color="#CCCCCC"> years it's</font>

186
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:05,640
remarkable that that has happened so let

187
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:07,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">me just conclude what I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say by</font>

188
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:11,909
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've observed this process now</font>

189
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:14,670
for the past 18 months or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so and I'm</font>

190
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:16,830
very optimistic now as often with

191
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:19,140
consensus making processes it's had its

192
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:22,320
ups and downs and people yell at<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

193
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:26,940
other the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet community is not</font>

194
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,920
known for shy people and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

195
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:33,690
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of strongly held views a</font>

196
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:36,690
lot of arguments a lot of distrust it's

197
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:40,590
also not a community that<font color="#CCCCCC"> likes paranoia</font>

198
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:42,339
at times and so there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

199
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:45,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">back and forth</font>

200
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:47,930
which has been healthy I think but there

201
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,480
has been a bottoms-up process with

202
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:54,140
comments with lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people involved</font>

203
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,430
and I think it's 98 99 percent of the

204
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,810
way they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> now to achieving a</font>

205
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:01,670
consensus I think over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the coming days</font>

206
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,140
some people have strongly felt positions

207
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,360
particularly on the accountability

208
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,490
issues and so on are going to have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

209
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,560
willing to modify those positions some

210
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,380
but I think if the history<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

211
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">consensus process holds they'll do so</font>

212
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,300
and we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a common proposal that I</font>

213
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:20,240
hope will come in a matter of days but

214
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,729
certainly not too much into the future

215
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,700
and then at that point the community

216
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,230
will write up a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good cogent document</font>

217
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,209
that it can present to the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> government</font>

218
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,160
to hopefully follow through on the

219
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:32,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">transition and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gentleman will be</font>

220
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming up in later we're coming up to</font>

221
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stage after me we'll talk a bit</font>

222
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:40,910
about the process from there but i'm

223
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:43,339
very hopeful that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the consensus is just</font>

224
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,990
about there<font color="#CCCCCC"> i congratulate the committee</font>

225
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:49,250
chairs and others who've worked on this

226
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:51,560
it's been a monumental job to navigate

227
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,380
all of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> through and get it to this</font>

228
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,420
point of almost consensus and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

229
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,279
they'll finish the job<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the coming</font>

230
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,410
days and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm very optimistic about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

231
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:03,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm also optimistic i had a very brief</font>

232
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:06,469
chance to meet with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the staffs</font>

233
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,959
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm also optimistic that there is a</font>

234
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:14,060
bipartisan spirit in the US Congress

235
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:15,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this and I'm hopeful that that it</font>

236
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,079
will avoid the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of politics that are</font>

237
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:23,060
swarming around and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

238
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:26,000
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on its merits let</font>

239
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:31,310
me just finish by saying that I think

240
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's happening now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is historic you</font>

241
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:37,219
know if you look back at the way

242
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:40,550
societies evolved you know from going to

243
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:43,310
a hunter-gatherer economies to farming

244
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:46,579
and husbandry economy's going through

245
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:48,469
industrial economies those major

246
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:51,439
transitions in human history going back

247
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">8,000 years have all been accompanied by</font>

248
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,620
changes

249
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,940
in governance changes by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

250
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:01,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">societies function and although there's</font>

251
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:05,080
always two steps forward one step back

252
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:09,290
you see increasing democratization as

253
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:12,520
being evident at each stage and you see

254
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:15,199
that progress always has some<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost to it</font>

255
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,060
but that the technical progress always

256
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,120
leads to human progress in human

257
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:22,069
freedoms increases in human freedom

258
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,340
increases in the ability of people to

259
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,780
realize even more human potential the

260
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,760
internet revolution that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

261
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,579
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> now is as fundamental as the</font>

262
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:35,450
Industrial Revolution in remaking human

263
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:37,280
society and the governance model that

264
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:40,760
you all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been evolving now for the</font>

265
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:44,420
past however<font color="#E5E5E5"> many years in 16 17 years</font>

266
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:49,160
is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I think form a paradigm for</font>

267
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:51,349
models in the future of how democratic

268
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:55,819
Bottoms Up multi-stakeholder processes

269
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:57,170
can coordinate for human good and so I

270
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,900
think the work you're doing now is

271
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,990
historic I'm history so I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

272
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,949
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved directly in it but I</font>

273
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:07,220
congratulate<font color="#CCCCCC"> you on the progress you've</font>

274
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:09,080
made and I urge you to get to that final

275
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,090
point of consensus in the coming days

276
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,760
and then to follow it through I think

277
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:15,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's tremendous achievement something</font>

278
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,860
you'll always be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very proud of thank you</font>

279
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,860
very much

280
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,689
you
