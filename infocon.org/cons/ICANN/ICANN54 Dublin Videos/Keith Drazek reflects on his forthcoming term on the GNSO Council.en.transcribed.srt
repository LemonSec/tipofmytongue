00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,740
quite a dramatic change and it's

00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting that the dynamics within our</font>

26
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,850
accordingly we have now registries that

27
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:17,119
are not traditional registries in the

historical sense but that r dot brand

29

year 2000 so we've over the course of

42
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:54,079
many years I've had different jobs and

43

different roles within the i kin

registry operator who operated a ccTLD a

was representing that registry and that

ccTLD on the CC NSO<font color="#E5E5E5"> Council so I'm very</font>

49
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:16,220
exciting now to be moving to the gns<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font>

develop policy and it's a it's a

53
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,019
fascinating opportunity and there is a

54
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:31,190
significant difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CC</font>

55
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:34,790

56
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,859
actually comprised or composed of a

number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different individual</font>

stakeholder groups with their unique

59
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:45,170
interests and perspectives whereas the

60
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:48,410
CC NSO is largely a group of country

61
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,920
code registry operators each has its<font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font>

policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> development processes but they're</font>

63
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,459
significantly different in the way that

64
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,440
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are developed and certainly in</font>

issues that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the council will be dealing</font>
