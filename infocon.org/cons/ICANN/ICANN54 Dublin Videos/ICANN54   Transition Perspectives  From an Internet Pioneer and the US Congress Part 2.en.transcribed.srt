back specific proposals and then

ultimately we had an oversight hearing

thought II<font color="#CCCCCC"> shehadeh testified at and</font>

147
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:32,500
then we ultimately move the dot-com act

148
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:34,209
through our committee Jamie to get to

149
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,879
what you were to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> point about</font>

bipartisanship on a number of issues

we've also

152
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,469
the work that's been done there's been a

number of other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> in global</font>

those sorts of things and that has

166
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,190
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a bipartisan effort as well</font>

multi-stakeholder approach to

186
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,810
international internet government so I

187
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:59,440
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was what I was because we're</font>

the four of us disagree on quite a lot

190
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:06,340
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things basically then this is one</font>

191
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:10,050
issue which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually quite nice that</font>

192
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:13,359
all our bosses are actually United I

193
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:15,460
would say it's not the least one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

194
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,010
least contentious issues for our

195
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,919
committees yeah I could say in my

196
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">experience being here since January when</font>

197
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,790
we have hearings dealing with these

198
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,290
issues if you didn't see where people

199
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">where the different members were sitting</font>

200
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,740
physically in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room you wouldn't know</font>

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,440
which side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the aisle they were on</font>

202
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,669
that's been uniform and everyone has

203
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,440
been working together it's been great

204
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:40,478
<font color="#CCCCCC">all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right terrific</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so next question</font>

205
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,240
explain if you can your committees

206
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,440
relationship to<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA who's obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

big player<font color="#CCCCCC"> in all</font>

208
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,140
this both of our committees are the

209
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,910
so-called authorizing committees for the

00:08:51,910 --> 00:09:00,430
we have general oversight<font color="#E5E5E5"> role over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA</font>

212
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,530
that means as a practical that matter

213
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,709
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means you know MTI</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> A's governing</font>

statute the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA organization act is it</font>

215
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:09,970
was promulgated by our committee it is

216
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">amended by our committee when there's</font>

amendments made in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Congress and we</font>

00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,940
regularly conduct oversight over their

219
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,910
activities so we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

220
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,650
working relationship with<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

221
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,390
strengthened by trips like these where

222
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:25,180
we have a chance to coordinate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them</font>

223
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:27,400
on as US citizens necessarily as

224
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,370
legislative branch versus the executive

225
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,319
branch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the u.s. government and so in</font>

226
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,760
general we thought we've despite the

227
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,620
fact that we are you know often

228
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,390
portrayed as<font color="#CCCCCC"> their overseers we have a</font>

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:41,200
very collaborative<font color="#E5E5E5"> and collegial</font>

231
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned the dot-com act somebody</font>

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:47,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned calm act earlier there's a</font>

233
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,630
number of bills that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been floated</font>

234
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,319
in this Congress last<font color="#E5E5E5"> Congress dealing</font>

235
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:55,630
with the transition including the

236
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:59,830
dot-com<font color="#E5E5E5"> act including a spending bill</font>

237
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:03,100
that would seek to block the transition

238
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,390
transition from from taking place do you

239
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,580
have any perspectives on any of these

240
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:08,410
bills do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think any of them will have</font>

241
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,710
an impact or could have an impact will

242
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:13,150
have an impact I think you thought you

243
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,220
find that generally authorizing

244
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,600
committees prefer to to do the business

245
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,790
that's within the sphere of that

246
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:23,100
committee and so our preference would be

247
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:25,329
to conduct oversight and and you know

248
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,280
speak from a congressional perspective

249
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:29,020
through items<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the dot-com act</font>

250
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,689
rather through that rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than through</font>

251
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,220
policy writers<font color="#E5E5E5"> be positive just so</font>

252
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,240
people understand authorizing meaning

253
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:39,820
authorizing the work of and of the

254
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">Department of Commerce of actually</font>

255
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,280
creating the policies as opposed to the

256
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,000
committee's who make<font color="#E5E5E5"> spending decisions</font>

257
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,860
correct so the Energy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Commerce</font>

258
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,140
Committee and the Senate Commerce

259
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,880
Committee are the two authorizing

260
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,650
committees and our view is that those

261
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the appropriate committees to be to</font>

262
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">be speaking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on these</font>

263
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:59,500
there are there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> times when the</font>

264
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,270
appropriations committees need to get

265
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,950
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> but certainly at this juncture</font>

266
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,840
we think we're conducting a significant

267
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,150
amount of oversight as I mentioned

268
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">through letters hearings the dot-com act</font>

269
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:11,530
and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course several of us here at this</font>

270
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,920
meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so we feel as if we're we're</font>

271
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing what needs to be done yeah I think</font>

272
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,099
just to explain for anyone who doesn't

273
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,479
know it's generally there's two

274
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,770
different committees that can deal with

275
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,840
an agency there's the one that kind of

276
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,400
deals with I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think with the authorizing</font>

277
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,500
committee that deals with the policy and

278
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:30,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">then there's the other committee that</font>

279
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,990
deals with the money and in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> view I</font>

280
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,189
think as the people who we think just

281
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,570
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy we</font>

282
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,920
don't normally like it when the other

283
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,770
committee comes in and tries to use

284
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,199
money to enforce their policy that they

285
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:42,790
want so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our perspective I</font>

286
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,820
can speak for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the members i work for we</font>

287
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,599
see that calm act as an alternative to

288
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,220
anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going through the</font>

289
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,930
appropriations process yeah the

290
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,430
authorizing appropriating relationship

291
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,410
was once described to me when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got to</font>

292
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,910
the hill is the authorizers define the

293
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,010
cup and the appropriators tell you how

294
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,199
full to fill it and in this case

295
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes the appropriators decide the</font>

296
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,560
correct fill level is<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero I of course</font>

297
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:07,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">they wish they had our job of course but</font>

298
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,699
the reality is you know obviously calm

299
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,739
was originally a product of Energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

300
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,990
Commerce so I will say we feel some

301
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,640
pride of ownership for our members in

302
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that bill we're very proud of the way it</font>

303
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">turned out in the house and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the vote</font>

304
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we had and so that is obviously our</font>

305
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,790
preferred course so for our Senate

306
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:28,180
staffers any willingness to handicap the

307
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,670
chances of calm getting out of the

308
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:36,719
chamber we're certainly working very

309
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:40,959
hard to effectuate that okay great<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

310
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,960
Jeff your boss and senator Brian Schatz

timing of what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on with the</font>

00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:22,268
<font color="#E5E5E5">transition and the discussions he felt</font>

327
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:25,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this was an appropriate time to try</font>

and again state you know what he<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see out of a transition and that</font>

330
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:33,250
is to have a bottom-up process that

331
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:36,070
results in robust and significant

332
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,930
accountability reforms and that guards

<font color="#E5E5E5">against government capture those are the</font>

types of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he'll be looking</font>

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,850
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I believe a lot of members of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the Senate will be looking for when a</font>

when a proposal is ultimately put

338
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,390
forward and certainly on this issue of

339
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,100
government captured it's been something

340
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been it's been weighing on</font>

341
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,380
his mind for the entirety of the

342
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:58,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">transition you mentioned in 2014 he and</font>

343
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,420
senator Rubio waited on specific reforms

344
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:04,569
and it was at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that time that he said</font>

345
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:07,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">that he wanted to see it in the bylaws</font>

346
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:09,940
that that only gac advice by consensus

347
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:11,199
would be considered by the board that's

348
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,550
certainly something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

349
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,199
actively watching those proceedings

350
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,269
that's great what you anticipate my next

351
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:18,640
question which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you all hope</font>

352
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:23,500
to see in the final proposals to accept

353
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:27,130
it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would certainly reiterate what</font>

354
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,360
Jeff said my boss<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also very strongly</font>

355
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've said it at many of our</font>

356
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,820
hearings that there are sort of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

357
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to see out of this</font>

358
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,070
one is we're going to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

359
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:37,630
compliance<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the NTIA criteria and</font>

360
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,850
recently as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the process that</font>

361
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">started in 113th Congress we got a</font>

362
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,449
report back from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US government</font>

363
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:46,239
accountability office that discusses

364
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:48,609
sort of the domestic policy aspects of

365
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,980
the IANA transition one of the

366
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:53,529
recommendations they made was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ntia</font>

367
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,149
have a process in place that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

368
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:56,230
looked at and scrutinized for how

369
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:57,760
they're going to analyze this my

370
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,890
understanding is at NTIA is in the

371
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,800
process of doing so which review is a

372
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:06,370
really positive development so<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a</font>

373
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,250
really standards-based review

374
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,930
methodology for evaluating the proposal

375
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">yes so I mean we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really hoping to see</font>

376
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">a rigorous analysis of whatever</font>

377
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:16,899
proposals put in front of<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

378
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,589
again reiterate what Jeff said about

379
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:22,329
the role of<font color="#E5E5E5"> consensus in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the gac if if</font>

380
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:24,610
we are talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a multi-stakeholder</font>

381
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:26,050
system then we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually talking</font>

382
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,480
about a multi-stakeholder system where

383
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,689
only those groups that have produced

384
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,920
consensus are able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring something up</font>

385
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:36,368
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very important aspect for us as</font>

386
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,748
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I could say I</font>

387
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:39,279
mean the point just to follow up on the

388
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:41,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">point about consensus I think that</font>

389
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,990
that's completely consistent<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

390
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:46,990
positions that the Democratic members in

391
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,879
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> house have taken so far I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think what</font>

392
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:52,420
the members that I work for I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what</font>

393
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:55,540
they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be looking for is that it's what</font>

394
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,610
we get back is something that still

395
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,498
supports multi-stakeholder approach

396
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:01,360
approach has broad consensus and

397
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:02,860
definitely as I mean strong

398
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,619
accountability is very important

399
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:08,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody I would associate myself with</font>

400
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:10,089
the remarks of my colleagues I think I

401
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:15,519
think we're fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> United on that right</font>

402
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:17,589
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right okay so last question is</font>

403
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,259
sort of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hypothetical let's say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we get</font>

404
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:24,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the end of this process the proposals</font>

405
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:27,490
are submitted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia well sorry the</font>

406
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:30,849
proposals go through the chartering

407
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:34,540
organizations they get approved they go

408
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:39,730
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA NTIA finds that they meet the</font>

409
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:42,339
criteria and then sends them up to to

410
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,470
Congress for approval and let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

411
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:46,120
for whatever reason there's concerns

412
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,279
about the proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the Congress</font>

413
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:53,079
some someone thinks that there is a

414
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:55,029
potential for capture the for example if

415
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,349
that were to happen what<font color="#CCCCCC"> would you do</font>

416
00:16:55,029 --> 00:17:01,209
you have any sense of what Congress

417
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:03,879
could or would do if I mean I think

418
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:06,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why we're here is that we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

419
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:08,349
be involved and observing this process

420
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:11,648
and coordinating and working with<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA</font>

421
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:13,119
now and we're at ba and certainly since

422
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:15,010
they have announced<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ANA transition</font>

423
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,520
we're hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to avoid at all</font>

424
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:20,559
costs that happening and so I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

425
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">hard-pressed to imagine that we could</font>

426
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,908
get all the way through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process here</font>

427
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,730
in the multi-stakeholder system the

428
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:29,570
process of review at NTIA and just then

429
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,220
have these issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up</font>

430
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,439
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved at this stage means that</font>

431
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,330
we're being heard and and we're seeing

432
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that play out what the things that our</font>

433
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,019
bosses have raised in hearings are being

434
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,389
addressed you know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the stress</font>

435
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:43,340
tests that are being<font color="#E5E5E5"> done as a part of</font>

436
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:45,080
this process were things that were

437
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,459
raised in hearings at Energy and

438
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,220
Commerce and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's Senate Commerce and so</font>

439
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,809
I can't imagine that hypothetical coming

440
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,909
to fruition I think if there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

441
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:55,370
be some concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> members of Congress</font>

442
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:58,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's certainly plenty of time between</font>

443
00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:01,309
now and the time that a proposal is out

444
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:03,320
the other end of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA process for</font>

445
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:05,029
concerns to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be aired that's that's great</font>

446
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,799
to hear i mean good<font color="#CCCCCC"> I suppose that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

447
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:09,230
agree with that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean look we are close</font>

448
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,850
contact PTI we are attending these were

449
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,370
over here with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys right so I think</font>

450
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,559
we will keep I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think we would be</font>

451
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,389
surprised by anything I guess to the

452
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:21,678
larger community I would challenge all

453
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:24,469
of you to work really hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

454
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:30,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">together to present a plan that Congress</font>

455
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:31,850
cannot disagree with sir all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font>

456
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much had solved for my</font>

457
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:37,399
questions we got a time for a handful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

458
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:40,610
questions or<font color="#CCCCCC"> are mics in the in the</font>

459
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:44,168
aisles if anyone has any burning

460
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,168
questions on a Sunday evening

461
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:53,739
I have quick question I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kill</font>

462
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,609
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> in from doubled how much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

463
00:18:53,739 --> 00:19:01,959
bipartisan atmosphere and environment is

464
00:18:57,609 --> 00:19:04,359
down to ignorance from the legislators

465
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:06,279
my mean by that is that part I'm

466
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:07,599
speculating here that one of the reasons

467
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,919
that there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been agreement on the</font>

468
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:14,948
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because the politicians</font>

469
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:15,909
don't understand what it is I don't

470
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:17,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's the case with the</font>

471
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:19,509
Committees of jurisdiction I mean

472
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:21,938
<font color="#CCCCCC">certainly we've spent a lot of time our</font>

473
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:24,069
personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> time educating the membership</font>

474
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:25,929
of our committees about what I can is

475
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:29,109
and what it isn't what multi-stakeholder

476
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:31,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">ISM is and isn't and so the members of</font>

477
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:34,688
our committees are very well informed on

478
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:35,709
both sides of the aisle well once you

479
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:37,689
get out past the Committees of

480
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:39,069
jurisdiction perhaps the understanding

481
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:41,709
falls off a little bit but that's

482
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:43,209
frankly true of any issue that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> factly</font>

483
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:45,909
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for the committee system yes</font>

484
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:48,399
is so that members with jurisdiction

485
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:49,899
over the issue can get educated on the

486
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:52,658
issues and present a straightforward

487
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:54,129
process for getting there and to double

488
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:56,289
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why we're here I</font>

489
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:57,849
mean we're here to help our bosses our

490
00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:00,369
bosses can't be everywhere unfortunately

491
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:01,809
so we're here to help make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

492
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:03,399
see what goes on here to report back to

493
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:05,289
them what's happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I would also</font>

494
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:07,059
say I mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we've had a</font>

495
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:09,969
number of hearings of this in our

496
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:13,599
subcommittee on this where we bring in

497
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:14,679
very educated witnesses body's been

498
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,609
there a number of times later

499
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,549
Strickland's been there a number of

500
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:21,009
times and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way those hearings have</font>

501
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:24,399
been going they're not partisan showcase

502
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:26,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">affairs they are educational and the</font>

503
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:28,899
members have been very interested and

504
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:31,509
dig into the issues and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're</font>

505
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:33,129
fairly well-educated when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've brought</font>

506
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:34,629
in witnesses for our hearings it's not

507
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:36,728
just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know don't Iran we like</font>

508
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:38,168
assistant secretary<font color="#CCCCCC"> Strickling and fadi</font>

509
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:40,389
well enough but we've also brought in

510
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:41,679
stakeholders we had intellitec hearing i

511
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:43,389
sock has been at a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

512
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,579
hearings we've had we've had groups that

513
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:47,708
are all part of this process come in to

514
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:49,688
speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> directly to our membership and</font>

515
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:52,679
tell them exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going on</font>

516
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:54,699
exactly what they should care about so

517
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,459
yeah it would make my life a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

518
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:59,270
easier if there was more ignorance

519
00:20:56,459 --> 00:21:01,920
fortunately

520
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:04,410
anyway any other question I'm sorry yes

521
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:09,060
sir I've got two questions for you guys

522
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:13,650
the first is how concerned are your

523
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:15,929
bosses with the possibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the Ted</font>

524
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:19,340
Cruz amendment to the dot-com<font color="#CCCCCC"> Act which</font>

525
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:22,200
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> require approval by Congress</font>

526
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:24,230
getting included in the legislation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

527
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,450
finally comes out of the Senate House

528
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:31,770
reconciliation process and my second

529
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:34,970
question is again what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are your feelings</font>

530
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:38,480
or can you express what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think your</font>

531
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:41,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">boss's feelings are in regards to the</font>

532
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,680
probability<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this full transition</font>

533
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:48,000
effort getting sucked in up into the

534
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:51,410
vortex of the 2016 election cycle given

535
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,030
that at least two<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Republican</font>

536
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:57,180
potential candidates have come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

537
00:21:54,030 --> 00:22:01,580
opposition<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this so far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

538
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:03,990
two questions one<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cruz amendment to the</font>

539
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:07,830
interaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the proposals and</font>

540
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:09,330
the presidential campaigns well with

541
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,730
regard to Senator Cruz's amendment

542
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:13,860
senator Cruz is a member<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Commerce</font>

543
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:16,500
Committee and and he worked through our

544
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:19,199
markup process to offer an<font color="#E5E5E5"> amendment in</font>

545
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:22,770
good faith and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Senator</font>

546
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,860
Thune certainly you know acknowledges

547
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:27,360
some of his concerns and and he went

548
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,820
through the process offers amendment

549
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,159
that amendment ultimately failed and the

550
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,870
the amendment the version that was

551
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">reported out of our committee was</font>

552
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:37,379
identical to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of dot-com that</font>

553
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,270
passed the House of Representatives<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

554
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,790
that's the version that will be trying

555
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:43,940
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass and have been trying to pass</font>

556
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:46,170
with regard to the 2016 election I

557
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,140
assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're referring to senator Rubio</font>

558
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:51,420
and senator Cruz senator Cruz has some

559
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,790
concerns about the IANA transition and

560
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,850
certainly those are well publicized<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

561
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:59,220
think senator Rubio is not quite in that

562
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:01,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">position if I'd want to characterize his</font>

563
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,120
position too much but he certainly been

564
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,070
involved in a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> governance</font>

565
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,159
issues going back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think 112</font>

566
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:10,350
Congress and so how much this gets

567
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,520
caught<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in the 2016 politics you know</font>

568
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't know there's no shortage of</font>

569
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,809
issues

570
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:19,840
out there for people to talk about and

571
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:22,049
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have to wait and see all</font>

572
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,049
right

573
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:32,430
good afternoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christopher wilkinson</font>

574
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:34,810
thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your wisdom and your an ox</font>

575
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:39,070
historically I was partly responsible

576
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:42,690
for the present balance between the

577
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:48,179
multi-stakeholder system in icon and

578
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:51,790
including the government's advisory role

579
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:54,370
basically I set this up in Europe with

580
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:57,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">IRA magazine in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> United States at the</font>

581
00:23:54,370 --> 00:24:01,959
time all I would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say is that</font>

582
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:06,480
from what you say some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your members</font>

583
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:10,650
are being unnecessarily alarmist about

584
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:14,460
government capture that is not the issue

585
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:19,180
yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> fatty gave a lecture about</font>

586
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:22,980
including<font color="#E5E5E5"> capture problem of capture is</font>

587
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:25,180
multi-stakeholder you've got to have a

588
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:29,310
balanced throughout the system

589
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:29,310
throughout the<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization including</font>

590
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:38,560
commercial and industrial participants

591
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:42,490
so please cool this down there is no

592
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:46,120
risk of government capture there is a

593
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:47,940
very healthy balance between governments

594
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,860
and the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the multi-stakeholder</font>

595
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:55,750
system and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should continue and I</font>

596
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:57,909
ask you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to support it I would just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

597
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:59,740
response say I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we all are in</font>

598
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:01,960
agreement with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we think the</font>

599
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">system the balance that exists now</font>

600
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,740
between governments and other

601
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,420
stakeholders and I can is isn't

602
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,070
appropriate balance and I wouldn't

603
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,770
characterize my bosses as alarmists

604
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:14,439
because I'd lose my job but<font color="#E5E5E5"> besides that</font>

605
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:18,220
you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's real concern</font>

606
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,750
and that concern should be addressed and

607
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,160
I'm I applaud everyone in the

608
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,620
multi-stakeholder community for the work

609
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:29,410
they're doing to address those concerns

610
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:31,280
founded or otherwise thanks Steve thanks

and have been privileged to be a witness

614
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,179
in some of the hearings that you've

615

any perceptions in this room the judging

617
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:46,550
by the questions asked by your bosses

618
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:48,950
that there's a lack of awareness because

619
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:51,320
I would encourage anyone to attend a

620
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:53,900
meeting or two with congressional staff

621
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,389
as they drill into hundreds of pages of

622
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,100
detail and ask every witness a lot of

623
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,780
questions long before the cameras are

624
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,360
running in the hearing room and the

625
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:05,120
report language that these gentlemen put

626
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,399
together to support everything that

627
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,949
comes before their committees reveals an

in-depth understanding of the internet

629
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,890

634
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,210

<font color="#CCCCCC">they seem to do it Bravo well in the</font>

and to avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> late-inning the.com AG with</font>

643
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:45,379
this in to your credit and resisted all

of that dr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac is so clean and then</font>

648
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:57,170
consensus recommendations for the

transition as well as the accountability

650
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:03,260
part well then Congress is in a position

651
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,540
to endorse the transition that's the

652
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,770
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> help it can be and finally on the</font>

653
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,629
notion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of capture you don't know how</font>

654
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:11,240
right you are worrying about capture but

655
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:13,550
it's not necessarily some notion that

656
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,160
governments will take<font color="#CCCCCC"> over but it's it's</font>

657
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:17,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the notion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if the government's</font>

658
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,400
changed the way they make decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

659
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,429
you're allowed to do that well then

660
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,740
these new advice that comes over would

661
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:26,810
embroil I came in to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work out a</font>

662
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,610
mutually acceptable solution between

663
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:31,399
some governments who were for the advice

664
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a whole lot of other governments who</font>

665
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,950
are against

666
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,899
so it's a disaster thing to put I<font color="#E5E5E5"> cans</font>

667
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,909
board in a position of negotiating

668
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:41,518
between governments enough sovereign

669
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:44,639
powers and want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have their interest</font>

670
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:47,549
respected I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very wise to pay</font>

671
00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:50,399
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you have of avoiding in a</font>

672
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:52,139
situation where if<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments move to</font>

673
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:55,168
something less than consensus that

674
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:57,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're contentious opinions don't</font>

675
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:59,279
embroil I can or captured I can into a

676
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:01,860
process of<font color="#E5E5E5"> working out a negotiation</font>

677
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,710
among governments I can doesn't do that

678
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,449
maybe the UN does so let them worry

679
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,279
about that but don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make I can into a</font>

680
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,259
mini um to work out differences among

681
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:16,409
governments thank you again for all your

682
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:17,700
effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks yeah I'll respond to Steve</font>

683
00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:20,070
a little bit too you know Steve thank

684
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,409
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for your kind words and thank</font>

685
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:24,840
you for your sage testimony when you

686
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:28,590
come to the committee you know we come

687
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:30,689
from a body that where the two sides of

688
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:32,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">an argument</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fail to reach consensus we</font>

689
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't get to have any output if the</font>

690
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:37,080
House and Senate can't agree on language

691
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,549
in a conference as it turns out we don't

692
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,820
get to put it forward to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the president</font>

693
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:43,710
so we certainly can understand the

694
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,320
frustration that that brings but that

695
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:53,159
process is what we are used to living

696
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:54,600
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right last question hi my name</font>

697
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:59,429
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jordan Carter and one of the</font>

698
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:01,889
reporters on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the CC WG process and one</font>

699
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:04,250
of the downsides are outside to that is

700
00:29:01,889 --> 00:29:07,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you get stuck at a lot of detail a</font>

701
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:09,000
lot of detail a lot of meetings and and

702
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,459
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys have a very different</font>

703
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,500
perspective coming from outside from a

704
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,080
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of political governmental context</font>

705
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,409
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question I would find it really</font>

706
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to know the answer to is in</font>

707
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:22,710
observing this

708
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:25,320
that's so far where we've got to what

709
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:28,429
have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most surprising in the</font>

710
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,428
conclusions that we've reached

711
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:41,930
so speaking from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level as you</font>

712
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:44,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">say not the details I actually think the</font>

713
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:45,920
whole process<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been impressive it's</font>

714
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,020
the people in this room you've done it

715
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:51,590
incredibly it's you've made so much

716
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:55,220
progress it's been such<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great job and</font>

717
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:58,310
I mean as we were hearing we're so so

718
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:00,950
far along<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just I don't know</font>

719
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:02,780
the the multi-stakeholder approach is a

720
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,490
little overwhelming when you first

721
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,500
approached it and to see how well that

722
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,110
everybody has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to get there I</font>

723
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,100
think so again did your description and

724
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,229
we're at the high level rather than the

725
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,939
details<font color="#CCCCCC"> and avoid getting into details I</font>

726
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,520
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the progress has been really</font>

727
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:19,730
impressive I think for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

728
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:22,040
surprising thing I mean we get paid to

729
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:24,020
sit in meetings and work out policy

730
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,460
decisions most of the people that

731
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:28,250
participate in this process this is a

732
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:30,620
side gig and in some cases an unpaid

733
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,270
side gig and I think the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressive</font>

734
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:35,360
thing to me the most surprising thing is

735
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:37,370
a level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of passion and a level of</font>

736
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,379
involvement from folks that don't

737
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:41,540
necessarily have skin in the game other

738
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">than being internet users I think that's</font>

739
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,750
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most surprising thing to me and it</font>

740
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:46,520
has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> throughout my involvement in</font>

741
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:49,520
the I can process this isn't my first I

742
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:51,410
can meeting and every meeting it seems

743
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,170
to be more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more impressive how many</font>

744
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:55,400
people are involved and care<font color="#E5E5E5"> and want to</font>

745
00:30:54,170 --> 00:31:00,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a part of this process that's the</font>

746
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:01,880
most surprising thing to me all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

747
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:06,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay now this is really the last</font>

748
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:08,240
question thank you and I think I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

749
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,940
speak in English because even if we have

750
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,340
the interpretation you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> etc</font>

751
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:16,130
yeah you can read but I it's not the

752
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:18,610
same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to use the good tools we</font>

753
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:23,110
are in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization to ABS</font>

754
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:25,550
interpretation and thank you your last

755
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:28,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">world was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting because I</font>

756
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:32,110
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to take into account in</font>

757
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:34,060
all that end user and I am one of them

758
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:36,879
here is a soggy

759
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:40,149
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> those three billion users</font>

760
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,460
need to know where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will go and how</font>

761
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:44,790
will go and I have sometimes the

762
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:47,290
impression today as impression that

763
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:51,220
sorry guys but I don't understand what

764
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:54,159
you are how you are g'nite i am not a US

765
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:57,910
citizen I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> NOT than a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

766
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:59,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are telling us to do we have trouble</font>

767
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,900
to understand why we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

768
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,780
because at the end of the day what it's

769
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:09,250
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> it such a well we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree on</font>

770
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:13,660
what we want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but the last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

771
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:17,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">who will say it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Congress I I was</font>

772
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:20,140
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was something else it</font>

773
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:24,220
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a community that need to be agree on</font>

774
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:26,410
then my question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how you want to</font>

775
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,720
reconcile that because the impression i

776
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:31,330
have here is that you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the last</font>

777
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,090
one you<font color="#E5E5E5"> your ganization yo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so Congress</font>

778
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:36,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be the last one to rather say</font>

779
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:38,919
that's my first question<font color="#E5E5E5"> my second</font>

780
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:42,250
recommendation you need to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

781
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,810
government with a gag because this the

782
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:47,290
community working group on

783
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:50,590
accountability will not be the right

784
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:53,200
place to negotiate what the government

785
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:56,199
advisory<font color="#E5E5E5"> committee as right to do within</font>

786
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,330
this organization if you have requests

787
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,160
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope that you would convince the</font>

788
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:02,889
gag that that will agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

789
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">request don't ask the end user to be in</font>

790
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:10,240
the middle of that because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not our</font>

791
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:11,950
role thank you I mean I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to try I</font>

792
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,750
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that any of us seem to</font>

793
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:16,090
believe that Congress has the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last say</font>

794
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:18,730
in this but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an interesting thing</font>

795
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:22,090
for the worldwide multi-stakeholder

796
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:24,010
community to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a small vision into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

797
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:26,590
inter-government the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Intergovernmental</font>

798
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:28,150
process of the United States because

799
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,379
ultimately what's happening here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

800
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,580
there's a process that's occurring the

801
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,530
multi-stakeholder system but there's

802
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,960
also an intra US government process

803
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:36,370
that's going on and I don't envy him

804
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,750
this role but assistant secretary

805
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:40,830
Strickling is sitting right in between

806
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:43,600
those two processes and it's a very

807
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:44,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult place to be and and like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

808
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,469
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think any of us want his</font>

809
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,889
job right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now but there is a process</font>

810
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,630
that

811
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:51,670
he has to go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> within our own</font>

812
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,800
government that includes being

813
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:56,770
responsive to the authorizing committees

814
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:59,680
on Capitol Hill that ultimately fund his

815
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:00,820
agency and so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I would</font>

816
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,550
characterize it as the United States

817
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:06,429
Congress having<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last say in the</font>

818
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:08,230
multi-stakeholder system<font color="#E5E5E5"> however we do</font>

819
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:11,409
have an affirmative oversight role over

820
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:13,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">NTIA and and that has what has been our</font>

821
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:15,460
role in this process writ large and I

822
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:16,928
think we've been pretty clear my members

823
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,300
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty clear and reiterating</font>

824
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:23,470
that whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a hearing that our</font>

825
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:24,820
job is to oversee<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia an NT I a's job</font>

826
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:28,480
is to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the multi-stakeholder</font>

827
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:30,760
representative at these events I don't

828
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,780
for one want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the one to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> represent</font>

830
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,409
multi-stakeholder system I don't think

831
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:37,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would desperately the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:44,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we are seen and heard</font>

835
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:52,658
a part of what we do that makes sense

836
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:54,760
all right Jeff John David and David
