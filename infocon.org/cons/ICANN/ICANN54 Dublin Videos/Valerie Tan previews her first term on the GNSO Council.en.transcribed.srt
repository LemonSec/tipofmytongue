gns or counsel from nominating committee

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,119

as a law student and then during<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

13
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,199
was this great institution that churned

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,620
out rules you know that allowed the

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,289
internet to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfectly when I join a</font>

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,459

opportunity to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work with I can on</font>

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,469

<font color="#E5E5E5">telecoms and Internet technology sectors</font>

20
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,670
that quickly became a you know great

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,950
piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the work that I did</font>

22
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:09,990
and when I can expend it and globalized

00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,210
around the world setting up its

24
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,570
Singapore hop I then had more of an

25
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,030
opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> become engaged as a</font>

26
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,339
business stakeholder and one fine day

27
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,970

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">not be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boring and so I did and so I'm</font>

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,960
here and I'm very<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad to be here it's</font>

33
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">really an eye-opener for me these couple</font>

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,149
of days some you know being in various

35
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,548
workshops of the genus or<font color="#CCCCCC"> council and</font>

36
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,640
you know I do realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really have a</font>

37
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:50,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of what to do to you know get up to</font>

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,560
speed with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> various working groups</font>

39
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,710
with the various transition projects and

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,880
there's so much important work ahead

41
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,729
well we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very glad to have you here</font>

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,219
thank you and you mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> briefly that</font>

43
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:06,600
you are from Singapore do you think

44
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:08,910
you're obviously bring a certain aspect

45
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,919
diversity to the two I can end the tuna

46
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,329
so do you think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's important and</font>

47
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,859
if so

48
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:18,410
mine yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think one of the challenges I</font>

49
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:22,040
guess facing the organization going

50
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:26,769
forward is really diversity or you know

51
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:30,170
divergent or diverse views I mean given

52
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:34,250
various projects that ongoing like the

53
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:36,320
you know new GTL<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD rounds and a iana</font>

54
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,110
stewardship transition<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess we're</font>

55
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,049
looking at space in the internet that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

56
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a lot larger where they're</font>

57
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,210
going to be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> stakeholders more</font>

58
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,579
communities that have not yet in you

59
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:52,700
know present<font color="#E5E5E5"> now taking part in the</font>

60
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:55,760
multi-stakeholder model process so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

61
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,790
think it's important because especially

62
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,100
coming from Asia and the region where

63
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:04,160
we're seeing almost I've just<font color="#CCCCCC"> received</font>

64
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:07,609
some new statistics that more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than about</font>

65
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">fifty percent of you know users on the</font>

66
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet now come from the asia-pacific</font>

67
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:15,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">region so from a policy and building</font>

68
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:19,480
perspective I think that part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

69
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:22,550
work is has has a lot of scope for

70
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,160
representation in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the future</font>

71
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,989
years ahead this is the first time I

72
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,900
read that you are on the genus or

73
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:31,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">Council as a noncom appointee and what</font>

74
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,480
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you expect for you to your term what</font>

75
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:38,989
do you think is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> license tool for you</font>

76
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,690
so one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have come to take</font>

77
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:43,790
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the couple of days having been</font>

78
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:47,239
you know involved really ingenious or

79
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">council discussions is that I'm assured</font>

80
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,330
of myself that it will not be a boring

81
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:54,709
appointment I mean there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so much</font>

82
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:59,330
intellectual stimulation I mean it's

83
00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:03,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">just the topics and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that there</font>

84
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:05,260
can be varying perspectives and also the

85
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,230
possibility i think you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

86
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:11,209
discussions where at some point in time

87
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:13,609
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know people agree to disagree and</font>

88
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:18,079
then come to a consensus and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

89
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:20,810
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because the the</font>

90
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,450
work of the gns or council is

91
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,660
to manage the policy development process

92
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:29,750
and the community looks to counsel for

93
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,120
that leadership role<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right</font>

94
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,650
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you very much for your time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

95
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,630
