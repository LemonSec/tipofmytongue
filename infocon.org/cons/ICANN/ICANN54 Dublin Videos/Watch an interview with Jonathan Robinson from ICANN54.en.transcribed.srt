genus oh and the stated it in at the

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,820
state in many ways I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done a</font>

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,939
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that things</font>

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:33,490
operate smoothly and that we work in an

12
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:35,290
effective way and that that goes through

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,900
many different layers that's in terms of

14
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,490
the personal relationships with between

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the councillors through to our</font>

16
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">understanding of each other's</font>

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,510
constituencies and stakeholder groups

18
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:48,490
knowledge of processes and procedures

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,290
effective working with staff so feels to

20
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:54,130
me that we're in pretty good shape and I

21
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:57,010
feel proud<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be handing over the the</font>

22
00:00:54,130 --> 00:01:00,160
chair of a oven a critical<font color="#CCCCCC"> organ in the</font>

23
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:02,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">icon infrastructure to a successor chair</font>

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,649
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good shape just over</font>

25
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,990
the past three years<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so the changes</font>

26
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:10,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">have taken place what brings to mind</font>

27
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,729
mostly for<font color="#E5E5E5"> USD as the chairs reflect</font>

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,439
back I think the overarching theme we

29
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:17,049
tried to put in place at you know

30
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:19,449
probably three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago was to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

31
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:22,119
a process<font color="#E5E5E5"> of continuous</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> improvement and</font>

32
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:25,049
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing so we looked at a number of</font>

33
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:29,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">different areas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was was in terms of</font>

34
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,600
the underlying processes what we with

35
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:33,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">within this the operating procedures of</font>

36
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,740
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which the council manages the</font>

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,630
policy how we could do any of those

38
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,710
things more efficiently or more

39
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:43,390
effectively for example when we now do

40
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,339
the preparation of an issue report we

41
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,859
put a draft charter in there that the

42
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,899
council is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not obliged to accept that</font>

43
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:51,880
has the opportunity to accept if the

44
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:54,490
council accepts that we end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

45
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,100
more efficient start to the PDP process

46
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,600
what is the what's the secret sauce if

47
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want what is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there what makes the</font>

48
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,408
council working tick we've concentrated

49
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,880
on a number of different areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

50
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:05,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">concentrated on where we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> improve</font>

51
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,630
those processes and where we can get

52
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:09,699
greater throughput we've concentrated on

53
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,769
how we might best rely on the staff that

54
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,510
support<font color="#CCCCCC"> the council and the staff are</font>

55
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,640
able to take on significant amount of

56
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,200
work provided<font color="#CCCCCC"> we trust and have an</font>

57
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,079
effective working relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,849
the staff we need to have good

59
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">interpersonal relationships between</font>

60
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:25,510
those counselors because we're often

61
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,459
dealing with quite contentious matters

62
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,099
and so one of the things we've done is

63
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:32,980
concentrated on making sure when we know

64
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:34,988
and understand one another from both a

65
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,209
constituency and stakeholder group level

66
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:38,920
we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and understand the way in which</font>

67
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,260
the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> groups work in which they</font>

68
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,109
come to decisions and in which in which

69
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,000
they empower the<font color="#E5E5E5"> counselors to work but</font>

70
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,069
also we've spent some time out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,390
council meetings getting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know one</font>

72
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:51,130
another and making sure we know and

73
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,018
understand each other<font color="#CCCCCC"> as individuals</font>

74
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,150
what are you thoughts for the air for

75
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:57,549
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> incoming chair I feel like I'm</font>

76
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,930
handing over something in good shape but

77
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:00,579
that doesn't mean there isn't lots of

78
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,860
work to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think one of the</font>

79
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:06,880
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key areas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that might help</font>

80
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:09,040
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be to start to think of the work of</font>

81
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the council as being managed and and</font>

82
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,420
handled by not only the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheddars need to</font>

83
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,340
stand alone the chairs got to vice

84
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,099
chairs and the chairs got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a competent</font>

85
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,630
policy staff so I think the critical

86
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:21,730
thing to do because one of the key

87
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,700
challenges is dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a high and</font>

88
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:27,310
increasing volume of work is to pull

89
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,548
together with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vice chairs and the</font>

90
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,010
support staff and see that as that the

91
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:36,910
team through which<font color="#CCCCCC"> that increased</font>

92
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:39,130
throughput is generated chosen thank you
