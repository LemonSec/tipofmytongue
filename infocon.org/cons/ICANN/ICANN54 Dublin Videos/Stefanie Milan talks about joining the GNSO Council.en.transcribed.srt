entity<font color="#E5E5E5"> G does and who represents yeah so</font>

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,439
I'm a<font color="#CCCCCC"> representative of the NCS G which</font>

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,630
is the non-commercial stakeholder group

11
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,160
on the genus or<font color="#CCCCCC"> council the</font>

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,250
non-commercial stakeholder group is

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,559
composed by two constituencies one is

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:42,320
the NC you see the non-commercial user

15
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:45,968
constituency and the other is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> n park</font>

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,789
the non-profit organization concern

17
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:52,070
constituency they might seem similar I

18
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:54,620
to some extent we do share a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

19
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,109
concerns but we represent slightly

20
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,510
different social groups if you want in

21
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:02,449
that NC you see is open to both

22
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:05,179
organizations like for example NGOs and

23
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:08,450
the individuals whereas the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end park</font>

24
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,880
represents only organizations more

25
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:14,960
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> park represents the</font>

26
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,140
interest of organization that might want

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,770
of have<font color="#E5E5E5"> registered domain name whereas</font>

28
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:26,210
MC you see that I that's let's say my

29
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:28,460
first family in the end CSG as a

30
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,908
slightly broader agenda and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we care</font>

31
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:34,070
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a number of other issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

32
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:36,170
can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what the issues are broadly</font>

33
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,089
speaking will look for example privacy

34
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,450
without the implication of names and

35
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,070
numbers for individuals and<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups</font>

36
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,979
privacy then we look we care about

37
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:49,039
development human rights but also the

38
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:51,590
diversity<font color="#CCCCCC"> and consumer choice ok very</font>

39
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">good thank you and you talk about</font>

40
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:57,710
individuals who are engaged with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NC</font>

41
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:59,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">UCM the nchs as well how do they how can</font>

42
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,820
they get in best involved with icon in

43
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,159
the genus oh oh it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually quite easy</font>

44
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,469
as we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can is pretty open</font>

45
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,860
everything is recorded and it can also

46
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:12,560
be followed remotely so the best way to

47
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,510
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved is to you know jump in a</font>

48
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,880
working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example there's plenty</font>

49
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:20,030
this always shortage of individual

50
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,700
especially and from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> non commercial</font>

51
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:26,330
site because we usually have also other

52
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:29,780
daily jobs and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're always happy to</font>

53
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,130
welcome other volunteers to help us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

54
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,360
fight for the issues that i just

55
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:39,380
described it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning</font>

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's say because indeed the issues are</font>

57
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">relatively complex especially for a</font>

58
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,970
newcomer there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of help both</font>

59
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,770
from the icon stuff and from other

60
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,960
individual organizational members to get

61
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,660
you by if you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to dive into</font>

62
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,220
icon is that how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you joined to did you</font>

63
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,440
did you just jump in or did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

64
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,770
slightly different path to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved</font>

65
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:06,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">I actually was was jumped in in that</font>

66
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:08,360
well I used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work for a government at</font>

67
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:11,900
some point and I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I can actually</font>

68
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:15,740
through guck although I<font color="#E5E5E5"> only lasted for</font>

69
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:18,350
a meeting but in this meeting I met some

70
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:21,590
and see you see members and that sort of

71
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:24,769
prompt me through getting boat and as

72
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,560
the first move they proposed to nominate

73
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:30,290
me for one of the position in the

74
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,670
executive<font color="#E5E5E5"> committee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on an cuc which is</font>

75
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,859
some actually something that i recommend

76
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,109
because it gives you a role and give you

77
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">some tasks which are allowed over mostly</font>

78
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:42,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">administrative and the possibility of</font>

79
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,630
being forced to learn let's say so doing

80
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,060
your forthcoming term here on the

81
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,160
council what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hot</font>

82
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,800
topics going to be for the NCS<font color="#E5E5E5"> G and you</font>

83
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,740
personally as well well i'm interested

84
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,510
in privacy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now to protect users</font>

85
