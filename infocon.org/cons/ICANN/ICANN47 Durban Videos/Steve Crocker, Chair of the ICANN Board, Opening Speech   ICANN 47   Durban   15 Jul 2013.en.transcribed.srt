pleasant the weather is in what is been

58
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:43,560
reputed I'm familiar considerably

hemisphere we've just left spring and

it's a long way<font color="#E5E5E5"> away but coming here</font>

65
00:03:53,489 --> 00:04:01,980
spring is coming sooner which is a sort

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,590
of hokey way of getting to the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

reauthorization and

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,009
and I can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> them not only intensively</font>

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,739
focused internally but also looking

sideways at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the at each other's</font>

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:36,740
organizations and even a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little small</font>

78
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:39,360
sense of competition for for attention

79
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,699
there's much to say about each of them

80
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,729
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll only take a moment to mention</font>

81
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this time is the 10th</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anniversary</font>

84
00:04:50,610 --> 00:05:07,469
the very as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said being here in Africa</font>

85
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:09,090
has caused me to put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> an idea</font>

86
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:12,300
that it's been gelling in my mind for a

87
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:14,429
while there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of rhetoric</font>

88
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:18,210
around the requirements for

89
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,669
accountability and transparency and we

90
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,489
have formal processes to review and I'm

91
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:25,020
in fact on the the current incarnation

92
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,270
of the accountability and transparency

93
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:31,289
review team all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

94
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,758
extraordinarily important but it caused

95
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">me to think some time ago that</font>

96
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,159
accountability transparency although

97
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:39,449
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely essential are not</font>

98
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:40,770
sufficient we could be accountable we

99
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:43,319
could be transparent we could be

100
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:45,568
ineffective we could be getting nothing

101
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,300
done and so for some time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been</font>

102
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:53,690
talking about effectiveness and

103
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:56,690
efficiency as essential as well and the

104
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:59,310
we have to we have to get the job done

105
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,349
we have to we have to be effective at

106
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,560
what we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to do it with a</font>

107
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:08,490
reasonable<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of efficiency one can</font>

108
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,379
always equivalent of resources and so

109
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,789
forth or how long things take but we

110
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:15,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be professional we have to be</font>

111
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:18,870
businesslike but even<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all of that</font>

112
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:21,240
it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to another quality</font>

113
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:25,190
which I want to introduce and have not

114
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:29,250
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the formerly in the past</font>

115
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:31,100
one of the opportunities<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

116
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,040
advantages that we have

117
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,950
of in the way I can is structured as not

118
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,130
being a government Bureau even though we

119
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:44,870
sometimes try very hard to look like we

120
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:48,740
are is the opportunity to do things in a

121
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:51,410
in a better way better can mean smarter

122
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:56,080
but it can also mean warmer more

123
00:06:51,410 --> 00:07:00,020
engaging more accessible and I've been

124
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:03,250
paying attention you mean I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

125
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:05,000
paying attention to a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of specific</font>

126
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,690
interactions that I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> the privilege</font>

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,240
to watch from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inside and and asking</font>

128
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:14,000
hard questions did we do this in a way

129
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,850
that leaves all of the people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,370
interacting with a feeling good<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

131
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:23,180
the interaction even if we have to say

132
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:27,320
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a negative message are</font>

133
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:30,170
we operating in a fashion that causes

134
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,060
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say yeah that's really I'm</font>

135
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:35,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">glad to have had this interaction I'm</font>

136
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,670
glad to and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization works the</font>

137
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:40,130
way I'd like it to work as I say even

138
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:44,780
even in cases where the outcome might

139
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:48,830
not be objectively where this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is</font>

140
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:51,380
the human element here and I know that

141
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:54,140
sounds odd coming from somebody who is a

142
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,020
techie or maybe as some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my friends or</font>

143
00:07:54,140 --> 00:08:01,240
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say who used to be a techie</font>

144
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:04,640
until I was moved into this position so

145
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,580
the slogan that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share with</font>

146
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:11,539
you this morning so I called the third e

147
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:14,630
for empathy and so my my stump speech

148
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:17,120
now is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be efficient we</font>

149
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:20,540
need to be effective and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

150
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,370
empathy and that needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be marbled and</font>

151
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,430
imbued all the way through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

152
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:29,240
organization in every element that we

153
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:32,680
deal with and so that's and as I say

154
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,450
it's it's coming to Africa where

155
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:38,228
feelings are evident everywhere the

156
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:42,020
warmth and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> engagement is just</font>

157
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:44,480
something that you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> even before you</font>

158
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,130
you get off the<font color="#CCCCCC"> plane effect</font>

159
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,540
flying south African Airways you feel

160
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,010
when you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the plane which I can</font>

161
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,719
tell you is different when you get on an

162
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:57,139
american airline and and so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

163
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:00,970
extent that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the extent</font>

164
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:05,930
that my colleagues and i can can know

165
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:07,790
how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> plays we will be moving as as</font>

166
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:12,349
much as possible in that general

167
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:15,199
direction and one can go overboard on

168
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:18,529
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but let me invite people</font>

169
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:22,339
who see ways in which we can be more

170
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:26,029
empathetic to speak up and speaking

171
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:28,389
again personally my door<font color="#CCCCCC"> is open on that</font>
