on society throughout the whole content

147
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,809
so that's in in kind of broad terms

148
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:16,809
thank you very much it is indeed true

149

that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet has arrived by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">only arrived in my opinion we only have</font>

151
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:26,619
the connectivity part meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

152
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:29,800
cables on our course we<font color="#CCCCCC"> still have what</font>

153
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:32,740
to do in spreading low latency hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bonnie</font>

154
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:36,279
connectivity inland we still have a

155
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,959
challenge to create a human capacity

156
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,419
that is required<font color="#CCCCCC"> to support these</font>

157
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:43,569
networks and remember these networks

158
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:45,540
arguing also very fast and so you need

159
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:49,029
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be producing the skill sets required</font>

160
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:52,390
equal it quickly and we have challenge

161
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:54,700
of how to scale that at the same time we

162
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:58,060
sometimes have porn or challenges

163
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,700
regarding the policy environment many

164
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,910
other countries do need to indeed adopt

165
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:06,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet as a separate thing not</font>

166
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:09,010
necessarily pure telecommunications per

167
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:12,099
se we need to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet as</font>

168
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:14,589
internet and begin to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it in its</font>

169
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,940
rightful place<font color="#CCCCCC"> in policy regulation</font>

170
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:21,250

171
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,920
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to adopt the internet properly</font>

172
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,560
within the society as a whole and begin

173
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,680
to depend on it as a safe place to do

174
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,050
various things you want to do from doing

175
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,969
the banking things ecommerce things all

176
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:37,779
the way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> through education to</font>

177
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:40,329
entertainment and so on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got it</font>

178
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:43,750
but we're now should be challenged<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

179
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:46,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">build the industries around it that will</font>

180
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:50,770
allow us to in some sense get a benefits

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an improved economy you know using</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a question from Remy</font>

183
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:01,959
about well<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that African all</font>

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,870
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on me was because we do have</font>

185
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:06,760
this Africa strategy and also wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

186
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:11,770
know what could be my dreams you know

187
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:15,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">for Africa well yes this can be said as</font>

188
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:17,350
a kind of a new season for Africa see

189
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,089
your father says the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new season that I</font>

190
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,820
can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always say that this new</font>

191
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:23,620
season transpired in Africa<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a tool</font>

192
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,500
a true that we do have now which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

193
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:29,019
strategy at least land up what we should

194
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:33,220
be doing and this is coming from now i

195
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:34,779
will say requests or<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually that</font>

196
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,620
people really need the things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

197
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:38,230
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that</font>

198
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,960
what we need so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can is just here to</font>

199
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,430
assist<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some point and as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Canada's</font>

200
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,950
going to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one to do it with</font>

201
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:47,349
since you insist on partnership alone on

202
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:52,330
this thing but I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to say that</font>

203
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:56,140
I just will not depend on me<font color="#E5E5E5"> only I'm</font>

204
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:59,140
seeing this as to where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

205
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:01,660
Africa she also be forging some sort of

206
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,029
new partnership in Africa to really move

207
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,699
this thing forward because ultimately

208
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:09,790
this strategy is all about capacity

209
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:12,820
development and basically also is about

210
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:15,550
you know making Africa you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font>

211
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,230
market this thing fatty said it no

212
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,209
economic growth we are seeing this at

213
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,279
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> point into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Africa's but we need to</font>

214
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,589
deepen this thing and when we come to

215
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,120
digital economy some of our country are

216
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:26,800
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really taking you know the</font>

217
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,990
appropriate measures to make this really

218
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,329
happen meaning they are not investing

219
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,550
that much on the people you see the

220
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:36,400
younger generation they rely<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font>

221
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:40,359
present who create some jobs what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,980
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few I hubs</font>

00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know here and there in Africa we</font>

224
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,970
need more on that what are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing in</font>

225
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,469
terms of you know incubators you know to

226
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,680
really help you know those younger

227
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,420
generation do those things I really

228
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,900
believe that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deepen the</font>

00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:59,170
partnership with no difference you know

232
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:05,800
Africa need to be convinced that some of

233
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:09,790
those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know just happen or</font>

234
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,290
come from<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside of Africa how are we</font>

235
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,240
really using the private sector in

236
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:16,270
Africa to do a few things for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance</font>

did we are having so many cable now you

239
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,450
know surrendering Africa so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

240
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,150
going to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue the issue is going</font>

00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,829
what are the applications it's happening

243
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,750
the few places in Africa we would like

244
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be seen this happen in most places</font>

245
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:37,420
where we are using those<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool to really</font>

246
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:40,029
solve local problems and we definitely

247
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:43,000
understand that those who<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do it is</font>

just support<font color="#E5E5E5"> Afrikaans and I think</font>

250
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,730
that's what I can

251
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,520
we've got Kevin Murphy from domain

252
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,860
insight com in London on the phone with

253
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:58,060
a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> keV yeah so this morning I</font>

254
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:04,120
can sign the legacy contract yeah with

255
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:06,520
the Chinese version<font color="#CCCCCC"> or cocaine now that</font>

256
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,650
isn't subject adapted bikes but in the

257
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,970
English language versions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pain and</font>

gaming are subjected appadvice and

259
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:20,080
therefore tell me on hold and the pound

260
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:21,760
sign contract with i can get and it

261
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,760
struck me that might be a fairness

262
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,319
problem here because the back said in

263
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">beijing and they said again at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

264
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:33,870
weekend that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> streams that</font>

265
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,880
they're concerned about is non

266
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:39,880
exhaustive and they told me yesterday

267
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,620
about adding more things to it and it

268
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,960
doesn't seem obviously what happens if

269
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,540
you sign a contract<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the registry</font>

270
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:51,610
and then the gap subsequently adds them

271
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:53,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">TV need a list of worrying kill these so</font>

272
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,660
i guess my question it wouldn't be fair

273
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:59,320
to either freeze all the applications or

274
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:02,020
none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in order to live a blanket</font>

275
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,980
oh and also if you could address what

276
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:08,110
the actual process is<font color="#E5E5E5"> or if the gap</font>

277
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:12,160
suddenly says oh gee forgot to add

278
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:15,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">chinese game to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be and talk that one</font>

279
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">less one got it now thanks</font>

280
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:28,190
well thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you Kevin for the question</font>

281
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:31,459
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry because the quality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

282
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:34,670
audio was just enough so I can get good

283
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:37,310
good part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it but not all of it but I</font>

284
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:42,589
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're asking is specifically</font>

285
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:44,599
how would we deal with advice that the

286
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">GAC our governmental advisory committee</font>

287
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:52,070
would provide possibly after maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

288
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:54,530
signed contracts with with registries so

289
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,500
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I can say about this as I'm</font>

290
00:14:54,530 --> 00:15:00,589
sure you know Kevin is I cannot clearly

291
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:04,120
speculate on what advice and if we will

292
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:06,860
get any advice and when we do get advice

293
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:10,190
we will address it I think we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

294
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:13,580
mechanisms right now in the new registry

295
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:15,320
contract and some of the the legal

296
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,290
frameworks we built around that that

297
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:23,230
allow us to deal with eventualities of

298
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:26,540
change but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I cannot right now</font>

299
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:28,520
speculate on what staff or board might

300
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,339
decide depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on advice we haven't</font>

301
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:35,420
received<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet but as you know and well</font>

302
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:37,580
anyway sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just all open that sorry</font>

303
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,160
I'm talking about advice you already

304
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,740
have received and the Beijing communique

305
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,990
not a list instead of non exhaustive the

306
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:48,920
treaty it seems by now like it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

307
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:53,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">exhausted so I'm wondering why the</font>

308
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:56,900
discrepancy yeah again I the advice that

309
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:59,000
was received was addressed in our

310
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,650
responses public responses to that I

311
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,130
don't think I want to comment any

312
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:09,290
further on this today we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are continuing</font>

313
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:12,650
work with the GAC on some of the parts

314
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:16,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">of their advice as we speak so some of</font>

315
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:21,560
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still in motion but as I said</font>

316
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:23,660
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we met last time in Beijing I can</font>

317
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,589
is going to have to move forward with

318
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:32,300
this program carefully thoughtfully but

319
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:34,370
also in an agile way which means we

320
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,040
might take some advice

321
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,410
address it move forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some parts</font>

322
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,829
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> program and adjust as we go</font>

323
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:46,069
forward this way we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are functioning as</font>

324
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:49,730
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> community expects us to with care</font>

325
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:52,100
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> also with agility and speed always</font>

326
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,500
measured by the needs of listening to

327
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the community</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and ensuring the security</font>

are not going to compromise<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Rebecca</font>

330
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:06,619
from IDG my question is regarding the

331
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,660
infrastructure the l root program that

332
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:11,270
you have with the phrenic<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wonder how</font>

333
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:14,390
far it has gone in terms of spreading

334
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:16,699
across their different countries and the

335
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:19,189
multi-stakeholder model that you keep

336
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:22,040
talking about keep spreading the world

337
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:25,449
the word about it seems to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be</font>

and work together to discover the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

later telecommunications it was

<font color="#CCCCCC">absolutely the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right model to do that</font>

363
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:44,330
the secretary today spoke eloquently

00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:45,460
about the need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to increase</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access in</font>

365
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,580
Africa and

366
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,130
is clearly an area he put a lot of focus

367
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:54,250
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of work on and continues to</font>

and we support<font color="#CCCCCC"> him and deeply respect</font>

369
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:59,919
the work of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITU in that area having</font>

370
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:03,100
said that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet is a different</font>

371
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,409
resource no one country no one

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,830
organization no matter how powerful it

373
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:11,529
is could actually manage and run the

374
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:15,220
Internet including I can by the way so

375
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:17,770
no one it it is a resource<font color="#E5E5E5"> that requires</font>

376
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:20,799
a multi-stakeholder approach now whether

377
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:23,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyone got that yet that's a different</font>

378
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">story but they will because those who</font>

379
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:29,500
get into managing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet very</font>

380
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:32,860
quickly realize that unless we all come

00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,960
together businesses academics technical

382
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:38,168
people governments international

383
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,149
organizations we are not able to manage

384
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:44,669
this great resource I'll give you one

385
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:49,600
small example today you saw an African

386
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:52,179
registrar a<font color="#E5E5E5"> French registrar a Canadian</font>

387
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,799
registrar and American registrar all

388
00:19:52,179 --> 00:20:00,880
stand up and sign one<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreement the same</font>

389
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:03,100
exact agreement hundreds over a thousand

390
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,590
registrar's in the world will now be

391
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,139
accredited and government by one

392
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:10,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">agreement that ensures that the</font>

393
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:13,450
registrant and user rights are

394
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:16,539
maintained what government can do that

395
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:20,380
what international<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization can do</font>

396
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:23,379
that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> only able to do that because</font>

397
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:26,049
multiple stakeholders including the

398
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,840
contracted parties work together for

399
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:32,110
years and came up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the formula that</font>

400
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:35,860
enabled us in one negotiation to have

401
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:39,189
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreement for all these registrar's</font>

402
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:42,039
across tens of countries to sign a legal

403
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:44,049
binding agreement that ensures the

404
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:48,010
public interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the registrant and</font>

405
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:50,379
the users are assisted so to close on

00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,299
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I think that quite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

407
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,419
opposite we're seeing actually many

408
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:56,710
governments move towards a

409
00:20:54,419 --> 00:21:00,340
multi-stakeholder model

<font color="#E5E5E5">that very soon here in Africa will see</font>

actually the tide towards

multi-stakeholder governance at a

<font color="#E5E5E5">into our transnational multi-stakeholder</font>

00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:23,440
policies will also be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in place and it is</font>

418
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,480
growing we have a lot of information

<font color="#CCCCCC">that shows that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> governments are moving</font>

00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:32,860
more in that direction than the other

in Africa because of today we can count

eight countries that are actually

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:49,480
hosting those n roots and we have

honeymoon on that and dishing decision

430
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:01,539
has been taken actually too heavily

00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:05,890
involve you know the regional managers

00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:16,390
inform you know countries on those

436
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:20,139
procedures and also have them come up

437
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:22,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">with their own desire to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually host</font>

438
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,580
know those<font color="#E5E5E5"> roots but is happening at</font>

439
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:27,460
least<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one that icon is in charge of</font>

440
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:30,549
I mean we have very good this ignition

441
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,380
so far in Africa so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

442
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:36,399
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just depends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on country</font>

443
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:38,289
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> could come forward and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then by by</font>

444
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:40,479
the some of the procedures and have the

445
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:44,500
appropriate you know equipment in place

446
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:49,240
and the rest is will be easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> done by I</font>

447
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,830
can end a fennec in collaboration<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font>

448
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">you we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got one question that just</font>

449
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,770
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and this is a two-parter fari to</font>

450
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,570
you first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all can you talk about</font>

451
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:01,059
specifically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICANN strategy panel</font>

452
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:04,299
that you appointed dr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> clinger to chair</font>

453
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:06,510
and secondly dr. cleaner would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talk</font>

454
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:09,590
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you envisioned for that panel</font>

455
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:16,129
and this I'm delighted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

456
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:18,860
because for a long time especially the

457
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:23,090
last few<font color="#CCCCCC"> months as we saw the role of I</font>

458
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:26,299
can become clearer in different parts of

459
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:29,320
the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> it became evident that we need</font>

460
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:33,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a conversation as a community on</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public responsibility framework of</font>

462
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:44,178

463
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:47,330
are we going to do to support and grow

464
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:49,010
and extend our capabilities to enable

465
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,620
our stakeholders around the world to

466
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:54,379
achieve their goals we said we need the

467
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:56,809
framework we need clarity on what is it

468
00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:00,950
we need to be doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

469
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:03,049
be doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I went around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

470
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:06,409
community and I asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I'm ready to</font>

471
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:09,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">form a strategy panel to discuss that</font>

472
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:12,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">who should lead it who should share it</font>

473
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,960
and the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> name frankly that kept</font>

474
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:18,199
coming back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me from different parts</font>

475
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,500
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world was your own Nick wey nose</font>

476
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,659
name and when I reached him if not too

477
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:27,110
long ago just a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks ago to</font>

478
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:30,409
ask if he would<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree to come help us do</font>

479
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:34,639
that I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> delighted by his willingness</font>

480
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:37,130
I was delighted<font color="#CCCCCC"> by his deep</font>

481
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,190
understanding of how important this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

482
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,600
not just for africa for the world so

483
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:44,390
what is important<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us here to</font>

484
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,870
understand is that Nick Wayne are in

485
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:52,580
doing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> hole is actually going to</font>

486
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:56,029
take his great<font color="#CCCCCC"> African spirit and use it</font>

487
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:58,460
to think about how the whole world needs

488
00:24:56,029 --> 00:25:01,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fit into a public responsibility</font>

489
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:04,399
framework in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICANN agenda and he</font>

490
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:06,260
will I'm sure gather a great team a

491
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:07,939
diverse<font color="#CCCCCC"> team of people from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around the</font>

492
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">world and he will take the leadership</font>

493
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:13,279
which as you know him<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am certain he</font>

494
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:16,549
will so we welcome him in this hole and

495
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:19,620
we welcome I can having<font color="#E5E5E5"> that discussion</font>

496
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:23,480
as a community on our public

497
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:28,050
responsibility is moving forward me

498
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:31,440
actually maybe the best responses give

499
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:35,550
me some time to understand what a

500
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:38,100
community's expecting and so maybe the

501
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:41,220
next icon meeting if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you ask me I'll be</font>

502
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:45,659
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be much more intelligent about a</font>

503
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:48,000
response but what I can say is that I

504
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:50,850
feel honored by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> confidence that</font>

505
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,240
community has in me and in particular

506
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:58,199
the support from fatty and steaming and

507
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,870
peer for me to undertake this effort and

508
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,960
i look forward to apply myself

509
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:07,639
appropriately in address that issue with

510
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:12,450
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> panel and the community let me again</font>

511
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:16,940
when I doc tony was responded to my

512
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:16,940
earlier question he made mention of

513
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:25,190
separating internet from other part of

514
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:28,020
ICT if I got the resin and in doing that

515
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:30,270
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure whether you also realize</font>

516
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:33,900
that in back of developing countries

517
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:35,870
including Africa that most isp's

518
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,760
actually going on the ground and the

519
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:42,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">telcos are more less springing up to</font>

520
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:47,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">offered some service that I species</font>

521
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:51,600
cannot withhold down now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have</font>

522
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:54,750
made a can of suggestion which part can

523
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,730
we take to reclaim that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

524
00:26:54,750 --> 00:27:00,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of model that was a sitting</font>

525
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:03,090
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the telcos came in and then to</font>

526
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:05,280
cover the market if you take Nigeria for

527
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,199
instance I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scene a lot of</font>

528
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,360
experience this thing where when they

529
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">came into the scene it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a different</font>

530
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">ballgame yes please cannot sell their</font>

531
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:16,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">products now the telcos are not selling</font>

532
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,199
the same product with their voice

533
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:23,040
products and if you are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reclaim</font>

534
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:26,880
it are we going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> engage the government</font>

535
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:31,550
so intensely to ensure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

536
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,309
enough incentive that are implementable

537
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:35,559
thank you

538
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:39,700
if the telcos are providing internet

539
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:42,730
service there is peace the only thing

540
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,889
one is thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about here is that let's</font>

541
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,320
not apply the telecommunication

542
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:49,840
regression approaches to how the

543
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,418
internet things are working if the Alba

544
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,539
can't evolve become ISPs then we should

545
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:57,669
manage them as is<font color="#E5E5E5"> peace if they are</font>

546
00:27:55,539 --> 00:28:00,340
providing our content services then we

547
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:02,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">should think of them as such so it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

548
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:06,009
really to say they shouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in isp</font>

549
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:08,139
business but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other things I</font>

550
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:10,929
mean we have registrar's we have

551
00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:13,389
registries we have content no developers

552
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:15,220
we have no provisioning content or

553
00:28:13,389 --> 00:28:18,129
content provisional companies we are

554
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:22,659
ecommerce companies and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm asking where</font>

555
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:26,439
is Africa what policy will spare

556
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:28,690
movement into e-commerce or into heavy

557
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,749
development of content or delivery of

558
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:35,830
content or encourage registrar's to

559
00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:37,840
emerge even in the local ccTLD I mean

560
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:40,689
there must be a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of policy</font>

561
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,639
that will encourage those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font>

562
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:46,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">asking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a country</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should take a good</font>

563
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:49,990
look and in the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing freely are</font>

564
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:52,119
supposed to apply some other method of

565
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:54,309
regulation to this new thing that's

566
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:56,918
really you know have new prescription

567
00:28:54,309 --> 00:29:02,289
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it would not wake the whole</font>

way yeah I'm sorry farty did you want to

joining them to build new ideas is not

happening they will give you a lot of

conditions while you cannot or why you

00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,470
must have a platform before you can join

599
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:28,750
them so is making it more difficult for

people especially in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our own environment</font>

an<font color="#E5E5E5"> excellent question and one that has</font>

610
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:09,730
organization as it grows naturally

611
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:12,370

617
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:32,320
now we realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last six</font>

problem you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> let that simply brings</font>

623

more people to be more frustrated

624
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:53,530
therefore in parallel with that and

625
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:55,890
these are things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not seen</font>

00:31:53,530 --> 00:32:00,899
yet because they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been in development</font>

627
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:04,210
we have started<font color="#E5E5E5"> a major effort to also</font>

make it easier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to engage into</font>

00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:12,730
the I can fear these will include

630
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:14,890
education we will be announcing<font color="#CCCCCC"> assume</font>

631

some initiatives in that area<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">think we you will be very pleased with</font>

make contributions into I can second we

636
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,610
have started showing new technologies

mean by oasis this is an open welcoming

foundational to our legitimacy if people

00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:47,470
through digital engagement but we are

00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:58,620
relationships are continuous and

725
00:36:54,410 --> 00:37:00,390
long-lasting and that very often will

726
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,890
involve people who will be in one

position one day in a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> position</font>

the interaction might be that we have to

735
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:31,799
say no to something it's you've done in

736

a way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a positive end engaging</font>

you know when they call up and yell at

758
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:43,430
be more satisfying than if we just think

759
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:46,549
that we're doing a civil service job

760
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:48,049
from nine to five body<font color="#E5E5E5"> I received a</font>

reporters that I had contact with after

763
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:54,530
your welcoming ceremony today we made a

00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,779
big deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Raa in the registry</font>

00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,290
there are a lot of reporters that are

covering us they dip into our<font color="#E5E5E5"> world they</font>

769
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:06,680
you kind of explain in very lace<font color="#CCCCCC"> peak</font>

770
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:09,050
why those two agreements are so

771
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:18,230
important and why they move us closer to

772

are the entities that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are being licensed</font>

00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:36,490
by I can in order to operate their top

<font color="#E5E5E5">the relationship again to be quite</font>

00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:56,470
signatories today here it's a historical

moment for us for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry in durban</font>

00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:59,029
today so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very obviously very very</font>

pleased with

development sir hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> David from HT XD</font>

844
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:08,750
Africa as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell our website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

845
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:12,380
kind of primed for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new gTLDs tool</font>

846
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:15,020
and basically what I'd like to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

847
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:16,850
there's there's very limited resources

848
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:19,120
specifically in South Africa when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

849
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:21,500
look at something like electricity and

850
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:23,270
what's happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> now is we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smart</font>

851
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,950
grids and smart cities in the Internet

852
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:26,450
of Things starting to roll out to Africa

853
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:29,180
where we need to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how to take our</font>

854
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:33,200
limited resources and apply them better

855
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:35,060
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what we have at the moment can</font>

856
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,140
be used for our growing population as

857
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:39,920
you said were the fastest-growing

858
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:43,089
continent on in in the world so with

859
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,350
that in mind how is I can dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

860
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:47,690
governments and municipalities and

861
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:50,660
things like that in terms of something

862
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:52,460
like an ipv6 rollout we're ensuring that

863
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,540
the entire continent is ready for

864
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:56,720
something like the Internet of Things

865
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:59,660
and a smart grid and what have you and

866
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,910
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I can labs being a</font>

867
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:04,759
part of that in terms of helping to roll

868
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:07,819
out technology where certain countries

869
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,410
may not be aware of the ability to take

870
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,110
what they have and make it better and

871
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:15,200
focus it I will tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the small bit I</font>

872
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:17,960
do on this the small bit i do on this is

873
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,990
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need American or European or</font>

874
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:23,000
companies in the developed world I tell

875
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:26,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">them that a lot of innovation is</font>

876
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,920
happening in Africa I don't tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

877
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:33,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Africa because Africa needs</font>

878
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,570
frankly their training or their help we

879
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:38,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about the great things happening in</font>

880
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:41,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">Africa now Africa leads the world in</font>

881
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:44,000
mobile innovation right now and we need

882
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">to keep telling people who are looking</font>

883
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,230
for business opportunities and looking

884
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:51,980
for growth that Africa is a place<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

885
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:54,940
they can come and actually grow their

886
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:57,890
portfolios and their activities so

887
00:44:54,940 --> 00:45:00,290
Africa is ready and primed for that

888
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:02,180
level of innovation and I think the

889
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:04,910
world should come and learn from Africa

890
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:07,160
and participate in Africa's innovation

891
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:10,339
drive right now but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

892
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,629
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're doing to work</font>

893
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:14,090
with the government and other

894
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:15,710
to enable the infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font>

895
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:18,200
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> things like the internet of things</font>

896
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:22,460
happen I will look to my friend Pierre

897
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:24,680
to for some guidance and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense I thank</font>

898
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:27,740
you very much for this question which

899
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:31,730
also called for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> motive might call</font>

900
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:34,939
the need for Africa to really own this

901
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:37,760
technology you mentioned issues such as

902
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:39,230
the resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> he has power reducing same</font>

903
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,330
a lot this goes clearly together

904
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:44,060
actually if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have a robust</font>

905
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:48,500
with no ICT industry definitely you need

906
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:52,700
to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about those and energy I was</font>

907
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:55,610
discussing with that I'll am the

00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:12,680
important but you are right to know what

916
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:20,180
when it comes with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing because</font>

917
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:21,859
it's all about government know having

00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:24,410
the right strategy and it put a red

919
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:28,070
strategy<font color="#CCCCCC"> now in place if they want to</font>

922
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:36,980
for instance now is to reach out to

923
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:39,439
government for instance but in our own

00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:53,660
we have close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 countries today</font>

where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are experiencing this thing</font>

931
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:58,370
where government suddenly say well I

932
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:01,549
want to manage this thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we</font>

933
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:05,359
have to educate to tell people that ok

934
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:08,150
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are procedures and also you might</font>

935
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:10,370
own life in that you own your ccTLD but

936
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:12,530
you like a sewage on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mean a has to</font>

international laws you know regulation

940
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:21,860
for instance so we have to educate at

941
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:23,339
some point we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to expose them</font>

942
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:30,150
to best practices for

that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> God I can also and they're on</font>

944
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:34,860
Wednesday for instance we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a panel</font>

951
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:54,480
going to showcase what they've been

952
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:57,779
doing and one of them told me for

953
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,520
anything that well if our government

954
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:02,160
could really understand what you are

955
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,680
doing if I government pico de sa where

956
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,200
we are young we really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

957
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:09,540
something much more interested no we

958
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,629
don't have jobs so both government are

959
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:14,370
still working on the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> model for</font>

960
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:17,490
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> or they are really in need of</font>

961
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:20,310
new models also some other thing we do

962
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:21,750
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay outreach to the countries and</font>

963
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:24,120
then some other thing I'm going to do

964
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:26,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">within the Africa SATA G is definitely</font>

965
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:28,350
that one how we doing casual government

966
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:30,390
know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about digital economy</font>

967
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:32,549
that's what we want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

968
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:35,160
they really see that is there potential

969
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:37,470
day and that call for<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay building your</font>

970
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:41,430
own strategy folk / bond but of course

971
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:44,160
also for energy I think the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> news is</font>

972
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:46,680
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Inga form I mean that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

973
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">Africa from monty hace is going to be</font>

974
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:51,779
revamped and then also built and

975
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:53,970
frequently welcome banker<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those are</font>

976
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:56,190
quite interested in that I mean energy

977
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:58,319
because the belief is that this in guys

978
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:01,830
going to at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> so of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> African problem</font>

979
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:04,320
and the acids his own could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be covered</font>

980
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:07,290
in half of Africa in terms of image to

981
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:09,180
this potential here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem that Africa</font>

982
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:11,779
you know has now understood this thing

983
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:15,210
and there's going to be some sort of

984
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:17,520
marshall plan on this thing so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

985
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:20,370
promising but you are right<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font>

986
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,340
issues actually my name is Alfred in

security of the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so on I'm</font>

995
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:56,350
sure my good friend here will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

996
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:58,569
to say but I can tell you that on the

997
00:49:56,350 --> 00:50:00,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">continent we have a group of</font>

998
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:04,360
institutions that we call up stars

999
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:07,780
that's the african internet groups and

1000
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:09,760
one of them is focusing on creating what

1001
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:12,390
they refer to as emergency response

1002
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,880
teams we call the group<font color="#E5E5E5"> africa set and</font>

1003
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:19,390
the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to support governments and</font>

1004
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:21,610
other institutions in countries to build

1005
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:24,879
their own response teams around their

1006
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:28,210
networks so that if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bank or a</font>

1007
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,220
system of banks didn't need to have a

1008
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:32,890
way of responding when there is an

1009
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:38,430
intrusion so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help at least on</font>

1010
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:41,920
the that side of remediation now we also

1011
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:44,799
believe that capacity is a major aspect

1012
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:48,280
