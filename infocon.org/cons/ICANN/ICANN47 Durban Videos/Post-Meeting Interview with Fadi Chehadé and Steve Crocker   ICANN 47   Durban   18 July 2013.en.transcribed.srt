00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet in Africa a lot of discussion</font>

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,849
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> its positive possibilities but</font>

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,730
also a need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> build infrastructure and</font>

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:20,640
to educate in that context what are your

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,460
takeaways from this meeting well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,550
relate a story this morning a number of

us had the distinct opportunity to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,850
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Township here in Durban to paint to</font>

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:45,510
classroom of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 30 or so 14 year olds</font>

15

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:53,010
question was how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard</font>

17
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:56,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the internet only one child raised</font>

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,960
his hand I could not<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe it I</font>

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,940
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I couldn't communicate so</font>

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:06,930
I I probed further only one child said

21
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:10,369
yeah my mom uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're 14 year olds</font>

22
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:14,970
in a township in Durban eager to learn

23
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:18,420
wonderful faces great spirit but no

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:21,210
connectivity so I'm glad to say that

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,640
through the great work of<font color="#CCCCCC"> zegna our</font>

partners and our host here a commitment

27
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,590
was immediately made to the school to

the principal<font color="#CCCCCC"> the a computer lab will be</font>

29
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,600
connected to the internet and it will

30
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,908
all be paid for for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

31
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,970
frankly more of this should happen more

32
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,860
of us at ICANN meetings need to engage

33
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,229
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the local community this was a</font>

34
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,409
great first and I hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> we keep doing</font>

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">this moving forward Steve picking up on</font>

36
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,640
what font just said at the opening

37
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,700
ceremony you stressed the desire for I

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,890
can to remain empathetic even as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,469
expands globally talk to me about that

40
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,469
yeah actually let me expand in two ways

41
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:05,560
as an organization one of the

42
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:07,600
opportunities<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have because we're</font>

00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,060
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a government organization or</font>

embedded<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a beaker bureaucracy is to</font>

45
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:16,840
not only do our job well and we've I've

46
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:20,590
stressed in the past effectiveness<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

47
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,810
efficiency but I realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's it's</font>

48
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,890
possible that you can be effective<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

49
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,510
efficient and be cold and distant and

50
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,890
difficult to deal with and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

51
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:34,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we want we want exactly the</font>

52
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:36,488
opposite we want to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> positive</font>

experience in dealing with us the other

54
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,930
aspect of which I think relates very

55
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:44,709
strongly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what body has just said is</font>

56
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:47,650
that a very important part of us is that

57
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:50,920
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not a single actor we're part of</font>

58
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:55,630
an internet ecosystem we have we

59
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,760
interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with other organizations and we</font>

60
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:00,400
cannot be<font color="#CCCCCC"> successful unless the entire</font>

61
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,890
ecosystem is successful so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's exactly</font>

62
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">this kind of engagement with the</font>

63
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:10,958

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,608
<font color="#CCCCCC">Durban but in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> general with the with the</font>

67
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,340
like the supporting<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization CC NSO</font>

68
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:24,970
which is got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> special place in my heart</font>

69
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,110
or or more broadly throughout the entire

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,810
in

71
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:32,780
I mean Brad the facts are clear only one

72
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:36,130
in six people in Africa are connected to

73
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:40,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet there's a lot of work to do</font>

74
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:45,470
we I can and our community as Steve said

75
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:49,670
must increase our commitment to serving

76
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:51,500
and growing the use of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS and the</font>

77
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,929
internet and the servicing of the new

78
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,910
businesses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the new growth that is</font>

79
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,810
being seen in Africa<font color="#E5E5E5"> but on the good</font>

80

85
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:16,010
forty-eight percent in the last eight

86
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:18,320
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is the trends are all</font>

87
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:21,409
there the engines of economic growth are

88
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,540
there we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be here and supportive</font>

89
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:26,210
of the areas that have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

90
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,490
difficulties and need our help not stay

91
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,859
away from this now we must still do this

within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the remit of I can this is not</font>

00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,690
an organization that has empathy so what

98
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,789
you're saying funny is it would be

99
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,770
unfair to simply look at those low

103
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,900
now frankly leading the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> in growth</font>

106
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:11,389
unlike past spurts in African growth all

107
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:15,050
the experts agree now that Africa's

108
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:20,000
growth seems quite sustainable and quite

109
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:21,460
real and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as many factors support why the</font>

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:13,180
ceremonial signing for the registrar and

126
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,739
registry agreements tell me how

127
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:18,550
important is this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of a</font>

emotional milestone as well as a

00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:55,780
meaningful to the market and to build

141
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:58,299
industries to build communities exactly

142
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,909
the purpose why the new gTLDs were

143
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,669
introduced so indeed I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

144
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:06,539

program frankly in positive territory

146
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:12,340

we discussed and committed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to we are</font>

153
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,638
significant is that we have contractual

154
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:33,360
relationships and hence very

155
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:37,379
frequent and extensive interactions with

<font color="#CCCCCC">dimension in culture and experience and</font>

162
00:07:54,659 --> 00:08:02,219
operational capability and I I think

163
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:08,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they are the real backbone of the</font>

164
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:10,740
internet DNS infrastructure and and

165
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:14,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're they're both interdependent with</font>

166
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:18,029
each other and independent and as I say

167
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:23,129
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that they provide a great source</font>

168
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:27,509
of insight and expertise so I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

169
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:31,860
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them as strong partners as</font>

170
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:33,149
strong colleagues<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this this is</font>

171
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,070
there as you said their<font color="#CCCCCC"> tenth</font>

172
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:38,630

173
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:41,519
quite noteworthy and worth celebrating

174
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:45,320
they've had very good leadership and

175
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,850
this time also marks a change from

remarkable and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Samba of talent there</font>

the subsequent operating planning

191

process so the strategy planning process

192
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,470
should take us through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

inform

both of these and inform them on these

198
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,100
five areas that we felt listening to the

199
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,780
community receiving feedback from the

200
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,970
community through the website we said

201
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:58,839
that these five areas are areas that

202
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:02,680
frankly require more in-depth analysis

203
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:04,920
and more in-depth information these<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> emphasize that these five</font>

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:14,140
strategy panels are not going to in any

00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:16,450
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> shape or form circumvent any I can</font>

207
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,100
processes such as our PDP process to

208
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,980
develop policy they're not designed to

209
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,380
do that and they're not in a place to do

210
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,740
that there are simply places where

211
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:28,570
dialogue will happen in fact with input

212
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,690
from the community during this week I

213
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:35,860
have instructed my team that each of

214
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:38,590
these panels must start its mission by

215
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,510
having a town hall meeting by<font color="#E5E5E5"> listening</font>

216
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:42,070
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community and that halfway</font>

217
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,470
through their progress they must do

218
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,150
another town hall to chat and discuss

219
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,640
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community what they have</font>

220
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:50,560
learned and then towards the end before

221
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,830
they publish their recommendation again

222
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,619
another town hall so they are embedded

223
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:59,110
in the community they will be made<font color="#CCCCCC"> up of</font>

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the community and all they</font>

225
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,460
will do at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> is inform the</font>

community not me<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the board inform</font>

227
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:09,370
the community to aid us in the process

228
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:11,530
of creating for I can solid strategies

229
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,610
and solid operating plans for the year's

230
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:18,130
end we're recording this interview on

231
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:22,270
Mandela Day the 95th birthday of Nelson

232

00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:28,590
to be in this country on this continent

234
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:28,590
on this day it is said

235
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:36,509
this is extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> special for me I've</font>

236
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:38,998
followed as many of us have his life and

237
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:40,980
what he's done he's clearly an

238
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:43,740
inspiration to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world not just to</font>

239
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:48,149
South Africans he's bigger than any man

240
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:51,149
in my memory this time we live I landed

241
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:53,069
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Joburg and the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I did with</font>

244
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,779
that was burned and he suffered in it

245
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:03,180
with his family and had to build walls

246
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:08,399
within the house to dodge bullets for

247
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:11,040
his girls what is amazing about his

248
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,339
spirit as we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> him here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and people</font>

249
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,849

250
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:21,540

making our points and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop being very</font>

262
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:59,279
proactive and vigilant and ensuring that

263
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,899
the multi-stakeholder model and the

264

policies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> produces are the right</font>

265
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:07,399

purpose a spirit of working together

269
