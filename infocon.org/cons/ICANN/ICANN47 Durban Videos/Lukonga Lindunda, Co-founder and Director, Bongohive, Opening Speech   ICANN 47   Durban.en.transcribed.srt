this is a project that we worked on and

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I worked on personally to showcase</font>

what internet is doing in Africa but

00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:16,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">specifically what innovation is doing</font>

less<font color="#E5E5E5"> than five institutions or places</font>

together innovating and using our map to

what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to show Africa is</font>

bring together some proposals and hope

that Google Microsoft and all the big

59
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,390
anyway back then it was hard it was hard

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,459
to convince<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that lusaka had</font>

61

internet had computers and had people

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:18,470
who were willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use technologies so</font>

63
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:21,000
what did<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do we just started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Netherlands and what you see</font>

70
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:44,370
NGO and these young people were brought

71
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:47,450
so that they could clean and repair

72
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:50,130
these computers ready for distribution I

73
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:52,459
know most of you know the store whole

74
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,900
story of refurbished computers in Africa

75
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:59,130
well fortunately that's how we started

76
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:02,190
our hub the guy in yellow orange there

77
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,380
is messy he is a co-founder of Bongo

78
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:09,180
hive and this was our first session at

79
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:12,900
bongo hive on web technologies it lasted

80
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,750
around two hours no refreshments with

81
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:20,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet roughly I think 56 kilobits per</font>

82
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:24,659

84
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:29,759
Africa

85
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,669
still not having enough internet to

86
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,690
really innovate to really take advantage

87
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:38,250
of to create locally relevant services

88
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,110
but our story is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we did not stop</font>

89
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,349
who do not wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your fiber came</font>

90
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,270
through to our homes we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not wait</font>

91
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:52,650
till we had an agreement with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> telecom</font>

97
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:15,719
now is used for people to meet together

98
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:17,370
to create locally relevant solutions the

99
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:20,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys standing in front of a Freeport</font>

101
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:29,849
university while studying biomedical

102
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:31,740
sciences I think he's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> core that</font>

103
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:33,840
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best I've seen in the country</font>

104
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,159
he's now going back this year to

105
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,750
university to study computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> science</font>

106
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:41,490
that represents many of the stories in

107
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,409
Africa people going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to school because</font>

108
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:47,490
you know they have to fulfill their

109
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:50,610
parents wishes technology or IT is seen

110
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,919
as or that thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you do hanging</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

112
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:58,948
understanding and many parents right now

113
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:02,810
don't understand some of the professions

114
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,810
that are available already<font color="#E5E5E5"> in technology</font>

115
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:08,550
this was a session a hackathon a two-day

116
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:12,960
hackathon at bongo hive and we had a

117
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:15,389
t-score which many of you who know<font color="#CCCCCC"> pisco</font>

118
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,080
have very interesting language training

119
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,129
course sticking them years put together

120
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,520
and we could say it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> exclusive</font>

121
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:25,379
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> only people from the West or</font>

122
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:31,080
Americans have access to this language

123
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:32,940
training course so what did<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do darrow</font>

124
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,690
and his friends put together this

125
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">android app called banta barbell when</font>

126
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:41,009
you come to them than you access this

127
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:46,050
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> translate into 10 local</font>

128
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:50,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">languages we took content made it</font>

129
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:53,069
available to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> masses this is a true</font>

130
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:55,590
example of what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Osaka at</font>

131
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:59,240
bongo hive and what many other Africans

132
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:14,520
are doing creating locally relevant

133
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:16,110
solutions and using local people we

134
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,830
still do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a 20 megabit</font>

135
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:21,419
connection running into our hub but we

136
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:26,219
are doing what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can with what we have</font>

137
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:30,438
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that is our story doing what we can</font>

138
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:30,439
with what we have thank you
