quick points first Africa I don't know

66
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:38,639
if you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but we're in Africa it's</font>

67
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,690
a great continent the numbers are

68
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:45,599
amazing this is now the fastest growing

69
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:48,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">continent on the planet by GDP it is</font>

70
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,760
also a young continent it's a billion

71
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:53,129
people today in another generation it'll

72
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,220
be 2 billion people it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing faster</font>

73
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:58,918
than Asia even it is a continent where

74
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,069
the growth in income is remarkable

75
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:04,799
thirty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> growth in real income</font>

76
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:08,298
over the last decade the decade before

77
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,760
that income had shrunk ten percent

78
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:15,799
secondary school<font color="#E5E5E5"> enrollment up by fifty</font>

79
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,880
percent in the last few years these are

80
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:21,500
fundamentally different numbers about

81
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,180
Africa everything artists designers

82
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,330
innovators are thriving<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the hope of</font>

83
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,159
Africa and it is showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is shown I</font>

84
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,590
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even know that Nigeria alone</font>

85
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:34,349
produces more movies than all of the

86
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:37,080
American studios there is a lot going on

87
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:38,110
in Africa right now you just need to

88
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,690
watch and

89
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,450
I think most importantly as the

90
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:47,110
economist said recently the engines of

91
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:50,590
growth in Africa are humming right now

92
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:53,440
and unlike previous growth spurts in

93
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:56,260
Africa this time it seemed very

94
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,660
sustainable the amount of foreign<font color="#CCCCCC"> direct</font>

95
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,960
investment in Africa is huge right now

96
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,400
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watch so for</font>

97
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,909
those of us living in parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

98
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,669
where growth is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that forthcoming</font>

99
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:13,860
Africa is going to pull us up Africa now

100
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:16,810
is the continent we can look to to grow

101
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,990
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are the numbers there's</font>

102
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:23,170
another thing about Africa Africa has a

103
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:26,590
great spirit that does not translate the

104
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:31,150
numbers it's a hopeful spirit it's this

105
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:34,179
spirit that we see in Madiba I had the

106
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:38,320
great pleasure with my wife on Thursday

107
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:41,290
to go to Soweto to the township and we

108
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,620
spend time in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> township walking</font>

109
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:47,380
around and visiting the home of Madiba

110
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:50,170
Nelson Mandela visiting across the

111
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,780
street literally the home of Desmond

112
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:55,200
Tutu two Nobel Peace Prize winners on

113
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:58,750
one block the only place on the planet

114
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:02,260
quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> remarkable but what we saw in</font>

115
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:05,890
Soweto was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> spirit of Africa the</font>

116
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:09,659
spirit of madiba a great spirit and it's

117
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:14,200
a spirit<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we all need at this time</font>

118
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:16,600
so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask all the Africans in the</font>

119
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,789
room to stand up so we can give you a

120
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,500
hand for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> great continent you</font>

121
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,500
invited us to please stand

122
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:46,610
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you for welcoming us my</font>

123
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:53,150
second point is evident by<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you saw</font>

124
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:55,340
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last hour I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is revisiting how</font>

125
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:58,580
we engage with international

126
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,229
organizations and our fruitful

127
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,250
relationships in the last few<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

128
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:08,050
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the african union with the itu-r</font>

129
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:13,580
evidence that these relationships are

130
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:17,360
complex but vital<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we have come</font>

131
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:22,010
to a clear understanding that we cannot

132
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:25,160
erase each other I grew up in Beirut

133
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:29,270
where 17 factions spent 15 years trying

134
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:32,300
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> erase each other and after many years</font>

135
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:35,539
of pain<font color="#CCCCCC"> and loss everyone came to the</font>

136
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:38,420
conclusion we cannot erase each other we

137
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,490
work with each other and this is the

138
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:44,090
spirit of our engagement with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the eye</font>

139
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:46,690
gels we need each other in fact we share

140
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,950
common values and common

141
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:52,370
responsibilities to the public interest

142
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:55,360
and the public expects us to meet<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

143
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,710
challenges and do this well together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

144
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,980
in fact this morning I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

145
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:03,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">announce that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in an effort to work</font>

146
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:07,010
closer with all these international

147
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:10,330
organizations and NGOs I can will open

148
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:13,490
the next engagement<font color="#CCCCCC"> Center in Geneva and</font>

this is an important time for us and I

will later speak about all the new

vertically either entirely top-down few

211
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:53,380
of them truly bottom up but what I'm

212
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:57,130
discovering is that at I can it's

213

neither we're actually a much more

horizontal model than people think it's

215
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:07,870
all about building lateral relationships

216
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:11,620
with changing interests and figuring out

<font color="#CCCCCC">how to keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that balance and that takes</font>

much more talent and much more

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:22,510
generosity of spirit this horizontal

220

lateral model is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the true transnational</font>

221
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:28,450
model that will work<font color="#E5E5E5"> top-down will not</font>

222
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:32,560
work this is what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to maintain</font>

and to make that model work we each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

224
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,630
us every stakeholder in this room must

learn to be conciliatory and

230
00:12:52,829 --> 00:13:00,209
conciliatory is the spirit of Africa in

231
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:04,630
fact Madiba the name of Nelson Mandela

232
