6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,600
quietly worked to make this program what

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,090
it is and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> speak about</font>

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">months and we look forward to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

successes and more signatories and the

13
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,629
new gTLDs in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route later this year</font>

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:01:01,980

17
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:04,290
the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be helpful although</font>

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:13,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">we don't need them really but it would</font>

00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:23,270
think we ran a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over time so</font>

22
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:25,280
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quickly ask my Duncan or</font>

someone to give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a time check how many</font>

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:34,189
minutes do we have pardon the time I

25
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,259
need no no no we'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep this</font>

26
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:37,579
down to half an hour this<font color="#CCCCCC"> time because I</font>

27
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:40,579
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're a little bit over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time we're</font>

28
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:43,068
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> on half now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now typically as</font>

29
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:46,219
you know we translate these meetings

30
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:49,369
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the UN languages plus</font>

31
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:52,488
Portuguese today we're adding one more

32
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:54,469
language and for those of you who kind

33
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:58,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">of lived during the days when everybody</font>

34
00:01:54,469 --> 00:02:01,250
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to create a lingua franca and</font>

35
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,679
didn't quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> succeed that we believe</font>

36
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,920
that the real lingua franca is the digit

37
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:09,109
is a visual language so today we're

38
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,780
adding something new we have Rob there

39
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:15,560
to the left rob is from South Africa and

40

Europe thank you rob<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an illustrator</font>

42
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:25,160
and he will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take my presentation now and</font>

43
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:27,440
actually translate it into a picture

44
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we can share also with people on</font>

45
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,549
the web so that's that's what he does

46
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,799
for for living<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it's a new language</font>

47
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:40,400
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope will be helpful and break</font>

48
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:45,109
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the language barriers as you</font>

49
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,959
know when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were in Beijing I said that</font>

50
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:50,840
we're still in our first phase of the

51
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,630
new season and the first phase is the

52
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,319
phase of preparing the ground so that we

53
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:59,810
can build and continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow this</font>

54
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,149
organization where it needs to go we're

55
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:05,180
still in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that first phase and we will be</font>

56
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,519
there through my first<font color="#E5E5E5"> year at ICANN</font>

57
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:11,120
which should be around the Buenos Aires

58
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,900
meeting I'm happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you today that</font>

59
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,329
we are on track in fact we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

60
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,299
bit ahead of schedule on most of the

61
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:22,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">things we committed to do what I'm going</font>

62
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:24,139
to do is take you through three sections

63
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:25,459
here the first one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just quickly</font>

64
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:26,350
give you a sense of what we've

65
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,260
accomplished

66
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:35,079
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> Beijing I'll give you an update on</font>

67
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:37,390
that so from Beijing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Durban of course</font>

68
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,610
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very short hop some of you may</font>

69
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,279
remember Beijing was kind of yesterday

70
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> less than three months ago so a</font>

71
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,070
very short trimester for us but

72
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:50,860
nonetheless a busy trimester as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

73
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:54,130
saw we completed the new registry and

74
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:56,020
registrar agreements this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge</font>

75
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,660
accomplishment for you for this

76
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,180
community it moves us forward into a

77
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,400
contracting stage and it changes

78
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,460
completely where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are with this</font>

79
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:11,710
program<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think most of us can say today</font>

80
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:14,980
we can see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last mile before the</font>

81
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:17,530
first new TLD is in the route we can see

82
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,170
it it's in front of us now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

83
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:23,530
are measuring things as I said before

84
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:26,770
now by days not by weeks or months or

85
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:29,979
years we are at the point where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

86
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:33,760
seeing the light at the end of that long

87
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,770
tunnel once<font color="#E5E5E5"> again the work that went</font>

88
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,099
into getting these agreements done and

89
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:42,580
the commitment that we may to make them

90
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">work for everyone was tremendous and was</font>

91
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,409
a sign of how this community works

92
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,720
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> I must tell you there were some</font>

93
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,390
tough times and there were some big

94
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,970
debates and as you remember all of you

95
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,680
told me in Beijing do not move forward

96
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,740
with disagreements before we get another

97
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,110
chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to comment on them and I</font>

98
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,200
understood the<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do that so we did</font>

99
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:07,720
not move forward we extended the comment

100
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,539
period and allowed all of us to

101
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,000
participate give input and that input by

102
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,520
the way I must tell you was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,970
very helpful it refined the agreements

104
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,120
it made them better and so we now have

105
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:27,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">these agreements and we can move forward</font>

106
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:29,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the next stage jean-francois barrel</font>

107
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,230
who's with us here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> room along</font>

108
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,860
with Steve Crocker and many of you here

109
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:39,250
have worked together to create the next

110
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,280
generation directory service model you

111
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,120
all saw there

112
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,770
port I think I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to first commend</font>

113
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,370
them and thank them for the great work

114
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:52,520
they did this was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

115
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,560
not easy to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the details</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

116
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,919
rather to stay at the right level and

117
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,450
deliver a balanced clear report that

118
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:06,469
identified how we can move<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward past</font>

119
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:09,260
the difficulties and concerns with the

120
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:12,410
who is into a new directory service

121
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:15,349
model now what they did is not a

122
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,540
decision what they did is merely a

123
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:21,140
recommendation for this community to

124
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,600
take to debate to discuss and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

125
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:27,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">forward to the next stage so each one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

126
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:30,860
us is responsible for this and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

290
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,920
during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months we</font>

291
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,560
participated as dr. Torres said at the

292
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">wtp f in Geneva</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was an extremely</font>

293
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:21,160
important moment for us because after

294
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:23,410
the wicked we were measuring how we will

295
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,959
participate and how we will change our

296
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:29,620
posture and as you know i had the

297
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:33,128
pleasure of opening the WTF along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

298
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:36,610
dr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> Turay and during that opening dr.</font>

299
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:39,910
Turay had an interesting gesture of

300
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:42,040
wearing a blue helmet as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> recall and</font>

301
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:44,379
telling everybody that you know where

302
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:49,410
we're at peace here we're not trying to

303
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:52,660
take over I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can or the internet symbolic</font>

304
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:55,389
we need to translate that together into

305
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:58,120
a factual relationship that makes sense

306
00:14:55,389 --> 00:15:01,209
but the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> news is we are working</font>

307
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:04,660
together and we are talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that new</font>

308
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:07,689
spirit of promoting who we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

309
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:11,620
important spirit we do not need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

310
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:14,949
continue apologizing for who we are we

311
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:23,800
need to be very proud of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've done</font>

312
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:25,769
it is a great model so let's talk a

313
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:29,529
little bit about organizing ourselves

314
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:32,529
this is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about how we really</font>

315
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:34,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">work well together inside I can inside</font>

316
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:37,689
the staff group and with the community

317
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,790
so I will tell you that during the last

318
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:42,370
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> months we did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first executive</font>

319
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,170
base camp now for those of you who<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

320
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:46,269
know the word base camp so you can

321
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,939
appreciate the background for those who

322
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:50,709
climb mountains you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that as you who</font>

323
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:52,660
are climbing a big mountain at some

324
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:56,439
point there is a base camp where people

325
00:15:52,660 --> 00:16:01,000
can take a rest enlarge their lungs and

326
00:15:56,439 --> 00:16:02,230
get ready for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next climb I think all</font>

327
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,949
of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've been climbing</font>

328
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:08,709
quite fast and it was time for base camp

329
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:11,170
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course my staff wanted to know of</font>

330
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:15,790
base camp is a day or a month or six

331
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:18,189
months base camp will last us through

332
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,219
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this year this is a time for</font>

333
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:21,290
us

334
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:25,490
not add more on our plate but rather

335
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:27,920
start executing what's on a plate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

336
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,959
we met with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole executive team we</font>

337
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,019
spent a remarkable couple of days

338
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:38,479
together we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> that time to actually</font>

339
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:42,110
strengthen our unity to increase our

340
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:45,259
knowledge of how to manage there were

341
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:48,439
trainings in budget management and

342
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:51,259
facilitation and other things so we did

343
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:54,199
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that enable us to do our job</font>

344
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:56,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">better for the growing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can team for</font>

345
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:58,758
the growing I can staff and frankly

346
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:01,759
again for the growing base of supporting

347
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:03,920
the community and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the staff has grown as</font>

348
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,760
you know when I started we were at<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

349
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,908
130 people I can staff us today close to

350
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,309
200 people and will probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow again</font>

351
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:15,319
this year in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to manage an</font>

352
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:17,839
organization with a budget as many of

353
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:20,720
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is now in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next fiscal</font>

354
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,889
year a little over 140 million dollars

355
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:28,100
we have quite a bit to put in place at

356
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:31,010
every level so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are investing in our</font>

357
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:33,289
people we are empowering our staff<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

358
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,870
serve you better and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this</font>

359
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:38,570
actively one of the major changes we did

360
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:41,840
this year at executive base camp is that

361
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:44,000
we have now empowered each executive to

362
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,649
fully owned the responsibility of their

363
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,590
budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are small but important</font>

364
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:54,080
steps and empowering our team to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

365
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,639
to do their work very very well but

366
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,408
we're giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the tools we're giving</font>

367
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:02,059
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the support we're giving them the</font>

368
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:03,860
knowledge to do this very well the

369
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:06,970
second thing we've done internally is

370
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:10,820
that we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken our operations and</font>

371
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:13,220
we've now moved forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> to split them</font>

372
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:16,580
into three we have three areas of

373
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:18,980
operations operations related to working

374
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,158
with our contracted parties the

375
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,780
registries and the registrar's

376
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:26,809
administrative operations HR finance

377
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:29,450
facilities risk management<font color="#CCCCCC"> procurement</font>

378
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:31,740
etc these are very important

379
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:34,260
administrative operations

380
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,020
and thirdly we have the technical and

381
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,330
security operations to manage our DNS

382
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,540
operations our<font color="#E5E5E5"> l root which by the way</font>

383
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:45,480
is now by far the most present and

384
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:48,629
distributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> root on the planet the one</font>

385
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,429
managed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can and that requires a lot</font>

386
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,830
of operational capabilities behind it

387
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:56,190
all of our IT are growing IT

388
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:58,800
capabilities etc all of that fits into

389
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:01,080
our technical and growing security

390
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,950
portfolio for all the reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might</font>

391
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:08,309
imagine now all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> areas reported</font>

392
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:10,590
under<font color="#CCCCCC"> occam and as we felt that with the</font>

393
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:12,510
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld program the registry and</font>

394
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:15,449
registrar operations were going to grow

395
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:17,520
quite significantly we felt that<font color="#E5E5E5"> achren</font>

396
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:20,100
should be focused there we promoted him

397
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:24,030
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> president and we created the new</font>

398
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:28,260
division now the admin side is now run

399
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:32,330
by our new chief operating officer

414
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,090
web and it's open<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm looking for a</font>

415
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,920
leader for that area but let me talk

416
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the registry and register our area</font>

417
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,800
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is essentially what now is being</font>

418
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:27,330
called the generic domain division and I

419
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,580
know some of you already gave me input

420
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,379
which I pass to a crumb that maybe

421
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,840
division is not the right word<font color="#E5E5E5"> we may</font>

422
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,179
rename it to something else like unit or

423
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:40,980
that's fine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me just explain the</font>

424
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:44,010
spirit of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> first needless to say</font>

425
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,090
since<font color="#CCCCCC"> i arrived at ICANN the new gTLD</font>

426
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,960
program

427
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:50,399
has pretty much taken a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my oxygen</font>

428
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,530
frankly it's taken a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the oxygen</font>

429
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,090
of the organization now that's an

430
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:56,129
important thing and that's why when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

431
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,800
arrived we said let's focus on this

432
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:02,220
let's make it happen and it is happening

433
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:04,760
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we also need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to attend to the</font>

434
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,860
rest of I cans mission and goals and

435
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,470
functions and so by creating this new

436
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:13,889
division we're giving room for the rest

449
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:50,550
as we said<font color="#CCCCCC"> before this lateral</font>

450
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,820
inclusiveness to work like a relational

451
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:55,860
database and to bring everybody together

452
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:58,200
to work on that side of the house but on

count on us that trusted I can to

actually do the work and therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

to serve the same user we are united in

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,600
that goal we're not separated now that

465
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,280
at times means we will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

475
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:05,640
I think we're clear on that and that's

476
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:07,380
the spirit and the modus operandi<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:15,720
about this division compliance

00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:19,020
contractual compliance will remain

480
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,240
reporting to me it will not move into

00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">the new division while it may coordinate</font>

482
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,830
with the new division and get synced up

483
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:28,740
so that they can do their work but it

484
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,960
will remain reporting to me I promised

485

you that and I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep that promise i</font>

493
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:51,900
this is important having said that and

now I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our partners the</font>

513
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:56,340
know if my colleague<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doc Sweden is</font>

514
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:59,430
here then he hurts but I see some other

515
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:03,360
colleagues from the ctfd community but

516
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:05,580
Danny a year ago and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't know him</font>

517
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,979
and not a year ago pardon me a few

518
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:11,320
months ago four or five<font color="#CCCCCC"> months ago wrote</font>

519
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:13,570
a blog in Swedish I don't treat Swedish

520
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,000
but the head of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> french sis TLD</font>

521
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:18,429
retweeted that blog and said hey this is

522
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,120
important you should read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw that</font>

523
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:27,660
tweet I chased it got the blog read it

524
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:30,790
and the blog said I can is Janice faced

525
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:32,620
so I called Benny and I said Danny walk

526
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:35,379
me through<font color="#CCCCCC"> this I need to understand why</font>

527
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:37,179
you wrote this Janice faced for those of

528
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,160
us who<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what that is means you</font>

529
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:41,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">are kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of two-faced we have two faces</font>

530
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,620
I said why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think we have two</font>

531
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:46,840
faces he says you always have two faces

532
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:49,810
because on one end you<font color="#CCCCCC"> must work</font>

533
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,820
bottom-up multi-stakeholder and slowed

534
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:54,490
down to let everyone be part of the

535
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:57,610
solution on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other part we need you</font>

536
00:25:54,490 --> 00:26:00,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be the one making sure that the</font>

537
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:04,629
public interest is maintained and the

538
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,940
licensees who have licenses to operate

539
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,920
these deities are actually managed

540
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,810
properly serviced properly but managed

541
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:14,190
also properly and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> says these two</font>

542
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:17,350
things will always make you too fast and

543
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:20,350
so I immediately asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> him to help us</font>

544
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:23,050
fix this and we spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> time with him and</font>

545
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:26,310
with his colleagues and they guided us

546
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:29,830
this is the kind of cooperation we need

547
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:31,960
they helped us and hence we have a new

548
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:35,310
division and hopefully we won't be

549
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,310
called Janus faced again

550
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:43,630
focus on the registrant and the new

551
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,210
registry and registrar agreement this

552
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:49,000
gentleman signed the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Registrar agreement</font>

553
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:51,250
includes a registrant rights and

554
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,220
responsibilities document for the first

555
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:56,500
time written in plain English and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

556
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,299
to thank James and godaddy for helping

557
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,700
us with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of it they helped us</font>

558
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:02,679
write it in plain English so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font>

559
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,659
registrant could read it and understand

560
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:08,049
what are my rights and responsibilities

561
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:10,390
and note a registrant has rights but

562
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:12,520
also has responsibilities because our

563
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:16,630
ultimate responsibility is to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

user who trusts us to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

565
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:22,840
is serviced properly so thank you all of

566
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:26,710
you for helping us make that focus our

567
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:30,370
central focus moving forward my last bit

568
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:32,440
is about the strategic planning now this

569
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:35,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> part where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> frankly we can look to</font>

570
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,240
the future together and you know we

571
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:40,000
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conversation on strategy in</font>

572
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,820
Beijing and that conversation continues

573
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,190
we had a number of meetings and these

574
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,960
meetings have been very important and we

575
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:49,270
will have more today but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

576
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,710
remind you<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said in Beijing this</font>

577
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:57,879
is not about<font color="#CCCCCC"> changing why we exist and</font>

578
00:27:53,710 --> 00:28:00,700
what we do this is about how we do what

579
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:04,480
we're supposed to do so all we're doing

580
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:08,440
is reaffirming our why and what and then

581
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:13,149
retooling how we get things done this is

582

00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:25,299
where the board worked together to

587
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:28,149
actually give us some input into this

588
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:30,070
strategy planning process right<font color="#E5E5E5"> after I</font>

589
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:31,449
get off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage and I'm sure Denise</font>

need<font color="#E5E5E5"> your input for the strategy to make</font>

601
00:28:53,330 --> 00:29:00,500
sense now this strategy will move on and

602
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:02,600
will include<font color="#CCCCCC"> your input as we go and</font>

603
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:06,019
there's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come all the way till</font>

604
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:08,719
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of this year as i was getting</font>

605
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:11,659
input from you online it became very

606
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,870
clear that there are a few areas where

607
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:17,500
we will have some not we will have we

608
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:21,110
need to have some difficult discussions

609
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:24,529
amongst us and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are important areas</font>

610
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:26,408
and so I discussed with my team and with

611
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:29,539
the board how best to address these

612
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:32,210
difficult areas and by difficult i don't

613
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:35,120
mean intractable or impossible I simply

614
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:39,500
mean ones that require depth and a

615
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:44,449
little more time together now to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that</font>

616
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:48,500
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have decided to create with you in</font>

617
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:51,830
the next few months together five I can

618
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:54,710
strategy panels and these I can't

619
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:58,059
strategy panels will be places where we

620
00:29:54,710 --> 00:30:02,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">the community together come and discuss</font>

621
00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:04,870
key issues on strategy these panels will

622
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:08,120
inform the strategic planning process

623
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:10,370
they will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide anything they're</font>

624
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:14,870
just informative they're giving us input

625
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:17,600
and these panels are you in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

626
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:20,479
asked the board and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the staff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that none</font>

628
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,850
community panels these are you that's

629
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:29,268
why we call them I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can strategy panels</font>

630
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:31,789
now here are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the five panels and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

631
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:34,010
walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> you through them the first one will</font>

632
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:37,429
be a panel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that defines our public</font>

633
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:41,629
responsibility framework I must tell you

634
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:44,510
if I ask each of you what is I can't

635
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:46,399
public responsibility framework I may

636
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:49,429
get a thousand five hundred answers

637
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:53,299
maybe a thousand but we are still as a

638
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:55,519
community not clearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> united around what</font>

639
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:57,559
is exactly our public responsibility

640
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:01,250
framework and this will become important

641
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:02,240
as we decide maybe maybe not in the

642
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,870
months and years

643
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,970
up to expand not our<font color="#E5E5E5"> mission but our</font>

644
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:10,280
work and our activities in areas of

645
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:14,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">public responsibility we must define</font>

646
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:16,820
that framework this particular panel

647
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:19,100
will focus on that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I invite you any</font>

technology discussion back into the

00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:43,070
community I am I was frankly tired of

655
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:45,020
hearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> hush hush all the time oh we're</font>

roadmap of identifiers stew having said

that i do not think this will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be solved</font>

664
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,470
by ICANN getting a chief technology

officer on board because this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

community with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our partners at the IETF</font>

668
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:22,450
and the other great organizations need

00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:25,639
to come together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually talk about</font>

670
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:28,309
technology this is what this panel will

671
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,710
do and will give us a road map will give

672
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:32,740
us a context for understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

673
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:35,720
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a technology not technical</font>

00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:40,790
technology standpoint we need to be and

675
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:44,270
we will be the third panel will look at

676
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:46,659
our multi-stakeholder model or I should

677
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,580
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that back our multi-stakeholder</font>

678
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:53,030
system our multi-stakeholder

680
00:32:53,030 --> 00:33:00,800
of you come to me and they say this esso

681
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:03,890
is not working the PDP is too slow and I

682
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:07,309
immediately asked what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you comparing</font>

683
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:10,250
it to well we don't know it takes two

684
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:12,320
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah it also takes 18 years to</font>

685
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:15,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">grow child so I mean what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

686
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,269
comparing two years to

687
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,929
and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't have answers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

688
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:25,340
this they simply say it takes too long

689
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:28,250
but frankly<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't know what we are</font>

690
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:30,879
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical of ourselves sometimes</font>

691
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:33,830
when we really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> step back and say</font>

692
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,860
how do we look at this in a more

693
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:38,510
structured way how do we understand what

694
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,918
are the right structures what is the

695
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:44,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">right process for us to move forward</font>

696
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:47,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> panel will focus on that the fourth</font>

697
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:49,820
panel will focus on our place I can't

698
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,630
place and role in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

700
00:33:53,630 --> 00:34:00,590
good coordination with our internet

705
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,828
evolve our relationship with them what

706
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:24,679
is our place with them in the years to

707
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:27,020
come this is an important question and

708
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:29,740
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand it and it's</font>

709
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:32,989
important by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I can</font>

710
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:38,299
frankly sometimes due to its size and

711
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:41,750
its momentum now<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be causing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> harm to</font>

712
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:44,210
ourselves and to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecosystem by not</font>

713
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:46,429
being well synchronized so it's very

714
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:48,710
important we take a step back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say</font>

715
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:51,800
how do we make this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work moving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forward</font>

716
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:54,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">we are not going to be answering the</font>

717
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,690
next circle well which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the circle</font>

718
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:59,119
about our place<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the world of internet</font>

719
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:00,109
governance between our relationships

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,270
with governments and international

721
00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:05,089
governmental organizations we won't

722
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:07,490
answer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> question well if that middle</font>

00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:10,609
circle is not answered well so first

724
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:13,490
let's figure out in our family how we're

725

going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our family of</font>

726
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:18,078

transparency and engagement and

746
00:36:09,029 --> 00:36:13,680

747
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:15,749
but we are doing better we are moving in

order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help me build them and create</font>

751
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:28,470
them i will be bringing some chair

752
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,269
people to do that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will tell you</font>

753
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:33,118
who they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are but first let me explain</font>

754
00:36:30,269 --> 00:36:35,640
that these panels are not divorced from

755
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the community</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they are in the community</font>

756
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,739
and they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be filled with people from</font>

757
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,630
the community as well we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have other</font>

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from outside the community as</font>

759
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:48,779
well to inform us to give us an

762
00:36:51,749 --> 00:36:59,519
and grow<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to note that i</font>

763
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,970
intend for these communities to stay

764
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:06,680
these panels to stay small so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

765
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:10,200
have these at most with seven people

766
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:13,200
with a chair not always a female but

767
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,149
hopefully some females and then we will

768
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">have on the outside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that an executive</font>

769
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,920
sponsor so for each of these will have

770
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,410
one of the icon executives to support

771
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,900
and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that committee gets the</font>

772
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:27,058
support it needs to achieve its goal the

00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:30,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">committee's will also last for no more</font>

774
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:33,569
than a year so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> already put a clear</font>

775
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:38,149
time limit for them they will be one

776
00:37:33,569 --> 00:37:40,339
hundred percent transparent and anyone

777
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:42,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask to talk to them and give them their</font>

informed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these major issues I also</font>

an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the expert working group</font>

783
00:37:55,490 --> 00:38:00,669
initially until we clarified it these

00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:03,950
committees have no decision power and

785
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:07,010
what comes out of these panels doesn't

786
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:10,368
come to me it goes to all of you it goes

787
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:12,380
to all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us so we take it and we decide</font>

what to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it it might lead to a</font>

00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:22,640
might lead to<font color="#CCCCCC"> other things but nothing</font>

792
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:25,129
will come out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these panels and go</font>

793
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,529
straight to implementation everything

794
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:31,190
will come through us and will inform us

795
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:33,619
as we build both our strategy for the

next few months and then the operating

strategic plan feeding into a three-year

806
00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:00,859
operating plan that then feeds into the

yearly budgeting and planning process

808
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:04,788
that defines what we do in every year

809
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:07,220
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

operating plan done that's the plan now

813
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:18,819

<font color="#CCCCCC">identifier technology I asked well who</font>

00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:19,029

836
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:40,690
tricky one because if we're talking

about structures and how we make policy

838
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:46,570
it becomes a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tougher to get</font>

someone who is frankly has been in this

840
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:51,940
room for a long time so we many of us

841
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:55,590
will have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that panel but we</font>

842
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:58,660
thought that if we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> an external new</font>

innovation oriented person to lead this

it would be good so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may not know</font>

845
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:07,149
this lady but her name is Beth Simone

Novick she's a professor at New York

847

University Beth is a remarkable

848

innovator she wrote a book called wiki

government she also in that book she

850
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:23,650
describes how she completely changed the

00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:52,289
with consensus models sounds familiar

861
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:55,799
she was presented with six potential

00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:19,680

874
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:42,150
one who best can help us understand how

00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:44,098
to make icons row well measured in the

00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:46,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet organization ecosystem and I</font>

877
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:48,869
use the word measure carefully because I

878
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:51,630
can should not do more than its supposed

879
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:54,059
to do we're not building and I can

<font color="#E5E5E5">Empire this is not our intent we just</font>

881
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:58,109
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what is the right measure</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet organization ecosystem and</font>

884
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:08,549

this ecosystem and all of you know vent
