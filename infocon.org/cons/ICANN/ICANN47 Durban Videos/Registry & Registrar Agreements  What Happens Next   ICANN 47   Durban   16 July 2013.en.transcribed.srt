1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
Cyrus we're here at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exhibition area</font>

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,420
at the durban meeting a lot of the buzz

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,120
that's going on in this room<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,219
throughout<font color="#CCCCCC"> the halls is about the</font>

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">registrar accreditation agreement and</font>

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:18,630
the registry agreement what<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly do</font>

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,789
those mean yeah the this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,580
conference in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Durban Brad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is a</font>

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,189
very special<font color="#CCCCCC"> one because we now are at</font>

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">an inflection point in the life of the</font>

11
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,198
<font color="#CCCCCC">new gtld program because we managed to</font>

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually get the new raa and a new</font>

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,670
register agreement approved by the board

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,328
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> before the conference and that's</font>

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:42,600
significant to folks number one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

16
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,879
it enables the contractual framework for

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,710
the delegation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ug</font>

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,570
so that's a very very significant

19
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,460
milestone for the whole program that's

20
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,710
been in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> making really for years and</font>

21
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,739
then the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is that the new</font>

22
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:01,750
contracts actually provided much more

23
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:03,820
improved quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> of service and level of</font>

24
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,430
standards for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the contracting parties</font>

25
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,790
which benefits ultimately the register

26
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,250
on

27
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,110
so from this these two perspectives we

28
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,990
have actually managed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to raise the bar</font>

29
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,789
on the whole industry as we get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

30
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,830
last mile<font color="#E5E5E5"> of delegating UT</font>

31
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,100
so we have taught that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can forever</font>

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,470
about in terms of process we've always

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,300
said you have initial evaluation then

34
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">you enter it into a contracting phase</font>

35
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,920
then you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> bri delegation testing</font>

36
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,900
what I'm hearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say is these two</font>

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,150
agreements set up the foundation for

38
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,280
that contracting face is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if / /</font>

39
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,979
some days are the mechanism for the

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">contract which then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enable us actually</font>

41
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,690
into the next phase which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font>

42
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">delegation testing and a number of other</font>

43
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,369
aspects that are involved in and

44
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:52,650
ultimately the recommendation by<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyeq</font>

45
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,990
into I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anna which is the last step</font>

46
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:58,500
before the new GT of the unity

47
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,880
delegation in to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sara you just</font>

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,310
mentioned that it sets up some

49
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,070
provisions that are beneficial to the

50
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,740
registrant's the people who want those

51
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,109
domains<font color="#CCCCCC"> sighs those domain names what</font>

52
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,850
for instance a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them that's a</font>

53
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,730
very good question for instance in the

54
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:17,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raa there was requirements from the</font>

enforcement agency

58
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,580
to weed out the bad actors in our

59
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:29,179
industry so those have been incorporated

60
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:32,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">complete concert with the registrar's</font>

61
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,170
there is also a register on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> register</font>

62
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,420
register<font color="#CCCCCC"> ons benefits and</font>

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,760
responsibilities document which we've

64
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,649
actually put in plain language english

65
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,260
today that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be translating that into</font>

66
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,720
other languages which sets out in

<font color="#E5E5E5">layman's terms the rights benefits and</font>

69
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,720
is incorporated into the contract so

these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the examples of the</font>

new friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we incorporated it has</font>

72
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,690
taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long time to get these</font>

73
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,910
agreements years I mean it's been going

74
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,640
on and on the expression that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you used</font>

75
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,680
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear in the exhibition area in the</font>

76
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,299
halls<font color="#CCCCCC"> at other dyke I can mean exist</font>

77
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,730
it's been kicked down the road it's been

78
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:15,840
kicked down with why was it so difficult

79
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:18,299
to get these two agreements to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">the i kin community by definition</font>

81
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,989
consists of many many different<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspects</font>

82
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,940
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stakeholders that people make up</font>

83
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:28,740
the universal

84
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,959
so you have the operators who ultimately

85
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,940
become the contracted parties they have

86
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,250
their own goals ambitions the generous

87
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,560
you have the law enforcement agencies

88
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,550
you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy-making missions or</font>

89
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,739
the government's you have the

90
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,310
government's themselves to actually be

91
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,900
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put all of these different</font>

92
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:48,180
constituencies into the same room and

93
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,100
come out with one message it's something

94
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">that just takes time to build that</font>

95
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,810
consensus is a time-consuming thing and

96
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,690
we've managed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that over the years</font>

97
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:01,530
and really have kicked it up in terms of

98
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">speed and its ability to deliver in the</font>

99
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,769
last six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so because the</font>

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,290
community as a whole healer came

101
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:09,360
together and started making compromises

102
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,459
started actually thinking out of the box

103
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">and resolving some of your friend issues</font>

104
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,900
and the result of it is these two ideas

105
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,399
that you see today what's coming back

106
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,048
and you as you go through the halls is

107
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,209
your attend<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meetings as you go here</font>

110
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,750
are you getting a lot of white in shoes

positive and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it thats fun part of</font>

115
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,400
that is that it's coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from different</font>

support the army and these are typically

every facet of our stakeholder community

<font color="#CCCCCC">people and there seems to be at least a</font>

minimal amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of confusion as to the</font>

exemptions for people for operators to

147
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,150
adhere to their local laws when it comes

148
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,950
to some privacy related issues and that

149
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,340
has already been anticipated and

150
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:01,760

151
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:04,429
so I expect it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be smooth sailing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

152
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,800
here on in terms of people including

153
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">with Jack and law enforcement or any</font>

154
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,000

156
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,490

157
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,250
been your mission now you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

158
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,260
agreements so here at the meeting are

159
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,210
you walking around trying to get buy-in

160
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,490
or what's your role now are you sitting

161
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">up at the swimming pool nice Janet I</font>

wish I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can hear you know no other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

163
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,070
is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning because as</font>

164
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:33,770
I said earlier we now have the

165
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:35,750
contractual framework for people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

166
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,659
in to sign the contract and essentially

167
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:41,740
get into the queue for delegation of new

168
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:44,330
gTLDs so the work is shifting now from

169
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,669
getting the contracts in place to

170
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:49,099
actually making sure that all day for

171
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:51,320
instance register ours are aware of the

172

providing training<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them in China</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

176
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,500
instance in<font color="#E5E5E5"> August in Chinese language</font>

177
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,510
because the document agreement is

178
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,490
written in English and here the Chinese

179
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,250
community tradition has not been as

180
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,350
