actually any doubt that i can was going

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,559
to get this contract there was really no

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,720
say you know what other people were

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:12,060
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was unique this time that</font>

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,890
department of commerce went through a

30
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,900
competitive procurement process as

31
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,180
opposed to what they've done in the past

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,939
which has been a sole source or selected

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,960
source procurement and so that at least

34
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,750
raised the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that one of</font>

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,429
the benefits<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is that it makes it</font>

36
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:36,600
clear to everybody that that we are

37
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:38,850
legitimately the best group to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,548
<font color="#E5E5E5">job and that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very strong statement</font>

39
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:47,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">can we say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that digital our jury is now</font>

dead<font color="#E5E5E5"> digital archery is is dead I think</font>

41
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,490
that's pretty clear but<font color="#CCCCCC"> even more</font>

42
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,020
broadly it's a question of if not

43
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,880
digital archery than what and it's it's

44
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,250
not clear that we need anything like

45
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,408
that we can put everything together in

46
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,780
one batch leads to some subsequent

47
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,360
questions about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use sequence the</font>

48
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,730
output<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the evaluation process in</font>

49
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,700
two delegations into the roots

50
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,530
but there's quite a vibrant dialogue

51
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,170
about how to how to solve that and how

52
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:23,010
to orchestrate the that process<font color="#CCCCCC"> akram</font>

53
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:26,890
why was digital archery so problematic

54
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,599
digital archery we started about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

55
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,208
weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> before the meeting started here</font>

56
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:33,459
and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time we got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the meeting</font>

57
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:36,099
there was only twenty percent of the

58
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:39,160
applicants that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> already taken the</font>

59
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:41,679
digital archery and recorded that time

60
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:45,459
stamps what we were worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is</font>

61
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,190
that we saw some instability in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in</font>

62
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:50,260
the tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we were worried that with</font>

63
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,959
eighty percent of the applicants having

64
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:56,798
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the last four or five days</font>

65
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the process would create some</font>

66
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,190
additional problem and instability and

67
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:04,120
we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be fair</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to all applicants</font>

68
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:06,160
and make sure they all have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good test</font>

69
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,370
and the good time stamp and that's why

70
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,549
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> decided to marry that with the</font>

71
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,739
concerns that were in the public<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

72
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:17,250
decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspend the dish largely</font>

73
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:20,109
under week until we gather the

74
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,660
community's input and decide on<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we</font>

want to go forward the the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld</font>

76
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,190
application window is obviously closed

77
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:30,429
we're now into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> period of evaluation</font>

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:34,720
comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and objection give us an update</font>

79
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:38,620
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> started the evaluation we are</font>

80
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:42,720
working on evaluating and calibrating

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:45,910
all of the panels so that we get uniform

82

84
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,720
doing another round of that and then we

85
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,940
were going to start the earnest tea with

earlier in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> week it was announced</font>

100
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,700
there are many people who complain for

example about the United States posture

102

and various matters and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> committed</font>

Task Force had a a meeting in Beijing

two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and it was a first-class</font>

110
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,430
they are as a sensitive as any group in

nothing but first class success and

we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at ways to move the</font>

the of the position and organization

144
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:59,200
during that the time were before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new</font>

145
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:02,080
CEO takes over and I'm up to the

146
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,630
challenge Steve these sorts of

147
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,030
transitions are difficult enough now we

148
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:10,060
have a departing CEO we have an interim

149
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:13,809
CEO and we've got the next CEO coming

150
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:16,870
after that why do it this way it's it's

151
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:19,810
not as big a problem as you're

152
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:25,480
suggesting we have actually orchestrated

153
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:28,480
a quite smooth sequence fadi chehade and

154
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:31,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">Akram</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> atala have had the benefit of</font>

155
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:35,260
knowing each other working with each

156
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:37,380
other before<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fadi is although not</font>

157
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:41,349
available to come on board<font color="#E5E5E5"> to full-time</font>

158
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,409
is available for a limited amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

159
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:46,810
service and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in learning mode and</font>

160
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:49,870
consulting and so forth so I'm actually

161
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:52,990
expecting to quite seamless transitions

162
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,760
one right now and and then another one

163
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,270
and I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to</font>

164
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,950
see any real problems coming out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of any</font>

165
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this during your speech at the</font>

166
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:05,050
welcoming ceremony you said that

167
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,719
transition is not an excuse for standing

168
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,890
still what exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> did you mean so we</font>

169
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,050
have a lot of initiatives that are

170
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:14,200
underway not the least of them is the

171
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:17,290
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld program and we cannot just wait</font>

172
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,539
and did not achieve our goals for the

173
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:22,960
next three months and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

174
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:25,360
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we that in three months the</font>

175
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,780
organization has moved ahead and not

176
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,190
stayed where it was before we started

177
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,929
number one priority for the next three

178
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:36,849
months is the new GED program and our

179
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:39,520
operational excellence Steve when you

180
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:41,709
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> back at the Prague meeting what</font>

181
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:46,310
stands out most in your mom

182
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:49,609
well you know too obvious things are

183
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:53,180
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the first meeting after the</font>

184
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,500
window closed on the gTLDs and the names

185
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,420
are revealed and so forth so that

186
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:01,100
clearly dominated a lot of conversation

187
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,259
the other thing of course is that this

188
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:07,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">is where we announced the selection of</font>

189
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:12,610
the CEO that was a process<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

190
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:16,930
kicked off 10 months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago a little more</font>

191
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:19,940
when mr. bextrum announced that he was

192
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:21,859
affirmative<font color="#CCCCCC"> lee completing his contract</font>

193
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,430
and then would be leaving on july first

194
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:28,940
and the board has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been working far</font>

195
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:31,819
harder than as visible to organize<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

196
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:37,639
conduct a worldwide search very

197
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:39,589
intensively and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think with pleased</font>

198
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:41,540
very pleased<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the results that we</font>

199
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:43,759
have and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody's looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

fatty<font color="#E5E5E5"> shadi to the community is</font>

202
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,388

203
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:55,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">this meeting and those two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are in</font>

204
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:58,579
a way a little bit distracting from the

205
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,670
huge range of the regular business that

206
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:04,939
we carry on every meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> akram in</font>

210
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:22,160
enjoyable and busy as well as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

211
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:24,860
feeling the pressure<font color="#CCCCCC"> of making sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

212
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,250
we deliver on our commitments so it's

213
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:31,399
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> very active and very busy but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

214
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:34,069
not unusual it's like every<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

215
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:37,089
meeting we come together and there's a

216
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:40,459
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of debate and a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues serve</font>

217
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:43,310
bubble up to the surface and it's all
