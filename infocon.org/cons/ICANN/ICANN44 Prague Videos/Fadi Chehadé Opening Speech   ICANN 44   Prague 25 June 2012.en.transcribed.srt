00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,459
is what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my identity not my identity</font>

19
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,430
card and as the great author I mean

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,339
Maloof wrote your identity is really

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,080
what you've done it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> collection of</font>

22
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,048
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you've done in your</font>

the Arab Spring coming to lead I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

28
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,369
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going on here I think you just</font>

29
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:29,729
read where I've been and that will tell

30
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:32,610
you who I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am so my identity is within me</font>

31
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,189
and i will bring everything I've done to

32
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:39,380
the service of I can and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

33
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:42,298
important part but in practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

34
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,220
born of Egyptian parents who moved

35
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,950
around the world they lived in Addis

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,079
Abeba and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sudan a little bit and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

37
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,930
in Cairo and then moved to Beirut and

38
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,750
that's where I was born and grew up in

39
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,840
Beirut in a very French part of Beirut

40
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,820
so even as a child<font color="#E5E5E5"> the little nuns made</font>

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,070
sure that I spoke French till noon and

42
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,898
if I spoke Arabic in the morning I was

43
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,820
going to be sent to the room and<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

44
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,009
some milk in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my ears and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the my school</font>

45
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,739
will come so we only spoke French

46
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:13,760
and then in the afternoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> I became</font>

47
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:18,020
completely Arabic I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak</font>

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">French so even then my identity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

49
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,480
already being formed and I'd go home and

50
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:26,000
I have Egyptian parents who were from a

51
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,739
minority of Coptic Christians in Egypt

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,510
that had left Egypt in the 1940s so this

53
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,330
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the experience of growing</font>

54
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:38,959
up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a war-torn country where I had to</font>

55
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:42,250
learn obviously to lose everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

56
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:46,130
lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends to lose what I grew up with</font>

57
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:49,760
and being whisked out of Beirut during a

58
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:52,400
very difficult time my dad found<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

59
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,179
that some of my friends were telling me

60
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,860
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use guns at the age of 13 so</font>

61
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:01,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">supposedly I could defend our little</font>

62
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:05,390
city and so he put me<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little lorie</font>

63
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:08,540
and shipped me to Damascus and said

64
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't come back and I actually didn't I</font>

65
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,850
came in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> out back to Beirut but the</font>

66
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,299
war was still going on until as you know

67
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:19,100
quite late and then I frankly want to

68
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,900
tell you this because many people look

69
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:25,370
at this experience and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say how horrible</font>

70
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:27,890
i look at it and say how lucky how lucky

71
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,160
to have had this experience to learn

72
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:33,529
what is important at this age and to

73
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,930
grow up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> United States</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

74
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:39,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">embrace a brand new culture I arrived to</font>

75
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:43,970
the US I did not speak English I was 18

76
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:48,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and my first job</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was to peel onions I</font>

77
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:51,560
did that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for seven months was remarkable</font>

78
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:55,950
tried to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for three days</font>

79
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:59,220
it's painful but it taught me many

80
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:02,010
things and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did go to school to learn</font>

81
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">English at the time and grew from that</font>

82
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:09,660
experience to learn of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the generosity of</font>

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:15,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">the world an alone young man in a place</font>

84
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:17,700
of linguistic limitations grow<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and so</font>

85
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:19,859
many people supporting me so many people

86
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">helping me I was talking yesterday</font>

87
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:25,710
someone here who used to be at Bell Labs

88
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:28,919
a place I stopped by along the way and I

89
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,530
shared with<font color="#E5E5E5"> her how 80 covered all my</font>

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:34,530
expenses to go to Stanford University

91
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,630
and paid<font color="#CCCCCC"> my salary while I was there and</font>

92
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:40,979
then it asked me to come back and work

93
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:42,990
for them they said you know just go do

94
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,750
the right thing and when you finish and

95
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:49,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">you gain this knowledge use a 12 this is</font>

96
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:53,100
remarkable<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the generosity that I</font>

97

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,770
told I'm going to do this told me that I

145
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,950
should check my head that this would not

146
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:27,729
be possible within 40 days the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 28</font>

151
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,800
here Rosetta is the stone that was found

152
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,530
in Egypt a couple hundred years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:55,430
Rosetta Stone has three languages on it

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,530
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important it's not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">about creating a single language we all</font>

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:13,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">the message neither I can know Rosetta</font>

things

00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:19,820
and anyone countries view of things it

166
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,460
is about an understanding it is about

167
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,340
how we come together to listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:29,359
other and build things together this is

177
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:55,069
the reason I am here today there is no

other<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I love doing this bringing</font>

179
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,590
communities that on the face of it could

180
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:04,700
never be brought together to agree on

181
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:08,060
common things is exactly what I strive

182
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:11,180
to do and I do it not just here I do it

183
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:14,329
in my community in my church and also in

184
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:17,569
my home in my family this is what drives

185
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,820
me and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is foundational for</font>

186
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,520
the multi-stakeholder environment if we

187
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:27,410
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not start with this we will only</font>

188
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:31,550
deliver words we will not do it and I am

189
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:34,069
all about inclusion and inclusion starts

190
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:38,949
by stepping out of the organization and

191
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:42,890
looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from the outside not being</font>

192
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:44,750
inside and seeing everything our way so

193
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:48,080
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we need to do and I will</font>

194
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:51,200
do is I will step outside and look from

195
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,870
the outside in and listen and include

196
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,800
everyone that needs to be brought into I

197
00:09:53,870 --> 00:10:03,500
can from the beginning from day<font color="#CCCCCC"> one this</font>

198
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:05,449
will be in my DNA in how I will work now

199
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,610
those of you who appreciate the

200
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:11,030
multi-stakeholder model would say this

201
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:13,520
is much harder it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier there</font>

202
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:17,030
are other<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier ways to do things yes</font>

203
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:20,210
this is not easy this is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

204
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:24,949
require patience and hard work but

205
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:25,520
frankly it yields a much richer value to

206
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,420
everybody

207
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:36,319
when we do it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is harder but we</font>

208
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:38,990
will do it I come besides<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rosetta net</font>

209
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,430
and all my personal endeavors in the

210
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:46,730
nonprofit world I come from a business

211
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:52,939
mindset which says that decisions must

212
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:56,930
be made clearly deliberately and in a

213
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:59,630
strong approach I will do this with the

214
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:02,030
team I'm not known<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make decisions on</font>

215
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:05,660
my own in fact I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been reproached</font>

216
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:09,140
about that I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to involve the whole</font>

217
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:11,030
community to listen then a strong team

218
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,860
to help me<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrive to the right</font>

219
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,170
conclusions then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will present these to</font>

220
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:18,020
the community and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will manage the</font>

221
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:21,110
staff with a very strong decision making

222
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:25,810
model from the beginning and we need

223
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,810
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> today we have a lot of work ahead I</font>

224
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:32,180
care much more about getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things done</font>

225
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:35,420
then about figuring out who should get

226
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:37,969
the credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on getting</font>

227
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,790
things done and this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to</font>

228
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,670
do today and finally I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

229
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:46,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">that mutual understanding is an area</font>

230
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:50,270
that I will invest a lot of time and I

231
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:53,870
saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> yesterday the GAC meeting and how</font>

232
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:55,850
the dialogue can actually get us all

233
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:58,700
much closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understanding what is</font>

234
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:02,630
worrying us I shared<font color="#CCCCCC"> with some of the</font>

235
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:05,030
members of the GAC after the meeting my

236
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:08,000
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> my listening as to what's</font>

237
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,350
happening in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> room and what are</font>

238
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,260
their worries and I will do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

239
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:15,110
with the gns oh and all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other s 0</font>

240
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,630
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> AC groups mutual listening and</font>

241
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:20,080
understanding is fundamental to my

242
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,080
values

243
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:28,479
I'm new to all of this and today<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

244
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:32,260
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not get many exact specific roadmap</font>

245
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,050
items from me by Toronto I will be ready

246
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:39,189
and I will spend the next three months

247
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:41,140
getting ready but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will tell you there</font>

248
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:44,200
are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that I must bring up</font>

249
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:49,080
today that are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important from what</font>

250
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:52,839
I've seen the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can is an</font>

251
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:55,740
international organization and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> must</font>

252
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:59,710
strive to make it international and

253
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:02,680
that's not dressing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not an</font>

254
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:05,610
office in another country that is not

255
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:10,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I speak four languages being</font>

256
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:13,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">international is from inside out it's</font>

257
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:17,430
understanding from the ground up how

258
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:21,990
other cultures think how other people

259
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:24,339
manage and how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

260
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:27,580
understanding that not all of us have

261
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:29,980
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same access I spent time yesterday</font>

262
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,860
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> African delegation with the</font>

263
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:37,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">Latin American delegation and I heard</font>

264
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:40,870
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I felt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very earning to be</font>

265
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:43,690
reached and I will spend time doing this

266
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:47,380
this is important and I will ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

267
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:50,190
our people see it from the inside out as

268
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:53,200
an international endeavor it's Who I am

269
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:56,290
just look at my background just look at

270
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,000
my confused identity if you may call it

271
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:01,949
although I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't find it confused I</font>

272
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,790
simply find it broad and I find it to be

273
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:11,110
encompass entities are and we will do

274
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:15,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same at I can so we will integrate</font>

275
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:18,870
everything in our daily work to make it

276
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">international from day one</font>

277
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,150
second thing

278
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:29,439
all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could say are</font>

279
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:35,690
meaningless if I can does not operate

280
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:39,380
with excellence so meaningless people

281
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:42,140
process systems fortunately or

282
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:45,380
unfortunately I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> also trained at IBM</font>

283
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:48,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">and at bell labs and you put these</font>

284
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:51,740
things together and you do them calmly

285
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:56,060
steadfastly with a lot of precision and

286
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:59,390
we will deliver we cannot be expected to

287
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:02,089

thank you

310
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:14,630
look these are times of great change for

311
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:18,050
the icon community the very fact that

312
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:21,080
I'm here someone who did not grow up in

313
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,699
the icon community that's changed but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

314
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,570
do have the background<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet has</font>

315
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:28,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">been every part of what I've done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

316
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,190
have the technical background I used to

317
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:34,190
teach computer science so i will bring

318
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:37,880
all my qualities to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fore and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i will</font>

319
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:41,330
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the superb team that i met</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

320
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,160
the last few days to actually make sure

321
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,770
that this change doesn't bring us to our

322
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,589
knees but rather it becomes a moment of

323
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:51,829
greatness for us but in doing that and

324
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:57,470
in doing it in a steadfast structured

325
00:16:51,830 --> 00:17:01,790
way we cannot become a fortress<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

326
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:05,900
cannot become a fortress I can must

327
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:09,560
become an oasis a place that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people see</font>

328
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:13,570
and come to because it works because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

329
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:17,240
makes sense because it's efficient and

330
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:20,780
an oasis also because I can is part of

331
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:23,030
an ecosystem who are not alone we don't

332
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,839
run the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet in case anybody thought</font>

333
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:29,300
with it we're a part of an ecosystem of

334
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:32,810
companies of institutions of fora that

335
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:35,600
make this whole enterprise work this

336
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:37,310
sacred enterprise that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought so</font>

337
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,969
much to people you heard under I speak

338
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:44,090
about what it's done to them all of you

339
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:47,930

340
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:50,870
have to keep I can as an oasis and that

341
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:53,390
I hope is what I'm remembered by when

342
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:55,780
one day I pass the baton hopefully as

343
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:59,810
graciously as rod to the next person

344
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:03,080
that we open we keep I can't open just

345
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:05,750
as it is today and have it become an

346
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:10,460
attractive place the multi-stakeholder

347
