00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:31,989
is it going to continue in the future or

that I can board have consultations with

archery and batching and there are

62
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:58,239
numerous discussions taking place this

63
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,310
week and it will depend on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the feedback</font>

64
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,950
from the community where things go and

65
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:06,099
our Chairman Steve Crocker may have

66
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:10,000
additional points he wishes to share on

67
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:12,548
that thank you either certainly is the

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,379
the essence of it that decision has not

69
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:17,379
been made but there will be looked at

70
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:19,030
quite seriously we are of course in the

71
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:23,108
position<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we now know how many</font>

72
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:26,530
applications we have and so the decision

73
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:28,540
processes that took place before that

74
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,750
went down the path of choosing digital

75
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,429
archery are now able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> revisited and</font>

76
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,370
light out both the knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how many</font>

77
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,229
applications are coming and the new

78
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,599
advice that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming in from the GAC</font>

79
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:42,699
and from other quarters gns oh and so

80
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,510
forth that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that's appropriate to</font>

81
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:49,479
say at the moment but we obviously are

82
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,190
taking it quite seriously and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll go</font>

83
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,650
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a substantive process not a pro</font>

84
00:03:51,190 --> 00:04:02,728
forma process to decide what the next

85
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:02,729
step is we can take the next question

86
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:17,310
hi Monica airmont<font color="#CCCCCC"> heiser online you just</font>

87
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">said wrote that it was you received that</font>

88
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,060
letter of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that pulled the</font>

89
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:22,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">trigger but when yes in yesterday's</font>

90
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,010
session we understood and even from the

91
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,200
communication we understood that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

92
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,360
reason was a technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with the</font>

93
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">wither system so that would be my first</font>

94
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,430
one to let me perhaps so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> collect</font>

95
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,230
the questions on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the topic on that of</font>

96
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:41,730
the digital artery is a single batch are

97
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:44,250
something that you now consider really

98
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:48,450
seriously is it is it feasible is it

99
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:50,370
possible you said it depends from the

100
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,060
feedback from the community and will we

101
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,760
have the answer already on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thursday then</font>

102
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,740
on that or is there any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

103
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,409
alternative that that you are

104
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,140
considering and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might</font>

105
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:07,139
perhaps ask the question I asked last

106
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,510
time about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the politician perhaps rot</font>

107
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:14,940
you can answer that over over the time

108
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:17,789
you have been needy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can CEO did you</font>

109
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:23,010
see a poly ties ation of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can work</font>

110
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:26,280
five countries jurisdictions trying to

111
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:28,710
enforce laws extraterritorially by for

112
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,090
example I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example the</font>

113
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:35,039
domain seizures that we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

114
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:38,219
enforcing national law cross-border

115
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,200
because you have a possibility to go to

116
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,810
infrastructure providers sitting in your

117
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:49,860
country and is this a danger that you

118
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:54,990
see going forward and I ok I mean I

119
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:58,320
might come<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok let me take those one at a</font>

120
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,900
time first<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I didn't refer to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GAC</font>

121
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,169
letter as a trigger I what I said was

122
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,479
the question was it has been suspended

123
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:09,000
so what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen next within</font>

124
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,880
that context the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GAC letter is relevant</font>

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,640
because it's a formal request of advice

126
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,530
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> advice to the ICANN board to consult</font>

127
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,050
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community and so it needs to be</font>

128
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">done and it obviously has a factor in</font>

129
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,699
this equation so

130
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:26,479
the the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> was taken online for the</font>

131
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:29,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons stated online that you mentioned</font>

132
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,878
with respect to the question of national

133
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,680
policies obviously i can has always

134
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,050
supported an open unified global

135
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,210

136
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:43,159
principles and rfcs that have been

137
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:45,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">developed for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the domain name system</font>

138
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:47,310
different nation states do enact

139
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,680
different laws and take different

140
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,009
actions and their geographies and i

141
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,139
think that the i kin community often

142
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:57,659
engages members of the community not

143
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:00,289
necessarily under an<font color="#CCCCCC"> icann moniker or as</font>

144
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:04,080
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can body work to help educate</font>

145
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:06,628
lawmakers on some of the trade-offs and

146
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,240
some of the disadvantages of for example

147
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:10,919
DNS filtering and there are discussions

148
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,479
in the community even this week there's

149
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,628
a discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think on DNS filtering</font>

150
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,000
and blocking so there has been growing

151
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:21,689
pressure in many countries around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

Steve speak for the board as CEO I

155
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:32,759
haven't seen any appreciable change in

156
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:35,219
what we discuss or what we work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

controlling access to infringing sites

pretty clear at the same time i can has

not taken a specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> position on this</font>

bring to light to extend some of the

ideas that we sketched out earlier on

account comparable efforts in other

00:08:53,470 --> 00:09:03,399
provide advice that is informative to

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:08,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">policymakers so it's it's it's in that</font>

185
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:12,100
sort of intermediate region where there

186
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:15,490
is no I can position per se and I can is

187
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,769
not engaging in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a political effort but</font>

188
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:21,490
nonetheless the technical elements that

00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:24,310
underpin the adoption of such policies

190
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:26,170
are very important and within the i kin

191
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:30,029
community as i said we know how efforts

192
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:33,969
to bring those consequences to light and

193
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:38,230
and then that the rest has to be part of

194
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:45,819
a much<font color="#E5E5E5"> broader international debate and</font>

195
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:47,740
debates within individual countries and

196
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:50,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">Monica if I may you also had a question</font>

197
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,000
about 1 batt the possibility of one

198
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,209
batch or a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> batch and its</font>

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,430
implications and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm can best</font>

200
00:09:55,209 --> 00:10:04,589
speak to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you rod so one batch</font>

201
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:07,359
is feasible of course it depends on how

202
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:10,810
what the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the applicants</font>

203
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,540
would like to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> us do there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

204
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:17,430
alternative of multiple batches is that

205
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:20,529
you will start seeing the passing

206
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:22,899
applications out of it first batch for

207
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:25,569
example earlier than you would see them

208
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:27,850
if you do a whole batch the timing is

209
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:30,040
really what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the difference and if</font>

210
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:32,410
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to wait till</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

211
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,380
applications are processed then a single

212
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:39,579
batch could work as well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

213
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:42,069
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how things will go after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

214
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:43,370
initial evaluation into pre delegation

215
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:46,279
and

216
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:50,510
and contracts and as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as delegation</font>

217
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:53,210
itself so we the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue with one</font>

218
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">batch is that everything finishes at the</font>

219
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">same time and comes out at the same time</font>

220
00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:00,860
and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to depend on the</font>

221
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:03,740
natural trickling effects of these

222
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:06,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">processes to allow things to come to</font>

223
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,510
delegation in smaller chunks otherwise

224
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,490
you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything coming to</font>

225
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,200
delegation at the same time so these are

226
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues that we're grappling with and</font>

227
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,170
the board<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD committee is looking at</font>

228
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:20,029
all of that is listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the gac</font>

229
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,920
listen to the GAC yesterday and they

230
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:25,580
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be continuing their consultations</font>

231
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,380
with the community<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then when we when</font>

232
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,820
we get more information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they're</font>

233
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,080
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sit down and deliberate on that</font>

234
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:34,010
and we will see what the outcome is

235
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,900
everything is possible I think

236
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,700
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> is on the table and that's</font>

00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">rod said we know more now about the</font>

238
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,130
applications I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about as Steve</font>

239
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:45,500
said earlier as we know more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

240
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:48,560
applications the number how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many are in</font>

241
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,779
contention which category they are so

242
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,729
there are a lot of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know</font>

243
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:55,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">that could enter into the decision now</font>

244
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:59,300
that so so that will be deliberated soon

245
00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:01,370
thank you at this point we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

255
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:30,020
were foreseeable and that there were

00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,180
there was no<font color="#CCCCCC"> tender no published</font>

257

requirements no estimation of quality

258
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:40,910
and resources weren't given that weren't

259
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:44,150
enough resources given to the process I

260
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:45,350
mean you might have a different you'll

261
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:50,270
probably have a different view on that

262
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:52,940
but could<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with without being a tender</font>

for the application but for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld</font>

264
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,080
application since the tasks for the

whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> process is involved</font>

266
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:03,110
that's correct and then the problems

267
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,069
that came about it could is there

268
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,080
something you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> learnt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from that</font>

269
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:09,620
process or and and now you've got

00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,270
problems with digital archery they could

271
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean could you have better planning</font>

272
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:16,250
processes in place sure the first thing

273
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to say is having been involved in</font>

software development for 30 years

275

hindsight's twenty-twenty no one's made

it credible argument to me that has you

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,370
know any knowledge of the technology and

278
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:31,479
what we're dealing with it this was

279
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:34,940
foreseeable<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the team made</font>

280
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:38,540
absolutely made best efforts to<font color="#E5E5E5"> design a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">thank you rod so it is regrettable that</font>

we had these glitches it's not our

finest moment to go through these things

these incidents and we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

doing a thorough review<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well in our</font>

00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,830
know just make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we put things</font>

294
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:21,650
in perspective whenever you do testing

295
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:23,810
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can envision the problem you can</font>

296
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,550
test<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it if you cannot think of the</font>

297
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,079
test case then it doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

298
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,140
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a lot of testing and you</font>

299
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,330
didn't cover that one test case so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

300
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:36,020
unfortunate that that these things

301
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:40,370
happen and we will place more rigor and

302
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:45,230
more testing on our future products and

303
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:50,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">also make sure that we follow the best</font>

304
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:53,990
as the sdlc rules and processes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

305
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:56,769
you know if I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back in time and say</font>

306
00:14:53,990 --> 00:15:00,220
could we have done<font color="#CCCCCC"> better sure now and</font>

307
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:05,009
in you know hindsight<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course but i</font>

308
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:08,819
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the team did a great job they</font>

309
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:12,639
tested a lot testing is never done so

310
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:14,439
it's it is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is but the important</font>

311
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is that moving forward we're</font>

312
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:19,509
taking these lessons learned and we're

313
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:21,429
implementing them for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future thank</font>

the role of running the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD program</font>

hello yes sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kira McCarthy darling I</font>

320
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,239
have two questions one with regard to

321
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:50,769
that I just know what you say icon

322
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:52,059
doesn't square with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> faculty savored</font>

323
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:54,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">the team did a great job</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't square</font>

324
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:57,850
with the fact that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> fired the new</font>

325
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">gTLD program manager my question I know</font>

326
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,799
and the reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know is that the</font>

327
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:05,589
curb<font color="#E5E5E5"> prince is currently even in his</font>

328
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:08,529
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> job massively overworked so what</font>

329
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:10,449
is the plan to get a new program manager

330
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:12,850
or what is the plan with regard to

331
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:15,549
running this program and keeping the

332
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:17,350
team that was there moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward and</font>

333
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:19,299
in the second question rather than go

334
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:22,600
back for these is more to you stay with

335
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:25,809
regard to the money that that's there on

336
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,339
the excess money that's there how is it

337
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:30,189
ring fenced you say it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ring fence but</font>

338
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:32,230
how is it ring fence can we be certain

339
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:35,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can doesn't have expenses that</font>

340
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:38,290
then dip into that fund and then and

341
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:41,470
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> holding it you're holding it I</font>

342
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:43,419
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a non interest account could</font>

343
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,119
you explain the logic in in that and

344
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:48,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">then also do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have any commitments to</font>

345
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:50,649
we you know you say well we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear</font>

346
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,179
from the community but that could that

347
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:54,790
could hold many many many different

348
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:57,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">options there are any commitments to we</font>

349
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,779
will do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this or we won't do this so that</font>

350
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:02,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">people can feel confident that that</font>

351
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:02,730
money will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be spent wisely</font>

352
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:20,458
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Karen the program director of the of</font>

353
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:23,699
the project design and we are actively

354
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:27,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for a replacement I would say</font>

355
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:30,000
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess three months to six</font>

356
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,620
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because if we find somebody</font>

357
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,830
immediately that is going to be some

358
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,959
time before Kurt can step out of that so

359
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,240
during that time we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

360
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,510
do this we're bringing more people from

361
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">within the organization to help the new</font>

362
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">gTLD program but also assist Curt and</font>

363
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:50,310
his other duties so we're all together

364
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,230
we're all you know we're all a team and

365
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:55,139
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we deliver</font>

366
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:58,500
on all of our initiatives and we will

367
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,300
step you know based on priorities to

368
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:04,890
make sure that the highest<font color="#CCCCCC"> priority</font>

369
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:06,300
programs are in place just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see if you</font>

370
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:12,210
want me I can address a little bit on

371
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:14,520
the money issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then so when we say</font>

372
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:17,730
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ring-fenced the money for the new</font>

373
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">gTLD program is in separate accounts the</font>

374
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:22,290
reason it is in separate accounts is

375
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,420
exactly for that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

376
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:27,330
transparent on what we spend and we're

377
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,970
so that when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you reports on you</font>

378
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:33,540
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spending it would be from these</font>

379
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:37,110
accounts only<font color="#E5E5E5"> for new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld costs that's</font>

380
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,850
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason they are in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> intern</font>

381
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:42,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">an interest-bearing accounts is because</font>

382
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:44,010
the US government gives you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font>

383
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,260
percent insurance for unlimited amounts

384
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:48,180
if you're not earning interest in them

385
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,240
when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are sitting in bank accounts</font>

386
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:54,180
this will end by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the year</font>

387
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's an FDIC insurance in the process</font>

388
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,680
between now and before the end of the

389
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:01,500
year we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the amounts</font>

390
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,470
of money and we're going to classify

391
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,960
them as short-term medium-term

392
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:09,480
longer-term and we're gonna we're going

393
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,490
to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with the BF see what to do</font>

394
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,400
with the medium term and the longer term

395
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,160
so the shorter term there is no need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

396
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,930
go put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a</font>

397
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,340
money you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and some interest bearing</font>

398
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:21,440
account or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that would</font>

399
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,110
rather take the security of the FDIC

400
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,060
insurance on the other two funds we were

401
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:30,320
going to discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the BF see what is</font>

402
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:34,550
the best place to put them but the idea

403
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:37,330
is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that we do the fiduciary</font>

404
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:39,320
responsibility responsible thing for our

405
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:42,350
constituents and the applicants on the

406
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,570
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> monies we have one question</font>

407
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:47,199

entrepreneurs and business people and we

414
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:11,120
have no opinion on it yeah if I might

415
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:13,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kiran after multiple questions and we</font>

416
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">left one part hanging that I want to try</font>

417
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address which is the disposition of</font>

418
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:20,570
the excess funds and how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

419
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,730
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to dip into those for</font>

current operating expenses and so forth

421
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:37,520
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we I have said publicly in the</font>

00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:40,300
past<font color="#E5E5E5"> and reiterated that the surplus</font>

however<font color="#E5E5E5"> much it may be or may not be</font>

424
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:47,530
will simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be used for general</font>

425
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:49,670
operating expenses as one part and also

426
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we will go through a careful</font>

427
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:55,040
process of making a decision about what

428
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:58,820
to do there's any number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of suggestions</font>

429
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:03,379
that have been put forth create a

430
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:07,399
foundation give the money back etc etc

431
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:10,370
etc the commitment that we have so far

432
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,730
is that we have fenced off that money as

433
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:17,360

process to the existing financial

create budgets we review what those

460
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:32,240
increase or decrease over time may have

<font color="#CCCCCC">a significant effect for example trying</font>

462

to be very straightforward so there's no

even more conservative posture that from

494
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:05,010
a business point of view is probably

495
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:07,600
less effective unyielding more

496
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:10,658
protective so that we don't suffer

497
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,668
losses this is in the wake<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the sharp</font>

498

economic downturn where we had to face

00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:18,730
like every organization and debates so

500
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:21,250
we have the the the thought processes

exercising those tools for to implement

the policy that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> just heard Karen</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">let me take one online first this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

from my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Henry who is with computer</font>

or do main domains who are still using

514
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:09,909
but you know the reason for ipv6 is that

515
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,730
we will we are running out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of addresses</font>

of in ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we expect people to start</font>

517
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:22,110
migrating to ipv6 so I hope that answers

518
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:22,110
the question used to want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask one</font>

it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a very important issue</font>

523
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:40,859
though it's still uncertain to me what

524
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:42,119
money can be spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not be spent on</font>

525
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:44,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're talking about the risk element</font>

526
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:47,609
that was written in as a sum<font color="#CCCCCC"> of thirty</font>

527
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:49,229
million that could easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> increase</font>

528
00:25:47,609 --> 00:25:52,678
especially if you get sued which is

00:25:49,229 --> 00:25:54,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">suddenly possible if I can got sued and</font>

you ended up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huge legal bill</font>

could take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that money out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the GTR d</font>

can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do and not do is there anything to</font>

00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:08,969
stop you<font color="#CCCCCC"> from taking money up those</font>

536
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:11,820
accounts of what is the the mechanism by

537
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:13,469
which everyone will be able to see what

538
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,178
is allowable to be taken out there is a

539
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:20,489
council because it's something that will

540
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:21,809
really concern people and then I had a

541
00:26:20,489 --> 00:26:26,849
related question of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that last night you</font>

542
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:29,549
said Steve hang on oh yes oh so and what

543
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:31,139
will be the mechanism by which you would

544
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:32,429
decide to disperse it so you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

545
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:35,968
to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we're going to do this but</font>

546
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:38,129
will it be will you run a PDP you know

547
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:40,469
what I can mechanism will you run or can

548
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:42,119
the board finance committee approve

549
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:43,879
something and then board approves it and

550
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:46,589
then it happens what's going to be the

551
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:51,269
system by which you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to agree</font>

552
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:54,330
how you can spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money so there's a</font>

553
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:56,339
couple of parts there and happy to

554
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:58,259
address the parts as best<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

555
00:26:56,339 --> 00:27:00,749
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we'll probably have gone as far</font>

556
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:02,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">as we can go with this the 30 million</font>

dollars that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> address that you</font>

558
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:10,889

00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:13,369
500 applications we are setting aside on

<font color="#E5E5E5">the basis of that we chose to set aside</font>

00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:19,228
sixty thousand dollars out of every

562

application that money is considerably

563
00:27:19,229 --> 00:27:23,450
now larger than 30 million dollars and

564
00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:29,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">due to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> acknowledge some of the questions</font>

565
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:31,799
that have been raised does the risk rise

00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,469
directly in proportion to the number of

567
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:37,019
applications or it is the risk constant

568
00:27:34,469 --> 00:27:38,609
across any number of applications if you

569

take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the risk as constant across any</font>

you in all cases if you say that the

risk rise is proportionate to the number

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,440
latter approach of setting aside<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60k per</font>

579
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:07,260
application and so the amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

580
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:12,740
set<font color="#CCCCCC"> aside for that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 120 million or</font>

581
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:17,309
some some number in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that range we will</font>

582
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:20,539
evaluate and reassess all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on an</font>

583
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:27,110
ongoing basis and report fully as I said

584
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:30,570
it is the purview of staff to carry out

585
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:31,918
that analysis and to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> reporting</font>

586
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,559
it's the purview of the board finance

587
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,360
committee to oversee that process and

588
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,279
approve the budgets and it's the purview

589
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,990
of course the audit<font color="#CCCCCC"> committee to make</font>

590
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:42,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that the processes are followed</font>

591
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:47,929
internally that that support all of that

592
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:52,379
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that there is a policy</font>

593
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:54,570
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved here the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

594
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:58,279
that is set aside<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover risk is set</font>

595
00:28:54,570 --> 00:29:00,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">aside to cover risks and if there are</font>

596
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:02,250
expenses to be incurred that are

597
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,200
attributable properly attributable to

598
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,990
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD program then that's where the</font>

599
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,960
money comes from and at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> level it's</font>

600
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:11,760
basically one pot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money across all of</font>

601
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:16,139
the expense categories including the

602
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:19,500
surplus and then it's it's a management

603
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:22,830
process within that to report and and

604
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:25,679
control the expenses we've got another

607
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,010
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an elementary issue but as I</font>

608
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,070
can't considered with a possible flood

of new gTLDs a<font color="#E5E5E5"> standardized global</font>

we will get back to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two Jamie on</font>

627
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:49,899
just keep focusing on what needs to be

00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:53,978
done and get it accomplished and no

629
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:55,599
truer words have been spoken so I'm just

630
00:30:53,979 --> 00:31:02,619
going to pass along<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wisdom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

631
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:08,320
advice of Mike Roberts the gentleman

<font color="#E5E5E5">from AFP thank you young polymer FB I'm</font>

634
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,529
the venue for next year's meeting why

00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:22,720
this choice and shall we expect a strong

focus on ID ends<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks sure we have an</font>

open process for selecting the ICANN

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,418
cities in the sense that we request

639
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:34,479
proposals from potential hosts around

640
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:36,190
the world and my vice printers a eunuch

641
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:37,960
of communications Barbara clay can

642
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:40,659
correct me if I'm wrong but I believe we

643
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:44,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">had four proposals how many proposals</font>

644
00:31:40,659 --> 00:31:46,749
this time for Asia meeting for we had

645
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:50,649
four proposals for the Asia meeting of

646
00:31:46,749 --> 00:31:52,419
which China China's was one of the

647
00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:56,320
parties the applet the applicants in

648
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:58,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">China and it simply was a very strong</font>

649
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,580
proposal and clearly the fact that

650
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:02,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">twenty-five percent of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

651
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:06,009
users in the world live in China I think

652
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:09,429
the current estimate is 550 million

653
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:12,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet users in China and growing at a</font>

654
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:14,919
fairly rapid rate it simply makes a lot

655
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:17,498
of sense and particularly being in the

656
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:20,889
capital city that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very significant for</font>

657
00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:23,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">the i kin community and for the chinese</font>

658
00:32:20,889 --> 00:32:25,090
civil society governments and industry

659
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,879
because it gives a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them an</font>

660
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:29,949
opportunity to have access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attend the</font>

661
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:32,109
event and that's that's an advantage of

662
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,509
being in capital cities and as I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

663
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:35,919
before I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I can have a meeting</font>

664
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:38,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">some we've had one in bras</font>

665
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">souls we've had one another capitals I</font>

666
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,280
hope we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I can we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

667
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,620
one in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Washington DC someday just</font>

668
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,990
because it would give a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

669
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:49,149
politicians and government staff members

670
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,860
in the United States firsthand exposure

671
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:54,310
to the multi-stakeholder model at work

672
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:56,979
so we see many benefits of being in

673
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:59,610
China obviously it's a it's a great city

674
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:02,290
there's tremendous culture and heritage

675
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:04,270
it's it's got to be one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most</font>

00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:06,670
exciting<font color="#E5E5E5"> cities in the world with all</font>

00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:08,260
the new technology and buildings and

00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:11,620
development going on there that very

679
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:14,890
much fits with the theme of the internet

680
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:17,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I can so we're really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> excited to be</font>

681
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:20,680
headed there and it also it builds on

682
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:22,689
this growing increasing engagement with

683
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Chinese Internet community that</font>

00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,370
deliberations by staff on this

recommendations to some board committees

690
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:47,709
and then the decision wasn't made and

approved<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the board here unanimously</font>

00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:59,500
and I mean as those<font color="#CCCCCC"> who have watched the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">variants research project variants are</font>

695
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,450
the little differences and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how different</font>

696
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,490
there's different versions of language

697
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:08,560
scripts across the language groups or

698
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:12,340
Geographic borders etc it's a very

699
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:15,370
complex program and and and some of the

700
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:17,620
very excellent research done in the

701
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:20,739
variant study that we kicked off roughly

702
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,900
18 months ago was done in China<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

703
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:25,479
Beijing and there's been an expression

704
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:27,910
of interest by those academic parties to

705
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:30,250
contribute even more going forward and

706
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:33,428
it was also i should note<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">wonderful spirit of collaboration with</font>

710

d-ends will certainly be<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the agenda</font>

like a proposed string you can state

00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:31,690
that if you object or oppose for any

727
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:34,000

729
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,210
hope that parties will do that the the

00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:42,549
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> panel's who will consider the</font>

00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:46,269
objections are independent and their

732
00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:49,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">their world recognized panels and</font>

733
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:50,828
experts in their fields in area and size

734
00:35:49,269 --> 00:35:53,019
doesn't matter I mean they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

735
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:56,410
to consider them they'll they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze</font>

736
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:58,538
the objections on the merits of the

737
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,129
issue now having said size doesn't

738
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:02,200
matter and the issue of community

739
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,970
definition it does so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

740
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,529
community criteria and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those has</font>

741
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:07,990
to do with how well you represent that

742
00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:09,609
community and how engaged are with it so

743
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:11,680
when I said size doesn't matter what I

744
00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:16,029
mean is the size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the party filing the</font>

745
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,710
objection I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe it is going to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">be a key factor unless it should be a</font>

748
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:28,410

you perhaps give us<font color="#E5E5E5"> a timeline for that</font>

00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:56,069
a way

shepherding that through the

organization it's also obviously a

767
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:13,449
multi-party discussion there's I can and

768

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a party in the</font>

769
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:18,609
discussion there's the registrar's

00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:21,039
constituency as a stakeholder in

771
00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:22,359
discussion there's law enforcement mrs.

772
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:25,329
stakeholder in the discussion there's

773
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:28,779
civil society and ultimately they'll be

774
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:30,880
the ICANN board will make<font color="#E5E5E5"> final</font>

00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:33,219
decisions on what we do or what we don't

776
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,009
do I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know discussions are</font>

777
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:38,109
progressing but I'm not prepared to get

778
00:37:36,009 --> 00:37:40,539
into the details at this time of where

779
00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:42,609
it is you ask whether it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

780
00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:45,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">split it out certainly anything's</font>

781
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:48,308
possible but i think the desire of most

782
00:37:45,249 --> 00:37:51,788
the parties at this time is to try to

783
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:54,430
get to a successful conclusion that that

784
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:57,579
enhances the the quality and the

785
00:37:54,430 --> 00:38:00,640
protections under the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raa in a number of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">at what the problems were and how to go</font>

about them well do you have any comments

to make about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are you going</font>

will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be made available to the public</font>

799
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:42,819
like to be transparent so on the digital

800
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:44,440
archery we will of course do the review

801
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:46,359
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we have the</font>

803
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:53,288
see it's part of our transparency the

804
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:58,390
the problems are really issues of

805
00:38:53,289 --> 00:39:00,519
stability of the system we had less than

806

<font color="#E5E5E5">twenty percent of the applicants who</font>

took their aim and their shot on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:11,770
distal archery and we had only less than

you know five or six days<font color="#E5E5E5"> left in the</font>

instability as everybody comes in to

815
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:28,270
finish<font color="#CCCCCC"> their shot so we were instead of</font>

816
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:31,120
keeping it open and getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> results that</font>

817
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:34,930
we're not so confident with we took the

818
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:37,299
option of suspending the program until

819
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:39,910
we also take<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of the</font>

820
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,770
consultations that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on so that</font>

821
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,540
we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a formal opinion and then</font>

822
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:45,490
decide on how to move<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">whether you know we continue the program</font>

824
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:56,680
or go a different route so that's that's

825
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:58,480
the plan right now very<font color="#E5E5E5"> short follow-up</font>

00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:36,070
to through the community develop

policies and with the community

840

around that are completely outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

for other policy decision-making bodies

846
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:57,400
and other governance structures so we

847
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:02,549
don't look at the chosen investments of

848
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,550
parties that's all entirely<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to them</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">thank you Carrie McCarthy again I there</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">don't think was particularly clear and</font>

853
00:41:14,509 --> 00:41:18,170
they were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about getting access</font>

854
00:41:16,009 --> 00:41:20,930
to the TRD root zones there was a

855
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:22,759
project underway at the moment it's very

856
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:24,440
piecemeal and very difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do there</font>

857
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:27,229
was a project underway to make that a

single process that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can would develop</font>

859
00:41:27,229 --> 00:41:31,549
and put across which I actually think

860
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:33,380
will be enormously helpful particularly

861
00:41:31,549 --> 00:41:34,640
with this large number of gTLDs so I

862
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,469
don't know whether you that was clear

863
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,589
but that's how I understood the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

864
00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:46,390
and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big question but my actual</font>

00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:49,279
question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ruth regard to the draa so</font>

866
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:51,680
when he originally started this fast

867
00:41:49,279 --> 00:41:54,469
track<font color="#CCCCCC"> raa negotiations the plan was that</font>

868
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,569
it would be you would have a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> raa for</font>

869
00:41:54,469 --> 00:41:58,489
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Costa Rica meeting which was a few</font>

870
00:41:56,569 --> 00:42:00,170
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and then that didn't happen</font>

871
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:02,509
for whatever reason and I remember

872
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:03,979
asking the question a Costa Rican you

873
00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:05,719
say well we're fairly confident<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

874
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:07,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">have it done by the next meeting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font>

875
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:10,309
said well what happens if you haven't

876
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:13,879
and I think used to you say well I don't

877
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:16,729
know we'll see so we're here again and

878
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is again what happens if</font>

879
00:42:16,729 --> 00:42:21,198
it's not done by the next meeting can

880
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,549
this go on indefinitely what's the point

881
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:26,869
where you break this ongoing cycle also

882
00:42:24,549 --> 00:42:29,479
from what I'm hearing from the

883
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:32,900
registrar's what they say their concern

884
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:35,808
is that I can is being very stubborn and

885
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:38,029
saying it's all or nothing you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to</font>

886
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:40,279
take everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> we put down or nothing</font>

887
00:42:38,029 --> 00:42:41,839
at all and that's where the sticking

888
00:42:40,279 --> 00:42:44,569
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't this and what some of these</font>

889
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:46,819
are not reasonable and that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

890
00:42:44,569 --> 00:42:50,229
understand the negotiations are breaking

891
00:42:46,819 --> 00:42:50,229
down so any comment you have on that

892
00:42:54,070 --> 00:43:03,010
certainly after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the car when there was</font>

893
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:06,370
quite direct input from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gac to the</font>

894
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:07,690
board about how long the negotiations

895
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:09,549
have been going on in the lack of

896
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:13,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">progress with respect to addressing law</font>

897
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:18,340
enforcement concerns the board was

898
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:22,510
strongly concerned about this and

899
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:25,180
focused attention and asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

900
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:27,610
progress as rapidly as possible your

901
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:29,319
recitation of the sequences essentially

902
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:31,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">write that there was an expectation be</font>

903
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:37,210
done by Costa Rica and didn't get

904
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:43,180
completed and now here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we at the board</font>

905
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:49,500
level in a short while not not not today

906
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:51,970
but sort of probably in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few weeks when</font>

907
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:54,130
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are settled down after this</font>

908
00:43:51,970 --> 00:44:00,669
meeting and<font color="#CCCCCC"> akram is fully in place</font>

909
00:43:54,130 --> 00:44:05,020
we'll ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a clearer picture of where</font>

910
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:09,550
things stand it's a complicated business

911
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:12,670
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> in broad terms law enforcement</font>

912
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:18,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">wants a whole set of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that they</font>

00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:21,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">think are helpful to their cause there's</font>

914
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:23,350
22 contrary forces one from civil

915
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,720
society that worries about whether law

916
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:29,020
enforcement goes too far and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

917
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:31,180
the registrar's from at least a business

918
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:33,009
perspective if not a values perspective

919
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,560
of saying well these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are</font>

920
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:40,180
expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and would materially change</font>

921
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:44,259
the business what has to happen whether

922
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:46,120
it's sooner or later is the supporting

923
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,670
information has to come to the surface

924
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:50,799
how effective are these measures with

925
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:53,770
respect to what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they're trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

926
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:57,310
accomplish<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how expensive are they in</font>

927
00:44:53,770 --> 00:45:00,220
fact and so forth so I I would like to

928
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:01,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">see I'll just speak for myself I would</font>

929
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,980
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see both the register our</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">community and the law enforcement</font>

requests

933
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:14,910
or their postures are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but also a</font>

934
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:18,520
much richer base of information so that

00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:21,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have the to use the current lingo</font>

937
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:28,029
evidence-based policies I have the

pleasure of meeting with the law

enforcement continue those here that's

940
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:35,370
here last evening<font color="#E5E5E5"> and had this</font>

941
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:37,690
conversation with them I've had

942
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:39,549
occasional conversations with some of

943
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:40,930
the registrar's and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want</font>

944
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the all those</font>

945
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:45,430
negotiations this is sort of a posture

946
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:48,370
of we really there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are real problems</font>

947
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:49,870
that have to be addressed and legitimate

948
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:52,210
conversations that have to take place

949
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:55,450
and let's bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's let's get to it</font>

950
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:57,850
and some of these we can do in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> short</font>

951
00:45:55,450 --> 00:46:01,600
run and some of them will take longer

952
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:04,200
time as we bring the research and an

953
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,220
evidence gathering into the process

954
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,020
we've got time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for one more question</font>

955
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:14,259
then we got to get these guys out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

956
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:16,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">here last question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no Oh Monica we had</font>

957
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:19,120
to twist your arm how unusual<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monica</font>

958
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,540
wants to ask a question one question

959
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:26,290
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the to the let's say general</font>

960
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:30,040
technical excellence that was then the

961
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:31,810
incoming CEO spoke about this how from

962
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,940
from the experience that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

963
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:37,950
gathered is there anything that you

964
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:43,030
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say can help you let's say don't</font>

965
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:45,850
give all this this software work to the

966
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:48,240
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the don't outsource it do it do</font>

967
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:52,600
more yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> or are there any any</font>

968
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:57,129
lessons that you would say you took from

969
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:59,950
there so definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a lot of</font>

970
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:02,200
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can put in place and</font>

971
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:04,810
improvements from the learnings when you

972
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:07,629
look back and say okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what</font>

973
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:09,220
were the decisions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were made one of</font>

974
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:14,800
the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> things on the program is that</font>

975
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:17,370
it was a long program that was starting

976
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,380
when the expectations were much smaller

977
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:23,019
so originally I think the

978
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:24,490
when they decided on the course of the

979
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:27,788
software development we're considering

980
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:30,399
300 applications so you start there and

981
00:47:27,789 --> 00:47:31,990
then things take a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you end</font>

982
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,460
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a different kind of program and</font>

983
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:35,799
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issues</font>

984
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:38,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">that led to this but definitely there</font>

985
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:41,170
are certain things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can do and put in</font>

986
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:44,288
place and to improve where we are

987
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:46,660
specially looking at the future from

988
00:47:44,289 --> 00:47:50,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">today instead of from three or four</font>

989
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:54,220
years ago so we are doing some reviews

990
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:56,680
we are looking at assessing how we do

991
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:58,118
things and as we do all of this we're

992
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,690
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put in place a better structure</font>

993
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:06,400
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward to get more quality and</font>

994
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:09,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">then more rigorous rigor in the way we</font>

995
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,759
release code and we get things<font color="#E5E5E5"> done so</font>

996
00:48:09,309 --> 00:48:11,759
definitely
