transparency continued to be all

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,269
important for us and I have added

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,000
accountable we are and toward this end

29
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,850
let me briefly mention several of the

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,320
activities that I said are in progress

31
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,880
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are evolving the schedule of our</font>

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,798

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,579
poorly attended and as you've heard

37
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,710
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> cancelled them but we still get</font>

38
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,649
our work done but more to the point they

39
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,979
didn't provide any real interaction with

40
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,320
the board and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the resolutions as they</font>

41

should have been and were were

42
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,729
determined well in advance that's the

43
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,119
proper way for<font color="#CCCCCC"> board meetings to operate</font>

44
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,460
we will have public board meetings when

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,600
there are very important or

46
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:59,280
controversial matters on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the agenda the</font>

56
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,870
continuously throughout the year

telephonic board meetings face to face
