00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:09,330
all of you when I first addressed this

group in sydney in 2009 when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

appointed you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember the two</font>

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,920
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i spoke about in that</font>

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:21,960
acceptance speech<font color="#E5E5E5"> i talked about two</font>

things cacophony and symphony and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,710
that when you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the all the</font>

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,480
activity of the i kin community within

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,330
the individual stakeholder groups or

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,820
across them you see tremendous amounts

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,730
of activity and documents and comments

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,680
and replies and edits and negotiations

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,680
and debates that some even call

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,070
perpetual debates and you can hear a lot

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">of noise but if you rise above that and</font>

17
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:51,360
look at what comes out of that rich

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,989
process of so many parties sharing their

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,360
views you might also hear a symphony and

20
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think in the last three years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,100
really made some pretty good music

22
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">together maybe it hasn't been a symphony</font>

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,409
but at a minimum it's been some really

24
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,990
good jazz and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our Wednesday</font>

27
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,740
it's been an exciting process in an

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,060
exciting time in an exciting<font color="#CCCCCC"> road and</font>

29
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:25,770
you know how do we describe to the world

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:29,250
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do one of my favorite magazines</font>

31
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,399
has got to be that magnificent UK piece

32
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,759
that's so clever so witty and often with

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,400
such wonderful cover pages called The

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,619
Economist and what is the Economist call

35

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's cute I think that's that's clever</font>

38
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:55,170
with the the traditional flippant of the

39

economist but it is hard to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

40
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,210
can from the outside but inside there's

41
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,390
just tremendous richness and what I'd

42
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:07,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what I've</font>

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,379
came here

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,959
to help transform this organization and

48
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:21,328
working together I think we scored some

49
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,680
very significant accomplishments<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

50
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:24,959
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd like to look at three</font>

51
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,810
areas look at how we overhauled the

52
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,799
organization secondly how we opened<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,530
and transform the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns and thirdly how we</font>

00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:37,349
further internationalize the

tirelessly to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build i can from nothing</font>

61
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:56,579
from zero in 1998 to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i inherited</font>

62
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,340
but it was an organization that was very

63
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:01,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">much strained at its size and it had</font>

64
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,780
grown so quickly that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't</font>

65
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,120
always clear lines of separation in

66
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,150
terms of the role of board staff and

67
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,799
community because they're almost are no

68
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,750
lines in many cases in the policy-making

69
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:14,609
process when there's so much debate and

70
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,030
dialogue and editing and reversion going

71
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:20,370
on and that's fine but when it comes to

72
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,650
execution operations there have to be

73
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,919
clear lines think alone of the

74
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,949
compliance function the ICANN staff has

75
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,500
to implement compliance compliance is

76
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:34,019
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a popularity contest okay and it's</font>

77
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,329
not an open process the<font color="#E5E5E5"> definition of</font>

78
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:39,329
the policies is but not the execution so

79
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:42,239
what we focused on in many<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases was</font>

80
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,519
clarifying roles and there was a word

81
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,530
that had to be used quite frequently and

82
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,079
that word was and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mention it to the</font>

83
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,500
board when the board brought me on was

84
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,150
the word no<font color="#CCCCCC"> no we can't do that and</font>

85
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,069
everything else we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

86
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,949
trade off we either stick with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> plans</font>

87
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,659
and hold the line or we change the plans

88
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:03,810
but then we extend our time frames

89
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:07,500
single character you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds is as one</font>

90
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,060
of hundreds of examples so there was a

91
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,919
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of changes in how weary on the</font>

simply to drive things forward and to

internationalized domain names

150
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,270
and together we've done that and in

151
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,409
doing so we've enhanced the unity of the

152

<font color="#E5E5E5">domain name system and the internet and</font>

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:53,389
then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the next year we added</font>

and so many others had helped<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop</font>

157
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:03,590
that was important for adding security a

161
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,590
the checks are doing an excellent job of

implementing the DNS SEC<font color="#CCCCCC"> routed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

164
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,500
and now we're all working on its

165
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:22,310
adoption that was another big move<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

166
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:26,210
then finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the effort that so many of</font>

you have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on for up to seven</font>

172
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,669
history and I remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I first came</font>

173
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:43,009
to I<font color="#E5E5E5"> came my first meeting in Seoul I</font>

174
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:47,150
was on an escalator with one of the

175

leaders of the gns oh and he asked me he

179
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:58,550
answer was you bet you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the right man</font>

180
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,198
i said i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't i don't care what it's</font>

184
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:11,000
results and we will get it done doesn't

185
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">matter how long it takes we're gonna lay</font>

186
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,250
it down we'll do a project plan which we

187
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:18,169
did and which we stuck to and delivered

188
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:23,539
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exciting reveal that just</font>

189
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:27,650
happened on june the 13th with 1930

190
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:30,380
names included what<font color="#E5E5E5"> remarkable progress</font>

at<font color="#E5E5E5"> ID ends you look at DNS SEC you look</font>

193
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,700
at this new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld program we have</font>

194
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,919
fundamentally opened up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> transformed</font>

195
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,630
the domain name system these last three

196
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,968
years through your incredible efforts

197
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,459
through staffs incredibly hard efforts

198
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:50,630
through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> boards incredibly great</font>

199
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:53,089
efforts so it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of change the</font>

200
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,559
third<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that we can look at</font>

201
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,999
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> excited about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

202
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,120
further internationalization of the

203
00:08:55,999 --> 00:09:00,790
organization now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always been</font>

204
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,379
international but it continues to grow

205
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,509
and become more international and to me

206
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:07,790
that was critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> I felt when I came in</font>

207
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:11,449
that this organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to Western</font>

208
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:14,120
focused too focused on issues in North

209
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:15,579
America and Europe for example and it

210
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,550
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider the rest of the world</font>

211
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:22,550
today half of the users of the internet

212
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,709
or in Asia alone and there's many in

213
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:28,939
Africa and Latin America as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

214
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:31,878
it's important that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we focus on that so</font>

215
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:33,589
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did we do well my first day on the</font>

216
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:37,100
job I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> given a blank sheet of paper</font>

217
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:38,540
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was told that the memorandum of</font>

218
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,519

going to be renewed by i can and i was

221
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:48,290
told you better come up with something

222
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:52,420
better and you have to get it done<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 90</font>

223
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:55,189
days because the MOU is going to expire

224
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,349
together we worked and we created<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

225
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:59,839
affirmation of commitments the

226
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:02,660
affirmation which makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can so much</font>

227
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,809
more international constitutionally or

228
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,730
contractually with what we have and look

229
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:09,949
at the great work of the three review

230
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,290
teams that have already<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished or</font>

231
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:15,290
nearly finished their work the ATR

232
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,509
t-team the who is team the security and

233
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:20,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">stability resilience team these teams</font>

234
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:23,379
are international with people from the

235
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:27,529
private sector from government from

236
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:29,059
civil society from all over the world so

237
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:30,170
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> internationalize i can with the</font>

238
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:32,350
affirmation of commitments very

239
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,759
fundamentally and you have executed

240
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,740
secondly you look at the staff when I

241
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,959
came in many people didn't understand

242
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,209
when I said I want every employee every

243
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:45,679
new person we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had in staff should be</font>

244
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:47,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi lingual fluent multilingual fluent</font>

245
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,800
I don't care where in the world they're

246
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:50,540
from but they need to be multilingual

247
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,248
fluent people say why why does that

248
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,050
matter for someone who's just in the

249
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:55,550
technical shop why does that matter for

250
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,199
someone who's a receptionist why does

251
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know sure that makes sense in</font>

252
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:01,579
the field organization or somewhere else

253
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its cultural we need to be of</font>

254
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:06,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">the world we need to reflect the world</font>

255
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:08,649
we have to do it with our people

256
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:11,290
approximately seventy-five percent of

257
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:14,829
every staff member we've hired since I

258
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:16,959
came is multilingual fluent and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

259
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:18,969
shifted the culture of I can internally

260
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,069
and when you walk down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the halls even in</font>

261
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,680
Los Angeles you're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely to hear</font>

262
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:26,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tagalog spoken or Spanish or French or</font>

263
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,910
any number of languages and that's an

264
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:31,269
important step on the executive

265
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:33,160
management team when I came there was

266
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:36,339
one or two instances of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> florent</font>

267
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:40,230
foreign language fluency on the entire

executive team today<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are 99</font>

269
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,220
instances of foreign language fluency

270
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:46,930
and quite a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that were</font>

271
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,819
born<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the non english speaking world</font>

272
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,800
that's important that international

<font color="#CCCCCC">eise's us helps us understand the views</font>

379
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,470

enormous amounts of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 500</font>

435
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:55,169
gigabytes of data to<font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out who had</font>

436
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:56,639
seen what<font color="#CCCCCC"> when and then once we figured</font>

437
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:58,350
all that out of course as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font>

438
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:00,479
shared<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with you the applicants</font>

439
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:02,908
because that was our job was to focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

440
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,859
the applicants share with the world what

441
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:07,440
was going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> but focus on the applicants</font>

442
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:08,879
but it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most exhausting</font>

443
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,009
management processes I've ever been

444
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:12,359
through and for the organization we

445
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:15,539
learned a lot of skills on it we had a

446
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:17,489
lot of expertise we hired a nationally

447
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:19,320
and internationally respected crisis

448
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,149
management leaders part of the team we

449
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,889
hired world-class communication experts

450
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:24,479
as part of the team and those cryptic

451
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:26,998
little messages that you'd see coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

452
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,279
every day you can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine how</font>

453
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,869
many hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> were put into those documents</font>

454
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,639
in those statements to make sure they

455
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:35,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">were precisely accurate and appropriate</font>

456
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:38,129
and but we work through it these things

457
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:41,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">will happen in any organization and a</font>

458
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:45,509
growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization we work through it</font>

459
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:46,859
so that's the summary I think those are

460
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:50,519
the three areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we really made</font>

461
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:52,350
progress again and I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk now</font>

462
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:53,909
about where we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's talk</font>

463
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,279
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's going to be taking the reins</font>

464
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:58,830
here and so first I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,399

467
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,700

receives and its leadership receives

516
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,950
because it's one of the most open

transparent and debated policy groups
