00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,520
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only been a few hours since the</font>

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:06,080
ICANN board meeting finished here in

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,490
Singapore and I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank both you</font>

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,969
gentlemen for taking the time to talk to

5
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:13,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">us Steve Crocker thank you very much</font>

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:16,880
newly elected<font color="#CCCCCC"> Board Chair rod Beckstrom</font>

7
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:19,580
president CEO Steve let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with you</font>

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,710
with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> appointment as the new chair</font>

9
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,799
and with a stork passage of the new

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:27,320
gTLDs what sort of new challenges<font color="#CCCCCC"> lie</font>

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,650
ahead for you this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very big</font>

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,780
operation and so I'm now in the

13
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,900
uncomfortable position of trying to sit

14
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,970
astride and hang<font color="#E5E5E5"> on for dear life as it</font>

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,010
work

16
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:44,129
the challenge the real challenges for

17
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:47,910
the organization as a whole to<font color="#E5E5E5"> execute</font>

18
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,200
moving this<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD program forward as well</font>

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,529
as carrying on the regular day-to-day

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,690
business that it's already has to do and

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,660
the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> and commitment so</font>

22
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:01,170
there's a kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> triple and there</font>

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,900
will be both resource and execution

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,470
challenges for the well-defined parts of

25
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:10,530
the program<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there will be</font>

26
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:12,000
anticipated problems or oddball cases or

27
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,970
loose ends that have to be dealt with

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,470
and so it will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a certain amount of of</font>

29
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,000
refinement that will be opposed to us

30
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,970
while we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get on with the</font>

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,040
main work I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing you say that the</font>

32
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,580
board's work with new gTLDs is not

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,270
finished well in the main you know we've

34
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,460
set the course but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

35
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too big a deal of it but</font>

36
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,149
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always something that's going to</font>

37
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,220
come up with you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

38
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,680
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sleep and say you know we're done</font>

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,530
it's all over with

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,510
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be pretty embroiled</font>

41
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,340
continuing basis rod we've entered a new

42
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:49,460
phase with the board's approval of the

43
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:52,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">gTLD program the implementation phase</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

44
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,220
I can ready sure yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> we built an</font>

45
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,870
excellent executive management team

46
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,910
we've been preparing for this moment for

47
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,619
years as an organization certainly all

48
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,520
two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> since I've been here the</font>

49
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:03,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">program's already been in our</font>

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,009
development so the software systems

51
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:09,258
management teams still a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work to</font>

52
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,150
do and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a type schedule we</font>

53
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:12,769
have additional things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we later on</font>

54
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,110
this week such as support for needy

55
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,730
applicants from developing<font color="#CCCCCC"> countries the</font>

56
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,530
staff will need to support the process

57
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,988
<font color="#CCCCCC">that community</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the board resolving that</font>

58
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,880
quickly and implementing that but yes

59
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:24,920
where we are ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move ahead with</font>

60
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,900
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> program as long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as we keep it as</font>

61
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,910
we've defined it and don't start

62
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">changing and expanding the scope are you</font>

63
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,630
concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that sure the natural</font>

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,690
pressure from this community is always

65
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,209
to iterate and change and refine and so

66
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:42,230
we're going to resist<font color="#E5E5E5"> that temptation</font>

67
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:44,239
while we execute the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> round is that</font>

68
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,310
or is something else your single

69
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,890
greatest fear in terms of implementing

70
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,310
properly the new program yes it actually

71
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,170
is my greatest very scope creep of

72
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,450
changing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> spec or the pressure to add</font>

73
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,339
new things in I think you know we can

74
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">handle what was approved by the board on</font>

75
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,450
Monday we can we can handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

76
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,279
something for many applicants in

77
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,679
developing countries if the board and

78
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,010
community come up with very clear

79
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,170
directions by Dakar at the latest and

80
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,120
then allow us to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and execute but if</font>

81
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:16,429
there's all kinds of other deliberations

82
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,010
that come in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> lobbying to change</font>

83
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,959
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it would put pressure on the</font>

84
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,790
date not on the program so much but on

85
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the date of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the launch that is currently</font>

86
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,048
scheduled for January to

87
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,150
and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're committed to so</font>

88
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:30,190
you want a clear roadmap yes and the

89
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,989
clear roadmap comes from sticking with

90
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,190
the plans that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> approved the</font>

91
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:34,840
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> has already been worked on</font>

92
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,940
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be lots of other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great ideas</font>

93
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the future let's consider those for</font>

94
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,440
subsequent rounds all the focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on execution and as Steve</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">said on resolving any issues that relate</font>

97

<font color="#CCCCCC">to the framework</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's already approved</font>

98
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,670
as we go through the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of details</font>

99
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,739
and steps on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many applications do</font>

100
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,559
you expect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> receive if you're looking</font>

101
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:58,510
ahead when the application process opens

102
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,250
our January 12 yeah we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't</font>

103
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,620
speculate like that and as we've stated

104
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,750
there's some websites out there that<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

105
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,459
there's 90 you know applicants that

106
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,870
seemed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to self-identify and maybe</font>

107
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:10,569
there's a hundred and twenty candidates

108
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:14,200
but we don't tally we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do that our</font>

109
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:16,060
job is to be prepared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to handle the</font>

110
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,039
applications in an orderly and

111
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,478
professional fashion to protect the

112
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:21,909
security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stability of the root of</font>

113
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:25,419
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet steve has the relationship</font>

114
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:27,520
between the ICANN board and the GAC been

115
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:30,639
redefined by the dialogue and debate

116
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,870
that occurred over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD issue I</font>

117
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,210
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say it's certainly gotten improved</font>

118
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:40,710
and it's gotten deeper in the sense that

119
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:45,190
this has provided a very hefty

120
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:46,630
substantive opportunities and experience

121
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:50,440
interacting back and forth with each

122
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:54,659
other and I been able to experience

123
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:57,430
firsthand that the relationships are

124
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:02,590
broader and deeper assistant and that

125
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:05,200
there will be easier communication and

126
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:09,219
earlier involvement in whatever process

127
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:12,280
has come up so it's been a pretty

128
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,100
positive and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it pretty exciting</font>

129
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,659
i'm actually in the past the

130
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,470
relationship with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gac has been gonna</font>

131
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:27,310
kind of isolated and speaking personally

132
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:31,120
I feel a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot closer and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more it's</font>

133
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:33,940
more immediate you know like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> consents</font>

134
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,620
it let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me spin off of that when I talked</font>

135
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,560
to your predecessor<font color="#E5E5E5"> Peter dang gate</font>

136
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,000
thrush and I asked him what single bit

137
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,090
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> advice he would have for you it could</font>

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,010
basically be summed up in two words

139
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,270
flexibility and listening would you

140
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">agree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with Peter in terms of the</font>

141
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:52,650
importance of those two qualities well

142
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:55,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolutely I would start with listening</font>

143
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:59,489
first and foremost flexibility always

144
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:03,250
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would add a third which is</font>

145
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,990
follow through execution it's fine to

to listen and it's important to have

148
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,260
some flexibility and it's also very

149
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:14,230
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to follow through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

comes from getting things done and from

152
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:23,680
success rather than just a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

153

and posturing rod just spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

importance of clarity about the

of understanding of those elements<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

that of equal concern for you it

certainly is and the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:45,640
petitioning people come at us from

161
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,740
individually that come out as part of

162
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,659
organizations they come out us through

the supporting organizations advisory

committees and the board is obligated

165
00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:00,969
and as a very important role to listen

166
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:04,300
as you said end to to be respectful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

cause fracturing and unraveling

00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,300
everything so a certain degree of

firmness of support for the decisions

172
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:21,100
that are made and a quickening of the

pulse at the end and exert ooh get there

174

as opposed to so the time for endless

00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,810
suggest there's more blocking that's

193

you know some level of blocking and that

197
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:24,520

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,810
then and in fact I'm kind of surprised

202
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,669
after

203

arranged a communications plan to go

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,479
around all five regions of the world and

237
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,819
communicate and it started on Monday<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

238
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,060
twentieth and it's certainly started

00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,490
with a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of attention to the interest</font>

240
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,560
I mean a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of interest on the issue</font>

241
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,950
there seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a great deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

242
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,560
confusion among<font color="#CCCCCC"> the public between the</font>

243
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:07,870
generic top-level domain and those who

244
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,920
want a second-level domain can basically

245
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:14,260
very late terms explain the difference

246
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,189
second-level domains under any of the

247
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,290
major top-level domain so

248
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,390
widely and easily available in a very

249
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:24,199
little cost and with very very little

250
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:26,270
control so for you know in a few minutes

251
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,680
and for a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars you can apply for</font>

252
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:32,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">something the top-level domains and the</font>

253
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,859
ones that go into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> room have been</font>

00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:40,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">treated as very very careful resources</font>

256
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:47,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">way there's there's no concern globally</font>

257
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,940
in the community if somebody has a

258
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,100
second-level domain and it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it stops</font>

259
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,890
working that's their problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

260
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">enormous concern if a top-level domain</font>

261
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:58,670
stops working and and under it all of

262
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,100
the second-level domains that are

263
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:03,770
registered<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it might stop working so</font>

264
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,260
from a from a stability point of view

265
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:09,079
security point of view that's certainly

266
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,260
one of the major concerns and on the

267
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:15,650
basis of that part of the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

268
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:18,050
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost in fact is to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

269
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:20,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the applicants are ready to run a</font>

00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,160
first-class top-level domain have the

271
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,760
resources they have a technical talent

272
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,750
that they organized and so forth and so

273
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:32,210
that's one major aspect of all that

274
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:35,450
another major aspect is that top-level

275
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:38,300
domains are viewed as having quite a bit

276
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:41,270
of the global visibility which perfectly

277
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:44,079
appropriate and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that brings all of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> political and business forces of</font>

279
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,880
trademarks and whether the names have

280
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,920
any kind of meaning and whether

281
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,980
emotional content associated with that

282
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:58,240
sort so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that and</font>

even just in more direct<font color="#E5E5E5"> stability and</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> desire to not have things that look</font>

00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,720
technical response<font color="#CCCCCC"> would say what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

291
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,700
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> in top level second</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> level we</font>

292
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,240
feel the mechanics are about the same

293
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:27,040
but there's this enormous difference in

294
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,870
the perceptions and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> treatment and</font>

295
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,430
expectations that just leads to

296
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,380
qualitatively different operation great

297
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,000
and let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> just add you know any</font>

298
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,380
consumer or small business or

299
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,510
organization can do a second-level

300
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,830
domain name registration that's easy

301
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,439
you've got a little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money you go</font>

302
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:44,380
online use your credit card but the new

303
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,600
gTLDs are not for consumers I mean you

304
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,670
have to have very serious technical what

305
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,910
we call registry operations and you have

306
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:53,800
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a ongoing business to to commit to</font>

307
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,439
this it's a significant commitment of

308
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,839
time people and resources Steve even had

309
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:02,380
an amazing career you're considered one

310
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,660
of the architects of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

311
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:08,140
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you place being elected as I can</font>

312
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:11,230
board share in terms of those life

313
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,810
experiences well you know it's you know

314
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:16,600
what do you do after you've become

315
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:19,530
useless as technical person latest

316
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:25,300
elevate youth of the front office right

317
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:29,160
so no it's a kidding aside this is this

318
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:33,620
is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a joy in the sense that</font>

319
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,569
it's been a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long ride</font>

320
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,670
look back over more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than 40 years from</font>

321
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,800
the time we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first node on the</font>

322
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:42,890
ARPANET and then all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> developments</font>

323
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,979
and each one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stages looks like it</font>

324
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:48,920
was huge compared to what came before

325
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:51,260
and so there's that wealth of seeing

326
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,870
that arc of events and knowing a lot of

327
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,339
the people and knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vast numbers</font>

328
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,950
of people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been positively</font>

329
00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:00,370
affected by all of these developments<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

330
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:02,630
it's a it's quite exciting actually

331
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">right let me pose the same question to</font>

332
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:08,089
you you're well aware of Steve's

333
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:11,300
background is it the the combination of

334
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:12,800
his experience that will take the board

335
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,569
in a new direction or is there single

336
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">quality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you see that will vastly</font>

337
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,130
benefit him being the new chair sure

338
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,990
well look I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the one thing it's a</font>

339
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,730
great transition at this time to occur I

340
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,460
mean if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last couple</font>

341
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:28,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">years since I came here enormous policy</font>

342
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:29,990
development work to be done on new gTLDs

343
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,700
a lot of intellectual property<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues</font>

344
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,560
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous chairman was a</font>

345
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,120
world-class expert in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that topic if you</font>

346
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at where we're going now as we</font>

347
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussed the draft applicant guidebook</font>

348
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,600
is approved now we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

349
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:44,209
implemented but maintain the security

350
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,040
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stability of the internet and you</font>

351
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:48,290
know Steve's a world-class expert in

352
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and with his wealth of knowledge on</font>

353
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:52,400
that side I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

354
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:54,739
good really good teaming my<font color="#E5E5E5"> strength is</font>

355
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,420
on leadership side and execution and

356
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,910
he's got the tremendous you know

357
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,680
technology and security background so I

358
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,600
would just think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a pretty good</font>

359
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">match for where we're headed gentlemen</font>

360
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">thank you very much thank you thank you</font>
