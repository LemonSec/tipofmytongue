00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:27,119
can and I can in one of its many roles

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:29,490
is task what's ensuring the security

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:34,710
stability and reliability of the

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:38,399
Internet's unique identifiers and so as

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:41,969
part of that I cans been very involved

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,520
in the policies and the deployment of

15
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:48,030
DNS<font color="#E5E5E5"> second the root zone and we</font>

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,850
encourage other gTLDs and ccTLDs to

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,910
deploy DNS SEC as soon as technically

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,980
possible because we believe DNS SEC is

19
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:00,328
very important in enabling either both

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,459
future innovation and enhancing the

21
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:07,110
overall security of the domain name

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,189
system and and as part of that basically

23
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,270
at the beginning of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year we had</font>

24
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:14,100
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero zone signed just last week</font>

25
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">last month we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had about 70 s own signed</font>

26
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:21,330
and just on Monday<font color="#CCCCCC"> the twentieth through</font>

27
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,420
the work of packet clearinghouse of 14

28
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,450
more ccTLDs were signed raising<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

29
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,890
total number<font color="#CCCCCC"> two over 85 and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we stick</font>

30
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,390
with this trend we're hoping by the end

31
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,030
of the year<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have the vast majority</font>

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,890
of all zone signed which would be a

33
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,420
fantastic achievement to think that

34
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,180
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone from basically zero to almost</font>

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:43,680
one hundred percent in one year once DNS

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:46,320
SEC was adoption began so I would like

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,420
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> congratulate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bill Woodcock</font>

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,758
and the packet clearinghouse for signing

39
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,189
these 14 new zones and I think it's a

40
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,380
very positive achievement and it's one

41
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,240
that I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> to beacon gradually</font>

42
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,560
congratulating others on in the months

43
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,270
ahead so with that I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">bill the research director for the</font>

46
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,319
clearing house is a not-for-profit

47
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,270
organization that has focused on

48
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,649
building secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet infrastructure</font>

49
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,939
for

50
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:21,150
the past 18 years we have built more

51
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:24,390
than 100 internet exchange points and we

52
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:27,180
host more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than 80 top-level domains</font>

53
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:31,339
right now on our global DNS

54
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:34,040
infrastructure so when rod Beckstrom

55
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,799
asked us about the feasibility of

56
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,078
building out<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS SEC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infrastructure on</font>

57
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:42,569
top of that last year it seemed a very

58
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:46,799
natural fit for our mission and our

59
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:48,268
staff and capabilities so we as well as

60
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,670
a number of other organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

61
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:56,489
been building infrastructure to do this

62
00:02:50,670 --> 00:03:00,828
ours is interesting in in several ways

63
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:03,510
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all its operational and</font>

64
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:05,790
providing services<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now secondly</font>

65
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,480
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nonprofit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nature it is</font>

66
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:12,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">done at no cost and it is done openly in</font>

67
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,369
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense of open source and Creative</font>

68
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,349
Commons licensing on all the

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,109
documentation and legal work that's

70
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:20,730
being done so our goal is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much</font>

71
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:23,430
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sign a bunch of top-level</font>

72
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,010

73
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,720
allow top-level domains to sign

74
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,168
themselves to operate their own

75
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,209
infrastructure and so forth so we just

76
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:35,940
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this happen we don't try to</font>

77
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,790
control the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the work</font>

78
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:43,519
that's being done is open for anyone to

take use emulate however they wish to so

80
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:50,629
very specifically what we are doing is

81
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:53,400
we're building three<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical security</font>

87
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,418
approximately the same physical security

88
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,909
we are using the same procedural

89
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:16,769
security we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> following the same</font>

00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:21,418
standards that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route does in the I</font>

91
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:24,800
can process of signing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route so the</font>

92
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:27,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">point behind that is that auditors</font>

93
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,100
basically have to be satisfied<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

94
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,300
the route is signed because the route

95
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,670
isn't going to be signed different ways

96
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,560
for different people if we use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

97
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,820
processes and procedures as the route

98
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,680
then the auditors can be assured that

99
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,150
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to compare apples and</font>

100
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,340
oranges they don't have to look at

101
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:49,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">different standards they know that the</font>

102
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:52,940
the route signing process and the TLD

103
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:55,200

104
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,969
significant change between the way the

105
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,280
rudest on and the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is done is</font>

106
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the route is signed in two locations in</font>

107
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,359

a non-profit entity so it's ro basically

214
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:55,120
is to do the management of an

proceeded with or continued with its

tanzanians in the cyberspace so the

239
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:20,370
center has just finalized its first-ever

240
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:24,150
strategic plan which is due to start to

241
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:29,250
infest<font color="#E5E5E5"> de july this year now and in</font>

which DN<font color="#E5E5E5"> sec has been given a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a priority</font>

243
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:35,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">on its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implementation so the strategic</font>

244
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:38,970
plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is of this kind and it will be</font>

245
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:42,000
operational on festy july so perhaps

246
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:44,850
recording from the original design of

247
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,070
the internet as we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know originally</font>

248
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,860
the internet was designed without might

249
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:52,860
security considerations and instead it

250
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">was designed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a scalable disputed</font>

251
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,870
system so the design has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

252
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,810
successfully operational we don't

253
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:04,050
complain about that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> until recently</font>

254
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:07,109
when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS related vulnerabilities</font>

255
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:11,030
were detected and<font color="#E5E5E5"> exploited to some to</font>

256
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:16,710
somehow this venerable when averages has

257
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:20,220
forced the innovators<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about</font>

258
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:21,610
security so the that's why the current

<font color="#CCCCCC">grove agenda</font>

260
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:27,430
has been for sister DS the main aims to

261
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:32,040
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> security on the internet need to be</font>

262
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:36,670
or to implement a DNA chain trust

263
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:40,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">platforms and of course because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of dirty</font>

264
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:43,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">set is among the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS hyrek it will never</font>

265
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:46,149
be accepted from that so coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

266
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:49,450
relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> between it is Enoch and a</font>

267
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:52,450
PCH what I should say about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is that</font>

268
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:55,540
time there is a service<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anycast the</font>

269
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:58,660
service provided by PCH is being enjoyed

270
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:02,620
by dirty teaser<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sochi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> xenakis is</font>

271
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:05,880
part of that service so when do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

272
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:09,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">they in doing that lady and a service</font>

273
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,980
offered TLD later to tease it and they

274
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:15,310
are secondary or second-level domains

275
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:19,779
about seven of them Oh being saved with

276
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:23,229
PCH so in reality the the dirty<font color="#E5E5E5"> set is</font>

277
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:26,350
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a presence in more than 30</font>

278
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:31,000
locations globally so it was that is a

279
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:34,480
good thing from PCH and on the NSA

280
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,350
deployment using the PCH platform what

281
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,649
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should say is that the we all know</font>

282
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:44,579
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DNS SEC implementation predicts</font>

283
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:47,740
a lot of challenges that is obvious

284
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:52,599
including the cost of deploying the head

285
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:54,190
and to the management<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the keys we are</font>

286
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,649

<font color="#E5E5E5">Trustee leakage what could happen that</font>

second and its role in<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity is</font>

340
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:43,630
it an oversimplification to say that it

eliminates or does it simply minimize

342

346
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:59,150
DNS second exactly what it's doing when

347
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:01,370
you query the domain name system to

348
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,160
figure out from a hostname to an IP

349
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,370
address to resolve where you want to go

350
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:10,700
in the past that's all been done over

351
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:14,209
UDP mostly in secure protocol with no

352
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,980
cryptographic verification that the

353
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,220
result<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get is actually the result</font>

354
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,080
that's intended by the name system so

355
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,690
essentially with DNS SEC what we're

356
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,840
doing is we're moving to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of</font>

357
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,550
queries that come back we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be over TCP</font>

358
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll be harder to spoof not impossible</font>

359
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,820
but harder but the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical</font>

360
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:35,030
component is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll be</font>

361
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,590
cryptographically signed so you have

362
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,059
much higher confidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to</font>

363
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,409
say it's a hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent secure</font>

364
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:41,178
because that gets security people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

365
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">trouble but it is a much higher</font>

366
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:46,400
confidence that the answer you get is

367
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:50,330
actually an answer that was intended and

368
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,100
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> first so it's an extra it's a if</font>

369
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,990
I can clarify for the for the person

370
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,300
that wrote in it's an extra level of

371
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,730
assurance that you you ended up where

372
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,110
you wanted to go precisely and the

382
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:21,170
higher confidence and the answers you

383
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:24,889
get back you may now start relying on

384
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:26,690
DNS for more and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we already see</font>

385
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,130
people writing articles and talking

386
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,290
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what other new innovations are</font>

possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's the part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

388
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:35,678
really exciting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me the</font>

00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:38,270
transformation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the way we interact I</font>

390
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,630
think any<font color="#E5E5E5"> time there's an increase in</font>

391
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:45,260
the level of law and order the level of

392
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:48,530
assurance in a system you find new uses

393
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:51,010
and people become comfortable relying

394
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:57,230
more upon the internet or upon any

395
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:59,420

the answers found in the domain name

said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the answer was this but you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">assertion theoretically the right person</font>

that assertion you as an end user would

434
00:21:54,070 --> 00:22:00,470
specifically what this facility is is a

435
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:02,720
hardened physical facility with five

436
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:07,910
layers of physical security surrounding

437
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:11,980
a set of cryptographic keys that are

438

00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:21,170
as we go forward in the year so

441
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,840
responsibility for the cryptographic

442
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:26,360
security and the physical security is

443
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,810
divided into two non-overlapping groups

444
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:33,469
of people for the physical security two

445

455
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:07,010
the room with us today I joined us each

say at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google's browser</font>

473
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:55,850
Chrome has just announced a new version

474
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:57,560
that uses DNS SEC to visually indicate

the security of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

477
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,610
are on track to do the same thing

478
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:07,310
people's email software over time will

479
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:10,040
also use DNS SEC and eventually all

480
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:15,470
Internet applications will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> upgraded</font>

481
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:18,620
to to utilize this additional level of

00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:21,440
security in the meantime if someone is

483
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:24,139
suspicious they can use tools to do

484
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,150
manual verification of the DNS X

485
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,559
signature there are many online sites

486
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,480
that will

487
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:32,509
allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check the validity of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tsx</font>

492
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:47,629
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> require a very big facility in</font>

493
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:50,659
terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the space basically it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a set</font>

494
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:53,120
box running by itself and then I in

495
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:54,799
terms of starving I guess all the

496
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,199
operations are provided and support

497
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:00,289
provided by PCH<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so they can do</font>

498
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,509
either remotely or on-site<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so in</font>

499
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:04,970
those facilities in terms of for penis

500
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:10,909
that it doesn't require<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of space</font>

501
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:12,830
day the course of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it um are in terms of</font>

502
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:15,110
the constructing diversity I'm talk

503
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:20,029
about the physical space is in the

504
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:21,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">region</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of 20,000 saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but of</font>

505
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:25,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">course they basically excluding the</font>

506
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:27,830
equipment and all the other facilities I

507
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:30,710
think it's fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that the system</font>

508
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:33,070
overall including all the space<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

509
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:36,110
forth is several million dollars

510
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:38,629
obviously a huge portion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that is the</font>

511
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:41,600
physical space that's being used in each

512
00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:45,320
of these secure facilities so we are

513
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,509
greatly indebted to Marcel and to Tommy

514
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,720
and to<font color="#CCCCCC"> equinix for the facility in the</font>

515
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:52,509
United States because there's is is

516
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,679
probably the single largest contribution

517
00:25:52,509 --> 00:26:00,139
i can has supported this in by giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

518
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:03,649
moral support by giving us the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

519
00:26:00,139 --> 00:26:05,360
the first place and by seconding one of

520
00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:07,489
their staff in part of his time<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

521
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">last year to provide the expertise and</font>

522
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">help us understand how exactly the route</font>

523
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:16,429
was done so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could replicate that</font>

524
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:18,919
in an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source way the as tommy said</font>

525
00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:20,740
the physical facility is<font color="#E5E5E5"> two meters by</font>

526
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:22,759
well he<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was very small</font>

527
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,740
specifically it's only two meters by

528
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:27,529
three meters all three facilities are

529
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:31,879
identical they have exactly the same

530
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:35,389
equipment in them and so inside that 2

531
00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:37,418
by 3 meter room is a skiff a secure

532
00:26:35,389 --> 00:26:39,830
compartment of the compartmentalized

533
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:41,360
information facility which is

534
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:44,510
essentially an even some

535
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,299
our mettle room that locks up tight and

536
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:50,929
inside that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an IPS which is a safe</font>

537
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:54,620
and inside that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an HSM a hardware</font>

538
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:56,960
signing module so this is many physical

539
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,879
layers of security each one more

540
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,500
difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> penetrate than the last and</font>

541
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:08,480
each one requiring a greater level of

542
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:10,490
authorization to access when will the

543
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,010
other two sorry Vivian from<font color="#CCCCCC"> ZDNet Asia</font>

544
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:15,440
when will the other two facilities be

545
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:19,010
ready and just mentioned earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

546
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:25,100
the 14 ccTLDs how many of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are from</font>

547
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:29,799
Asia okay so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me start with the</font>

548
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:32,120
timeline the San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jose facility is</font>

549
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:34,910
operational and has been operational for

550
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:37,610
the past three months but the physical

551
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:41,179
security of the five layers only<font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font>

552
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:43,100
completed the same thing is true of the

553
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:44,510
Singapore facility the Singapore

554
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,059
facility has been operational since

555
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:50,059
monday of this week when we did the

556
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:52,490
signing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again only four</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the five</font>

557
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:54,260
layers of physical security are complete

558
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:57,350
the fifth layer of physical security

559
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:59,870
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be finished in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> August for the other</font>

560
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:02,090
two facilities were aiming for September

561
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:04,820
and october respectively September for

562
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:08,840

Central<font color="#E5E5E5"> Asia and there are a bunch in</font>

567
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:30,918
the Pacific Islands but so far it's it's

568
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:32,660
mostly been fairly small countries one

569
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:35,510
of the reasons James is here with us is

570
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:38,030
because Tanzania is not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second</font>

571
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:40,040
most recent now<font color="#E5E5E5"> country to join the</font>

572
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:42,590
system but is also the largest country

573
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,210
to join the system so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far this is whale</font>

574
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:47,629
informed about the Chinese paper in

575
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:49,220
Singapore are three questions the first

576
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:52,250
one would be what is the benefit of

577
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:55,070
having three different locations for for

578
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:56,899
i canna bch itself number two would be

579
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:59,980
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking to expand the facility</font>

580
00:28:56,899 --> 00:29:03,289

585
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:18,380
question I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think three if you look at</font>

586
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:22,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> history of the domain name system</font>

587
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:23,600
it's a distributed system and it's

588
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:26,860
gained a lot of its strengths and

589
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:30,259
resiliency due to having very many

590
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:33,289
components just spread across geographic

591
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:35,659
regions it allows for<font color="#E5E5E5"> faster responses</font>

592
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:37,870
from a local geographic region that

593
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:42,620
allows isolation in case there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

594
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:44,959
natural disaster or man-made accident so

595
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:47,389
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> from from our perspective the</font>

596
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,669
more facilities the better<font color="#CCCCCC"> adds the</font>

597
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:52,519
overall resiliency of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the domain name</font>

598
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:54,289
system and from where I sit I would be

599
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:56,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">nervous if everything existed in one</font>

600
00:29:54,289 --> 00:30:01,549
facility I like the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

601
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:04,639
distributed model to follow on to that a

602
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:07,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit on the first question because</font>

603
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:09,289
the users of this system are national

604
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,899
governments and national governments

605
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:15,919
often have little reason to trust each

606
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:18,889
other if this facility were hosted in

607
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,019
any one country there would be some

608
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:22,570
subset of other countries in the world

609
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:25,129
that would not trust that country

610
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:27,710
therefore we chose three different

611
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:30,740
countries which are not particularly

612
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:32,809
aligned with each other and all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font>

613
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:36,019
are relatively<font color="#E5E5E5"> trusted by many other</font>

614
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:38,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">countries now every time a signature is</font>

615
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:41,600
done it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> compared between the</font>

616
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:43,519
locations and if any location does not

617
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,668
agree with the others we throw an error

618
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:49,850
we publish the fact that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

619
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:53,500
difference and that that's made public

620
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:56,269
for the world to see so if for instance

621
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">the United States government decided to</font>

622
00:30:56,269 --> 00:31:03,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">tamper with the results of the signing</font>

623
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:05,389
the Zurich and Singapore results would

624
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:07,039
be different but they would agree with

625
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:09,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">each other and that would be made</font>

626
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,810
evident for the world to see immediately

627
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:14,090
therefore it serves as a deterrent to

628
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:16,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">any government to tamper with the system</font>

629
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:18,889
and it serves as an assurance to other

630
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:21,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">governments that the system is secure</font>

631
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:23,840
and is not being tampered with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

632
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,970
transparent so that's the reason for

633
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,830
three facilities we could of course do

634
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:30,440
more facilities but the facilities are

635
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:34,220
very expensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> to operate and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

636
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:37,040
that three is a reasonable compromise we

637
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,380
were asked two weeks ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> afrinic</font>

638
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,050
meeting in dar Salam why there was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

639
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:44,900
facility in Africa and honestly the

640
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:47,210
reason was simply because our budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

641
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:50,780
limited and we needed to choose three

642
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:54,410
locations and we went<font color="#CCCCCC"> for three that had</font>

643
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:56,750
the ability to to support us through

644
00:31:54,410 --> 00:32:00,080
donating the facilities and were in

645
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:03,050
highly trusted countries so moving on to

646
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,620
the second question are we looking to

647
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:10,550
expand the facilities as we add more

648
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:14,570
countries the physical facility need not

649
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:16,760
expand another very minor difference

650
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:20,179
between the route and<font color="#E5E5E5"> our system is that</font>

651
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:22,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">although</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are using the same hsm the</font>

same<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware signing module we're using</font>

653
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:28,160
a faster version of it the route because

654
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:31,250
it needs to only generate<font color="#E5E5E5"> a small number</font>

655
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:35,150
of keys and only infrequently every few

00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:37,640
months they they have no particular

657
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:39,830
performance requirement we because we

658
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">are assigning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these zones constantly you</font>

659
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:44,449

660
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:48,889
a new signature we have to have the

661
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:51,770
higher performance module so as we add

662
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:55,010
more domains if performance requires it

663
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:57,320
we will paralyze by adding more of these

664
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:59,540
Hardware signing modules the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Agra sunny</font>

669
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,320
on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the third question I'm going to</font>

670
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:20,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">punt back to Jeff on this because the</font>

671
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,990
question why are there five layers of

672
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:27,220
security again

673
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:31,059
CH is emulating the route exactly as

674
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:34,000
exactly as we're able to in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order that</font>

675
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:36,070

676
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,910
the system will<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have to learn and</font>

677
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:43,330
understand two different<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems so Jeff</font>

678
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:46,030
can answer why the five<font color="#E5E5E5"> layers because</font>

679
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:49,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> facility's the root tiny facilities</font>

680
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:50,649
are in the United States they were

681
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:53,889
modeled after the highest level of

682
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:58,809
security based on US federal standards

683
00:33:53,890 --> 00:34:01,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">fisma high</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security and so a lot of</font>

684
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:05,620
those standards came out of the cold war

685
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:07,179
and military sort of worst-case thinking

686
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,690
so that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see so many</font>

687
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:14,260
overlapping layers of security and

688
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:15,460
physical controls and so to make the US

689
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,139
government comfortable with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

690

standards<font color="#E5E5E5"> we emulated what they thought</font>

691
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:20,500
were the<font color="#E5E5E5"> highest levels of security and</font>

692
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:23,080
would give us<font color="#CCCCCC"> the highest level</font>

693
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:26,350
assurance so it's sort of like we

so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> something we just invented</font>

700

there's a long history but<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind why</font>

701
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:48,250
these decisions were made hi I'm Harry

from Reuters<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow-up to your answer to</font>

704

system and make it the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

appear to be genuine welded the one

who's not is oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so hypothetically</font>

708
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:11,109
hypothetically anything is possible and

709
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:13,390
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security person one ever says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

something will not<font color="#CCCCCC"> or cannot happen</font>

711
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:20,400
because that's tempting fate part of the

712
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:22,630
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we chose Singapore and</font>

Switzerland and the United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

714
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:27,040
because these are countries particularly

00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,710
Switzerland and Singapore that have a

716
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:35,350
long reputation of neutrality and of

717
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:36,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">independence and so first of all we try</font>

718
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:39,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">and minimize the likelihood</font>

719
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:42,670
of such an occurrence secondly we try

00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:45,100
and maximize<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transparency so that if</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that it would be very apparent so in</font>

723
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,590
each facility there are three video

724
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:56,800
cameras publishing continual video

725
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:59,380
surveillance of the the skiff<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet so anyone on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet can</font>

727
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:04,990
observe all three facilities at all

728
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:07,480
times to see that no one has gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

729
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:09,339
the room and laid a hand on the skiff if

730
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,380
someone were<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to the skiff they</font>

731
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,720
would then have to open it and get to

732
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:15,190
the IPS inside that if they were to get

733
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,069
to the IPS they would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to somehow</font>

734
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:19,960
open that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get to the hsm if they got</font>

735
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:22,780
to the hsm then they would need to

736
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,600
compromise at least three of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the seven</font>

737
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:27,970
trusted people to get the cryptographic

738
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:30,880
key material that activates the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hsm</font>

739
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:32,589
otherwise even shaking the hsm will just

740
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,500
cause it to erase all of its<font color="#CCCCCC"> contents</font>

741
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:39,970
and again that is made<font color="#CCCCCC"> public as it</font>

742
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:42,010
happens so um yeah I and the other thing

743
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">is since these sites are constantly</font>

744
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:45,700
cross checking each other if you were to

745
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,740
make a change you would have to do it at

746
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,600
the exact same moment otherwise you

747
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,160
would see one country changed it then

748
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,420
another country changed it and you could

749
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together the order in which this</font>

750
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:57,520
occurred so if you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

751
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,610
it look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a third country changed it</font>

752
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,190
you would see this time disparity Jeff

753
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:04,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">um just that I mentioned that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give me a</font>

754
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,430
second we<font color="#CCCCCC"> pulled up you can do new</font>

755
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:08,740
things not<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible before could you get</font>

756
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:14,020
exam off so these new things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font>

757
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:16,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible with the NSA well I can just</font>

758
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:21,040
speculate because some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

759
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:22,870
aren't being done but for example now

760
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,630
that responses are coming out of the DNS

761
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:27,520
SEC enabled servers over TCP packet

762
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:30,370
sizes are larger responses can be bigger

763
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:36,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there's already work being done in</font>

764
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:38,380
IETF and some other forms on extensions

765
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:40,150
like there's a proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a Dane</font>

766
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:43,060
extension allowing you to publish your

767
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:46,900
own ssl certificate within the DNS

768
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:48,370
response but from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my perspective there's</font>

769
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,380
no reason why you couldn't publish other

770
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:53,470
information in the DNS SEC so

771
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:56,650
right now you ask a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question who is you</font>

772
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:58,270
know QQ in<font color="#CCCCCC"> China and you get an IP</font>

773
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,400
address back but there's no reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

774
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:03,070
you couldn't ask for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> recipe for dinner</font>

775
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,890
and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that answer back or ask for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

776
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:07,480
photograph<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a cat and get that back</font>

777
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:09,700
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you could</font>

778
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,990
store potentially and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we're at</font>

779
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,759
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> very beginning of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this innovation</font>

780
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,200
and I think the domain name system will

781
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,900
be doing many things it was not really

782
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,879
intended to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a decade from now and</font>

783
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:23,140
from my standpoint that changes the risk

784
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:25,120
model because all of our models were

785
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:27,220
designed on IP addresses but yet now

786
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:31,120
we'll be doing more and I find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

787
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:35,700
fascinating I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like to</font>

788
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:37,750
stress Jeff's response about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dane that a</font>

789
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:41,980
Dane is probably the<font color="#E5E5E5"> single most</font>

790
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:44,560
important follow on from DNS SEC DNS SEC

791
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:49,330
itself is a building block and it

792
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:53,340
provides a hugely useful increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

793
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:56,980
security of of DNS lookups right of

794
00:38:53,340 --> 00:39:00,370
getting answers to DNS queries but

795
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:03,160
beyond that using it as a building block

796
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:06,370
to enable a higher level of security for

797
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:09,160
web transactions and for voice over IP

798
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:11,140
if you wanted to authenticate a phone

799
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,359
call there's no reason why you couldn't

800
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:17,770
use Dane and there is in fact a

801

standards effort to apply to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use these</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then sip on top of that to</font>

these building blocks come into popular

usage the things that the top of that

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,270
how about

821
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:09,060
more communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> would occur if you</font>

the email from my bank and not fear that

00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:17,010
it's a phishing attack or I could

sort of bit too pie-in-the-sky at least

at this stage I'll take the liberty of

00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:57,540
instance was a new way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a</font>

864
00:41:54,450 --> 00:42:00,359
contact database but would DNS SEC sort

865
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:06,060
of change possibly a way of the idea

866
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:08,760
well the what a new GG Tod might do or

867
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:11,700
you just can't tell for now well there

868
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">are certainly new gTLDs that have as</font>

part of their business<font color="#E5E5E5"> model been</font>

870
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:22,760
counting on DNS SEC for instance there

871
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:29,580
is a financial services tlv that will

872
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:31,320
probably apply that will have a very

873
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,810
strong chain of trust all the way

874
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">through from each bank to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end user</font>

using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Deanna sec so yes there that is</font>

876
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,140
integrated it doesn't particularly have

877
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:45,420
to do with with our platform which is

878
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,129
ccTLD specific at the moment I'd like to

879
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,230
relay one question that we got online

880
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:52,680
mr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> Woodcock explained the country</font>

881

<font color="#E5E5E5">Tanzania always join innovations we like</font>

887
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:15,420
innovations and because the DNS SEC has

888
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:19,440
been a global agenda and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't want</font>

889
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:22,230
to be left out and i hear a bid has put
