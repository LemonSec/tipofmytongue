users across the globe what we thought

78
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,420
at the time was a staggering number

79
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:21,030
fifty-six percent of those original 170

80

and thanks to a speech by Lee Kuan Yew

the prime minister of Singapore from

nineteen fifty nine to nineteen ninety

165

00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,179
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee first came to Singapore it was</font>

169
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:46,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">famous mostly as a backwater port known</font>

170
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,380
for piracy smuggling and as a

171
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,639
stopping-off point for sailors it was a

172
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,919
city with no significant natural

173
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,840
resources other than its people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

174
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,930
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardworking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and semi-skilled</font>

175
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,960
and what he forged from that beginning

176
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,360
was the fifth richest nation on earth in

177
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,489
a few decades that nation was

178
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,009
revolutionized through science education

179
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:09,199
and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus on high-tech industries the</font>

180
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">workforce is now highly skilled building</font>

183
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,600
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world of course there were bumps</font>

184
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,010
on the road top scientists didn't want

185
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,380
to stay here there were no cultural

186
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:24,560
amenities or attractions<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be found so</font>

187
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">Lee's government founded foster the Arts</font>

189
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,448

00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,949
ranks among the top nations for science

191
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:35,870
so to me what Lee and Singapore

192
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:37,449
accomplished reminds us of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the power of</font>

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet and why we're here today</font>

194
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:42,080
the internet now is the same tool that

195
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,880
connects people to culture to fellow

196
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,370
researchers to cutting-edge technologies

197
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,620

work here is so important of course it's

204
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,280
poignant for me because as many of you
