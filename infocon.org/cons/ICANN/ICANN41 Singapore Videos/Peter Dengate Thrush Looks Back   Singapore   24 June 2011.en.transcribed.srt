<font color="#CCCCCC">that means for you sure Brad it's</font>

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,889
certainly mixed emotions on the one hand

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's been a tremendously exciting time</font>

7

years that I can we've achieved an

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,480
enormous amount as a team we've had

15
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,010
collectively working on that's

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,839
thoroughly tested all of our policy

17
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,219
development mechanisms and and we've now

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,829
come out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with us with this good</font>

19
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,120
program we've had the changing of the

tremendous success and tremendous

26
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,739
movement on so many things so it's been

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,750
good to be part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that it'll I'll be</font>

28
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,339
sorry to lose the intensity<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

29
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,440
passion<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's gone around those</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">here since before there wasn't I can and</font>

32
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,530
that's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> an fear I feel it's a time</font>

33
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,350
to move on and there's a tremendous crop

34
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,880
of new board members and new counselors

35
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,770
and new volunteers throughout their

36
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,020
account organization we've seen in an

enormous growth<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the CC NSA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

original reasons for coming to I can and

42
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,049
we've seen strong growth than the

<font color="#CCCCCC">committee and everywhere so I'm feeling</font>

45
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,200
it's time to move on and looking forward

49
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,490
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> this has taken a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of time</font>

50
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,310
and energy that I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to give</font>

51
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,720
and it'll be nice to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of that</font>

messages coming and flowers and support

which made me realize you know that I

84
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,820
had friends all through the community

85
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:57,920
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the family and then since then the</font>

being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to devote energy to to these</font>

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,359
projects in some ways has been a kind of

88
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,860
soulless actually working you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

89
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,960
wouldn't call it a distraction but it's

90
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,120
been a very happy way of throwing myself

91
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,160
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it another set of challenges which</font>

92
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,990
in some ways of sort of compensated for

93
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,579
the terrible loss what's the most

94
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,590
difficult part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing what you do</font>

95
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:19,990
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than answering questions like the</font>

96
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:22,280
last one I it's keeping it's keeping the

97
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,600
harnessing the energy I think there's a

98
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,550
tremendous<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of energy coming from</font>

99
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,109
all quarters all of it well intentioned

100
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,090
but all<font color="#E5E5E5"> are much of it pulling in</font>

101
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,500
slightly different directions so I see

102
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,360
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much as harnessing that</font>

103
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,280
direction harnessing that energy and and

104
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,350
photo had pointed in the what seems to

105
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">be the consensus is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best direction</font>

106
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,769
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think is</font>

107
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,500
necessarily best it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

108
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,880
establish what the general consensus<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

109
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,650
the best direction and then making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

110
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,500
we keep going<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way is it the</font>

111
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,000
definition of where you need to go is it

112
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,550
the definition or building that

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,500
consensus I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

114
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:57,860
latter I think what the processes we

115
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:01,220
have do is expose the issue generate the

116
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:03,140
views about that and in some sense of

117
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,240
priority about them and then the chairs

118
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,769
job is basically to make sure that the

119
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,200
most important tasks are being dealt

120
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:13,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">with first so keeping the priority of</font>

121
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,608
the organization orderly and then making

122
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,829
sure then the energy is harnessed around

123
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,570
those priorities and in those directions

124
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:23,330
some people have said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that being I can</font>

125
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,050
board share is like herding cats unfair

126
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,150
accurate

127
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:29,750
yes I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a cliche that doesn't</font>

128
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:32,628
really apply that well to to that too<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

129
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,030
can because the so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different parts</font>

130
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:36,650
to it and i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the differences</font>

these are completely different groups<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

137
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,639
think you know the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cats is at</font>

least<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're dealing with a single</font>

00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,599
species whereas here we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this this</font>

140
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,030
wonderful<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-stakeholder model and</font>

141
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:57,289
all those stakeholders a very different

come from different backgrounds have

143
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:00,530
different needs have come to I can for

00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:05,810
job is keep trying to get the alignment

147
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,878
of interests and working or what the

148
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">common factors are and once that being</font>

149
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,469
done then executing on that on that

150
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:14,870
particular issue but you you mentioned

151
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:17,060
that almost casually I<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine finding</font>

152
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:20,930
that point of commonality on any given

153
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:24,319
issue I don't see how you're able to do

154
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:26,120
that factoring in not only<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

155
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,150
multi-stakeholder model where people are

156
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,440
coming from but the regional diversity

157
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're right to add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in as well and</font>

158
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,159
there's linguistic diversity and

159
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:36,529
cultural<font color="#E5E5E5"> and religious and ethnic and</font>

160
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:39,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">other other diversities say yes it's</font>

161
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:40,880
complicated well what we do what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

162
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:43,909
though is we create platforms for

163
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,319
discussion around those topics we have

164
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:48,409
an open and transparent bottom-up

165
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,120
process which takes into account all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

166
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:52,400
those different processes every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

167
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,900
voice is heard and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we take enough</font>

168
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,969
time I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> to distill the issues</font>

169
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,409
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the particular forums and</font>

170
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:59,389
through the discussion processes and the

171
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:02,240
public comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> process is that that</font>

172
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:04,340
eventually from all that diversity I

173
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,529
think she can come some kind of coherent

174
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,849
view and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they take the new gTLD</font>

175
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:09,229
program we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> very different views</font>

176
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:10,580
about about whether we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have it at</font>

177
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:12,199
all if we should have it when we should

178
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,479
have it and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> should the features of</font>

179
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,639
it be and this week we've managed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

180
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of crystal or lies all those into a</font>

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">program which most people regard is</font>

182
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,550
pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody thinks it could be</font>

183
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:23,870
improved by giving them what they wanted

184
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,520
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't get in the in the</font>

185
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,229
consensus building process and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

186
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,000
that's probably a healthy sign that's

187
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:30,500
the usual sign of good consensus when

188
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,139
everyone can live with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone's</font>

189
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,729
got some slight slight beef about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

190
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:37,720
aspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it that they could improve</font>

191
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:39,760
when you put the approval of the GT

192
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,560
the program at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of your list of</font>

193
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,700
accomplishments I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I would I</font>

194
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,740
think it's one that's certainly one of

195
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,180
the biggest activities that we've done

196
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,520
it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been the biggest budget activity</font>

197
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,920
has taken the longest it's also going to

198
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,930
most dramatically change the the look of

199
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,420
the internet for ordinary<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet users</font>

200
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,190
so so clearly it's one of the most one

201
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:00,580
of the most significant achievements of

202
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:04,540
I can in my time but I think equally

203
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,950
important would be long term for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

future<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet would be the</font>

205

changing of the relationship with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:13,539
United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> government and moving away</font>

207
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,340
from the sense that that I can was if

208
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,900
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> like an organ of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> United States</font>

210
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,690

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationship between I can in the US</font>

213
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think shifting from it from I can</font>

being accountable to the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> government</font>

218
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,150

00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen in the end is more significant I</font>

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,419
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in five or six years time people</font>

223
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,000
become so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> embedded as part of the</font>

224
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,919
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process that the fact that</font>

225
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,990
we had to go through a process to get

226
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,849
they will become lost and historically

227
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,310
what will be more important as the is

228
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:57,850
the expanding responsibility of I can as

229
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,380
the steward of all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that service and I</font>

230
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,030
suppose a corollary to that as the

231
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,700
growing support of governments for the

232
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:05,559
multi-stakeholder model as evidenced by

233
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">their participation in the gac itself</font>

234
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,830
and also by the defense that we get from

235
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,050
governments of the multi-stakeholder

236
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,669
model and other for in their own

237
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,900
countries I think I think the

238
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:17,289
development of the multi-stakeholder

239
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,780

245
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,349
have grown up nationally you think of

246
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:34,990
broadcasting which is now global and as

247
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:37,180
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of air travel for example</font>

248
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,520
which is global or credit cards which

249
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:41,859
operator we've got other systems but

250
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,510
they've all grown up nationally and then

251
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,190
there's been bilateral<font color="#E5E5E5"> and invert</font>

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,870
multilateral treaties which have

explained them where's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet sort</font>

254
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,050
of wind global almost immediately and

255
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,920
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to develop a global solution</font>

256
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,769
straight

257
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,349
way and the multi-stakeholder model that

258
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:58,120
we've pioneered is the way i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

259
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,649
the development of that and then

00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,300
historically<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be seen as more</font>

undertaken like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITN's or new gTLDs so in</font>

264
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,660
other words what you're saying is you've

265
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,300
seen an actual reshaping of the

266
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,160
organization you seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be saying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

267
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,500
the reshaping of the organizers

269
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,160
achievement<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah well not the reshaping</font>

270
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,329
of the organization in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Timmy we</font>

271
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,760
certainly done a lot of that I've seen

272
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:27,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">it grow from a staff of three or four to</font>

273
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,769
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> staff of now between 120 100 and sort</font>

274
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,209
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 depending on how you do the count</font>

275
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,410
we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a complete change of the of</font>

00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:34,180
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cab of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the board committee</font>

277
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,189
structures for example we created new

00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:38,410
board committee so that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them all</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of the work now done by i can haz has</font>

280
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,829
board oversight which i think is what

281
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,510
the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> was wanting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not really</font>

talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internal mechanisms</font>

they will change and<font color="#E5E5E5"> adjust as the</font>

circumstances change and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will it will</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">adapt the organization to fit I'm much</font>

00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:54,069
more concerned I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think with the the role</font>

287
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,800
of the organization the principle of

00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:59,019
having a multi-stakeholder organization

289
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,240
responsible for this crucial resource I

00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:02,620
think the relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that body</font>

291
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,839
has had with the international community

292
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:08,050
I think that change is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

293
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:11,649
important one<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what extent did the</font>

294
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:13,689

295
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:15,790
relationship between I can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,199

297
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it redefined it I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think what it</font>

298
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:22,240
was was because it's already defined in

299
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,769
the bylaws we've created the

300
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,050
governmental advisory committee to give

301
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:27,790
us advice on matters of public policy

302
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,349
that is the proper domain of governments

303
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,689
they they're the experts in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

304
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:34,060
they have a very legitimate and historic

305
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,410
concern for protecting the public<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy</font>

306
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,689
interest in protecting the rights of

307
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:41,399
citizens they deal with issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can and they pour not a</font>

pornography and all those sorts of

311
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,980
issues that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not part of the I can</font>

312
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:53,109
mandate we have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> them involved to</font>

313
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,519
deal with those<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues and we've created</font>

314
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,260
a situation where they can give<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

315
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:57,880
advice and we can consider that advice

316
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,500
and historically we haven't had a

317
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,569
circumstance where we've disagreed with

318
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,449
that advice but the bylaw was provide

319
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:04,810
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and what the new gtld process</font>

320
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:06,250
is

321
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,349
has actually tested all of the available

322
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,870
mechanisms I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the first time</font>

323
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:13,330
we've never had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a an issue which has</font>

324
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,160
crossed across all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the constituency's</font>

325
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:17,820
including the government's and required

326
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,439
such an extensive sort of cross-cultural

327
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,420
cross-organizational discussion so I

328
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,100
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it hasn't changed the</font>

329
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationship but it certainly tested all</font>

330
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,230
of the mechanisms Peter you took some

331
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,870
criticism after the last meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in San</font>

celebrating its passage the criticism

336
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,830
being that passage was preordained well

337
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,210
it wasn't pre or dating the passage but

338
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,339
it seemed<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty clear to me at a time</font>

339
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,500
that certainly we were converging to a

340
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:52,720
point where we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to move</font>

341
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,670
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a successful program my</font>

342
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,200
comment was much more about if we were

343
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,120
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to that stage that would</font>

344
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,310
certainly be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moment to stop and pause</font>

345
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,720
and and just recognize the effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

346
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,880
had gone into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from every element in</font>

347
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,420
the community we've had intense debates

348
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,339
between 5th their adherents and

349
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,020
supporters of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept of freedom of</font>

350
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:12,400
speech and they've come into conflict

351
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,020
with some of the aspects of intellectual

352
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">property rights and trademarks a very</font>

353

healthy tension in society and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I can</font>

354
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,260
and we've resolved that satisfactory

355
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,459
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a huge tension between</font>

356
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,740
governments who have been concerned

357
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,600
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what would happen if sensitive</font>

358
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,580

sensitivities what was going to happen

if they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> through what would be the</font>

362
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,290
prices and we've resolved that so I

363
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">think my comment was I could see that we</font>

364
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,530
were coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the point which we've now</font>

365
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,300
reached here in Singapore and that when

366
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,069
we did it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an appropriate time</font>

367
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,719
to stop and just market in some way as

368
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,850
the success of the multi-stakeholder

369
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,800
model and soul than what's being a set

370
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,080
of very difficult problems talk to me a

371
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,240
little bit about the external perception

372
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,339
of ICANN are people starting to

373
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,070
understand its role well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it has</font>

374
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:58,600
i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've seen some changes in that</font>

375
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,240
for example it's not it's now routinely

376
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,700
studied as a matter of masters and PhD

377
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,500
theses<font color="#CCCCCC"> as multi-stakeholder model and</font>

378
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,080
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet governance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are these</font>

379
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">are actually recognized academic topics</font>

380
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,250
when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't 11 or 12 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago 11</font>

381
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,599
or 12 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and probably up till</font>

382
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,190
about five years ago we would hear

383
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,080
people talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> experiment</font>

384
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,600
and it was an experiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> could a</font>

385
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,279
multi-stakeholder model be built

386
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,230
that could coordinate this incredible

387
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:25,139
resource and we seem to have passed that

388
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,970
point we probably passed it four or<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

389
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:29,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really notice and</font>

390
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,889
so looking back we we observe it but we

391
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,690
no longer talk about the icon experiment

392
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:35,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is now the this is now a globally</font>

393
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,709
accepted method of doing this kind of

394
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,449
thing and we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that acceptance</font>

395
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:41,369
changing through the whistles process

396
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:44,008
where there was a heavy discussion at

397
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,079
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UN level about whether or not this</font>

398
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:47,490
kind of body should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be responsible for</font>

399
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,109
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> as important as this and in</font>

400
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:52,019
the in the conclusion<font color="#CCCCCC"> why as well yes it</font>

401
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:54,329
should so I think there's lots of signs

402
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:56,069
that that we've got that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

403
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:57,719
acceptance we've got all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the members</font>

404
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:59,130
of the g8 for example are now

405
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,399
contributing members of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our governmental</font>

406
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:04,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">advisory committee and that's out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

407
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">I say about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of 110 I think hundred and</font>

408
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,699
110 governments are now participating

409
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:10,709
actively in that so everywhere you look

410
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:13,490
now there's signs that this is accepted

411
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:16,949
it's working<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being supported</font>

412
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:19,050
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the change in New Zealand</font>

413
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:21,029
you're a well-respected barrister but I

414
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:24,240
imagine that being I can word share

415
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:26,910
probably consumes at least as much time

416
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">if not more as you're paid profession</font>

417
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:32,430
yes it's partly the nature of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

418
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:33,839
board it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a normal corporation and</font>

419
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,699
so it doesn't operate under normal

420
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,139
corporate governance rules We certainly

421
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:38,519
have all those as well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

422
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,750
fiduciary relationships we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

423
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,519
manage things like the budget and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">staff and relationships and contractual</font>

425
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,009
compliance that in preparing a strategic

426
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:49,529
plan etc that all corporations have so

427
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:51,449
on the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand we've got that gives me</font>

428
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:53,279
but in addition to that the board is

429
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:55,019
seen as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guardian of the public</font>

430
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">policy development process the board is</font>

431
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,920
the organ of last resort in this

432
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,810
multi-stakeholder model which is

433
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely different from an ordinary</font>

434
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:06,569
corporation we don't have shareholders

435
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,920
that we and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ordinary sins our</font>

436
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:11,160
shareholders are the multi-stakeholder

437
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,229
model constituencies and so the borders

438
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:17,009
is in the NBA at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the apex of that policy</font>

439
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:19,800
development process and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that reason</font>

440
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:22,589
the board has to get involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> very often</font>

441
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,359
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a much deeper level in the weeds of</font>

442
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,009
policy development process then we would

443
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,170
if we were an ordinary corporate board

444
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:29,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've sat on other boards and it's lovely</font>

445
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,559
to be able to ask the staff<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

446
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,609
this been through the prices are there

447
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:34,469
any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the board</font>

448
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,350
should be aware of and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer is yes</font>

449
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:39,120
no and then the board votes here the

450
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,010
board has got to get often deeply

451
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,899
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the issues and understanding</font>

452
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:45,269
and going back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community and so</font>

453
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:47,190
as a result of all that all of the board

454
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:49,440
members<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend far greater time on this</font>

455
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">than I would imagine on any other board</font>

456
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,579
commitment they have and and being a

457
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:55,319
chair<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just a larger example of that</font>

458
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:57,149
so yes it does take a considerable

459
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,950
amount of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> Peter what's next for you</font>

460
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:00,600
well I go back to news I have a short

461
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,769
holiday from here we're very interesting

462
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,649
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Asia or I'm going to take a</font>

463
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:06,480
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of days to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recover you know that</font>

464
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:08,490
and I can meeting for me runs for about

465
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,920
eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> days pretty intense meetings etc</font>

466
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,839
so we'll take a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> days after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that to</font>

467
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,779
recover and then I go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to New</font>

468
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:19,160
Zealand and try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> revive the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the law</font>

469
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:21,300
practice that I've had and I said as the

470
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,760
on a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of new zealand</font>

471
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,500
administrative and other tribunals and

472
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">i've got that kind of work to go back to</font>

473
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,630
finally Peter if you had any advice for

474
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:33,180
your successor what would it be I think

475
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:35,880
remain open to to the challenges that

476
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:38,040
come up from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community that's very</font>

477
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">very easy sometimes to think that</font>

478
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,819
there's a right way of doing things but

479
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,469
the multi-stakeholder model will will

480
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,709
change any views<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have about</font>

481
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,240
that so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeping in mind open to</font>

482
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:49,859
just two solutions that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community</font>

483
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,870
develops I suppose is probably the major

484
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,440
one Peter thank you very much thanks

485
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,440
brad has been a pleasure
