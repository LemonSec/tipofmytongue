of probabilities so when there's a

contractual dispute between two parties

156
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,789
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> balance that that's the fight</font>

159
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,440
of remedies aren't aren't ordinary

160
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:10,169
commercial situations one of them is the

161
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,760
urs the special situation that we've

162
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,650
designed for when a trademark owner is

163
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,240
using their trademark and suddenly

164
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,669
someone registers it and puts up some

165
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of infringing material or some some</font>

166
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,539
other abuse or damage<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that party</font>

167
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,820
we've created a brand new system the<font color="#CCCCCC"> urs</font>

168
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,800
to allow that trademark owner a very

169
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,810
rapid takedown now the trade-off that

170
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,580
owner has to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a very rapid</font>

171
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,650
takedown is they have to prove their

172
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,030
case to a high standard now the board

173
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,830
has absolutely no difficulty with that

174
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we think that the suggestion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

175
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,460
extraordinary remedy should be available

<font color="#E5E5E5">to anyone without a high standard of</font>

proof

178
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,870
you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just as just wrong</font>

179
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:45,229
thinking so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can work through those</font>

in relation to post dispute delegation

00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,780
post delegation dispute resolution

184
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,940
process this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a brand new remedy that</font>

185
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,169
wasn't created before under this a

186

registry now has a cause of action open

189
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,000
to them against the registry itself

190
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,469
previously they didn't they were again

191
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,840
the registry was regarded as a third

192
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,280
party outside the transaction you could

193
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,530
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the registrant and you could go</font>

after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the registry now under this</font>

provision you can go after the rigid

sorry registry you have the registrant

198
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,890
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go up to the registry</font>

199

itself and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the sections that's</font>

available to you is to actually can ever

I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> cancel the contract with the</font>

00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,420
in relation<font color="#CCCCCC"> SOUTHCOM domain name if a</font>

00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,370
in cahoots with some bad actors they can

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can cancel the contract</font>

with verisign to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> com just stop for a</font>

208
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,980
moment and think about the magnitude of

209
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,120
that as a remedy and then you'll

210
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,260
understand the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking of</font>

211
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,670
someone's going to bring a case like

212
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,700
that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to be argued and</font>

213
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:53,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">prove that a pretty high standard so I</font>

214
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,830
mean we can go on through through the

215
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,930
list perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kurt you on yet I've got</font>

216
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,370
one thing I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> add first few to</font>

217
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,920
which on your your first<font color="#E5E5E5"> point regarding</font>

218
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:04,470
the the trademark issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the clearing</font>

219
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,830
house and the provision of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proof of</font>

220
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:10,950
use one of the other additional reasons

221
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:14,969
why the thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that that step is</font>

222
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:16,890
valuable and and is has to do with the

223
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:22,640
fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that provides very useful</font>

224
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:25,710
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> for law enforcement so Kurt</font>

225
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,909
yeah I suppose I'm sorry you're the one

226
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,250
that we spent the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most time talking with</font>

227
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:31,320
a gag about as it happens was this

228
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,419
requirement for proof<font color="#E5E5E5"> of use in relation</font>

229
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:37,470
to use of these remedies that are

230
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:39,630
available and we obviously had a major

231
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,190
disconnect between what what the

232
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,500
government's thought we were doing and

233
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,780
what we think we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing what what</font>

234
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">though and they talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

235
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,290
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this kind of thing not being</font>

236
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,580
available in trademark law and that's

237
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,949
the clue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the difference what we've</font>

238
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,690
been creating<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

239
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,190
sunrise rights and we've been looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

240
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,310
the trademark and other qualifications

241
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,500
one needs to acquire a right in relation

242
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,819
to the sunrise and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe that and</font>

243
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,890
that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different from what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GAC</font>

244
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,960
seems to think the trademark should

245
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,220
should should do and that that everyone

246
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,810
who's got a registered<font color="#CCCCCC"> trademark or to</font>

247
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,850
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into that system and so</font>

248
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,170
we've we've maintained the proof of use

249
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,910
requirement for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons I think</font>

250
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:21,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we set out pretty clearly in the in</font>

251
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:24,870
this discussion with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the gag Raju but</font>

252
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,450
yes so anyway thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kevin I think it's</font>

253
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,550
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to recognize that we started</font>

254
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,910
with 12 major issue areas with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GAC</font>

255
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:36,540
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 sub issues and about 30</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

256
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:40,110
were a litany of trademark issues and

257
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,819
now we're down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

258
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,430
we're arguing about is Peter and rod

259
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,320
said were really 11 part of the

260
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,719
community thinks will better protect

261
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,310
trademark owners if we take 11 stance

262
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,710
and another section of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community</font>

263
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,569
thinks we should take another stance so

264
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:57,150
what we saw in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gac meeting yesterday</font>

265
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,040
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a spirited debate about the</font>

266
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,810
best way to protect register<font color="#CCCCCC"> anson the</font>

267
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,790
best way to protect trademark owners and

268
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,010
the board listen to all parts of the i

269
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,529
kin community and at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day</font>

270
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,720
there were you know for for very

00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:11,100
specific issues issue areas where

272
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,620
there's continuing to be a difference

273
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,200
among you know 30 other trademark issues

275
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,800
really reflects I think a spirit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

compromise and agreement I'm Raju

288
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,969
applications on January 12th and then

289
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,459
we'll be closing that window April

290
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,680
twelfth so it's open for 90 days the

291
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:01,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">specified minimum was 60 but we decided</font>

292

to roughly 90 days<font color="#CCCCCC"> to three months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

297
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:20,099
late in 2012 so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not forecasting ave</font>

00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:22,139
specifically will be completed by then

299
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,720
but that's the earliest possible time

300
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:27,089
and if you want any more details on that

301
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:35,220
Kurt has helped to architect the program

302

and can answer any more question<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds</font>

minor detail on that we have a sort of a

305
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:46,350
presumptive renewal in the contract so

306
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,240
when they sign the contract if they keep

307
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,470
performing according to the standards

308

they keep performing at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> appropriate</font>

336
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,319
decided to take additional time because

337
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:58,019
we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we really</font>

spread the word on this around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

339
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:03,120

342
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,720
we've decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to invest more in the</font>

343
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,430
communication program because we felt

344
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:16,050
that would be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best thing to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> serve</font>

345
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:18,109

<font color="#E5E5E5">we affect companies sure I think it</font>

354
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,440
depends on where you live in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

355
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:47,869
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if you live in Japan it's</font>

356
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,820
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mean that besides I know</font>

357
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,610
there's an application for the Japanese

358
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:55,100
ID and ccTLD I believe it's in the route

359
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:58,880
now is that correct Kurt<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm not</font>

360
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:01,519
sure but it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there could if if</font>

361
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,860
applicants came from Japan<font color="#E5E5E5"> there could</font>

be the equivalence of generic top-level

00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:13,970
example in kanji or katakana or hiragana

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,410
you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own local scripts the</font>

366
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:17,149
same thing for China it means that

whether you're in China or Singapore

00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:29,029
top-level domains in those scripts as

371
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:31,490
well as new terms that might be in Latin

372
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:34,130
scripts so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just it opens up the right</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dot so when you think comnet now</font>

ideas thank you another question from

376
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jonathan Hughes give us a rough guess if</font>

377

you can as to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> initial number of</font>

applicants you're expecting I thought

379
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:59,239
I'll answer that one if I can we don't

380
00:14:54,949 --> 00:15:01,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">have any specific expectation as we</font>

381
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,500
mention this morning there's about a

382
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:06,199
hundred and twenty different parties

383
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,519
that have said they intend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> file it</font>

384
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:09,910
through some public disclosure

385
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,620
statements and about 90 have websites

386
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:15,769
marketing their offerings but we do not

387
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:18,709
have a forecast and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason is is</font>

388
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:23,120
that we did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> receive support from the</font>

389
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:25,160
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to do an expression of</font>

390
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,949
interest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have allowed parties</font>

391
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,510
to indicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a year and a half ago</font>

392
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:30,770
whether they were interested or not and

393
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,939
I won't get in all the fine detailed

394
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,989
issues of why

395
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:35,149
the community didn't want to move

396
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:36,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">forward with that but in essence some</font>

397
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:38,449
people didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to lay the program</font>

398
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:40,159
and others thought it was in some way

399
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:47,779
stepping into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> program too soon but</font>

400
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:50,239
so we don't have a forecast<font color="#CCCCCC"> kiran hi i</font>

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:17,930
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not specify the precise mechanism</font>

561
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,350
whether that would be through a

00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:23,030
reduction in the application fee or

563
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,320
through some other capacity building or

564
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,330
technical assistance there's different

565
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,129
forms that could take and the reason the

566
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,620
board resolution didn't specify that is

567
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,570
because we haven't had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> input from</font>

the community yet the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jazz working group</font>

the it's up to working groups and the

574
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,950
supporting organizations like the gns<font color="#E5E5E5"> o</font>

00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:55,070
to decide their time frames for reports

their input as well as other input in in

578
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:04,610
the board's consideration of how the

579
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:07,220
board will approve a more specific

580
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:11,060
program but that we then will then go in

581
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:13,670
and execute I follow quickly so what if

582
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:16,040
the working group doesn't conclude and

583
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:18,560
the gns<font color="#E5E5E5"> o doesn't approve these rules</font>

00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:22,010
before the application period opens in

585
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">January then the board will need to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">consider alternatives and the</font>

590
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:37,490
to defer and wait to the second round

591
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:39,649

00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:54,360
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> with regard to the early</font>

636
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,260
warning system and got consensus which

637
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:01,290
is the crucial missing part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this left</font>

638
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:04,470
and I suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question is you agreed</font>

639
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:07,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GAC very strongly expressed the</font>

640
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:11,370
need for them to devise their own system

to what is consensus are the original

the

643
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,639
what the staff came up with was that we

00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:17,799
want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide an explanation as to</font>

why you are opposing a particular string

the simplest level they have to they

654
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:45,070
have to say what it is that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

655
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:47,590
objecting to but the GAC binds itself as

656
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:51,789
we all do by the basic I can principles

657
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:53,350
of accountability and transparency so

658
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:57,340
that was the proposed of the principles

659
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:58,539
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board was was pushing or well</font>

660
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,760
that was there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the side the board</font>

661
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:03,129
was coming from the GAC was coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

662
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,809
with the other principles that we also

663
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,330
respect which is national sovereignty

664
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:09,010
and the GAC working effectively in its

665
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:11,699
own and developing its own mechanisms

666
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:13,450
the last actual dispute was kind of

667
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,000
interesting and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we had done</font>

668
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,500
was taken the exact words that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came to</font>

669
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">us from the GAC and put them into the</font>

670
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,270
process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gang to actually we</font>

671
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:23,710
didn't mean you to use those words as

672
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:25,480
bylaws if you like as rules we while we

673
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,429
were signaling to you was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the process</font>

674
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we were going to use so we're quite</font>

675
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:31,110
happy having got that information to

676
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:33,639
sell right we'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the words up so</font>

677
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:35,350
there may be less to this dispute than

678
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,750
perhaps the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> back-and-forth might</font>

679
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,000
indicate what we all want as an

680
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:42,730
effective mechanism for the GAC which

681
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,169
we've set up to give us this advice well

682
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,789
we need is an effective mechanism for

683
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:47,770
that body that's so important to us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

684
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:50,230
be able to communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with us another</font>

685
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:51,970
thing I think is that we will grow in

686
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,710
the in the maturation of the

687
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,510
organization and as we face different

00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:58,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">issues different methods of</font>

689
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:00,210
communication will be appropriate<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

690
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:03,039
don't I don't think this should be a

sort of a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> area it'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be an area</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">third-party contracted resources and</font>

720
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:27,310
there's also a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> aside of roughly</font>

721
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:29,520
one-third for a reserve to cover

00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:32,590
potential litigation or other

723
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,930
contingencies that are not envisioned in

724
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:38,949
the regular operating costs I will let

725
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:42,400
Kurt expand on that if if you want any

726
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:44,880
further details<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so so rod was was</font>

727
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:49,030
pretty complete its I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ken's policy that</font>

728
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,820
the evaluation fee is charged on a cost

729
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:53,440
recovery basis so just matches the costs

730
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:56,770
associated with evaluating the

731
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,840
applications and so as rod said the

732
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:01,810
application processes were costed out

733
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,149
for the six different evaluations that

734
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:07,030
each application goes through there's

735
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:09,010
also a portion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> costs allocated to</font>

736
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:11,920
what you might term risk or contingency

737
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:15,430
but a number of low probability high

738
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:18,100
high cost items that may occur and what

739
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:20,650
the present value of those are and then

740
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,600
there's a smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost allocated to</font>

741
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:25,300
recovering the development<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs of the</font>

00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,909
policy directive that<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs be allocated</font>

that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> that cost be allocated out in</font>

748
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:51,710
we don't so the estimate may be low and

749
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:54,409
we we might have to increase fees in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

can say not-for-profit organization so

755
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,770
there are strict rules governing how we

756
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:15,979
could handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> that revenue and the</font>

757
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:17,870
revenue would be expended in accordance

758
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,210
with some sort of community discussion

759
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,699
that also that also meets our legal

760
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:26,600
requirements to maintain our

00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit to that because there really</font>

763
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:34,460
is only a very small prospect of there

being surpluses of any<font color="#E5E5E5"> as for the</font>

765
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,280
reasons that rod and Curtis said we

766
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,760
start on a cost recovery basis and we

767
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:42,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">monitor that and and and as we as we as</font>

00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,670
we go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiple rounds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the actual cost without</font>

774
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,730
surpluses there is a prospect that if

775
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,530
there are identical applications or two

776
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:00,020
or more applications and none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

777
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:01,520
evaluation processes separate them they

778
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,230
both end up at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same point in</font>

779
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,510
competition with each other this is what

780
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:06,890
we call string contention then the

781
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:10,190
community said the best way to resolve

782
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:11,540
who wins<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an auction and so there is</font>

783
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:13,250
that prospect that there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

784
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of identical applicants and</font>

785
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:17,690
applications now my personal guess is

786
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:19,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see very few of those as a</font>

787
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,960
businessman myself the last thing I

788
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,400
would want to do facing this kind of

789
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,900
situation is give I can a whole lot of

<font color="#E5E5E5">money when I could go into a deal with</font>

792

00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">that going on then and then auctions</font>

generating you know really exciting

795
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,040
surpluses but they do then the community

796
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,570
will come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

us but they've expressed it publicly

811
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:16,580
because we have not accept accepted any

if you scroll through one of those lists

which some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other journalists here</font>

posting on our website on this topic

866
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,670
where anybody can share their ideas of

867
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,280
what they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be the most</font>

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have another question from Monica</font>

00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:58,850
been completed<font color="#E5E5E5"> why not wait a few more</font>

876
00:35:53,510 --> 00:36:00,440
weeks or even a few more months I think

877
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:03,380
a number of board members said the

878
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,720
opposite in their own comments and Steve

879
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,220
Crocker I think his regard if you like

880
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,339
if not one of the fathers of the

881
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,810
Internet at least one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ankles in</font>

882
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,970
terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having been around and helping</font>

883
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:17,590
co-developed us you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 1960s</font>

884
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:19,700
and and somebody with tremendous

885
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:21,740
integrity and somebody that I respect

886
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,470
enormously in the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Steve's</font>

887
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,419
perspective was that unless there's some

888
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:28,819
reason to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold this back it should be</font>

889
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,140
allowed to go forward and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

890
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,640
never going to be never going to be

891
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:35,569
perfect but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the way things</font>

892
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:37,009
develop Steve's conclusion which I agree

893
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,410
with was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this program is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

894
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:40,880
is good and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sound and he's</font>

895
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,980
wholeheartedly behind it so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you</font>

896
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,560
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to contrast that if you like from</font>

897
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,120
the minority view which i think is in

898
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,830
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways is obviously a very safe you</font>

899
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,960
something will always be better if we

900
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:53,029
take longer to polish it the question is

901
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,670
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we hold up this enormous tide of</font>

902
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:57,950
enthusiasm this demand that's coming

903
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the community for this just so that</font>

904
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know marginally</font>

905
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:03,290
better and in the in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of the</font>

906
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,990
board took the view that enough was

907
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:07,100
enough and and and this good program has

908
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:10,549
certainly good enough and strong enough

909
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:12,799
to launch and here I me and if I'm sorry

910
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:14,960
and if I may add to that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

911
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,880
the diversity of our

912
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,210
ticular opinions issued by the board

913
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:24,890
also shows how seriously they take this

914
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:27,080
and other issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kieran hi Karen</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">which may I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know whether it's true</font>

920
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,710
recovery my understanding was that a big

00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:42,260
chunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the cost recovery was in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font>

that i can has already expended in order

923
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,849
to get here<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in that sense you're</font>

924
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,589
still getting hold of the money you'll

925
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:50,810
still have actual money in the bank

00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:58,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">with microsemi that is right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so my</font>

928
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:59,690
question is a slightly concerned that

929
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,700
you say well we'll do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it when the</font>

930
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,170
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> will go to the community if we</font>

931
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:06,470
get the money so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will</font>

932
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:08,839
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a big chunk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of money so</font>

933
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:10,640
is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> a plan in place now to start</font>

934
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:16,190
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community what do we do with</font>

935
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:18,618
this money so that that cost recovery of

936
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:20,900
developmental costs is about 25 or 26

937
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:22,810
thousand dollars per application so a

938
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,460
relatively small percentage of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

939
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:28,160
and it was intended to recover those

940
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,560
costs because we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the new</font>

941
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">gTLD applicants should be bearing the</font>

942
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,390
cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the development and not the</font>

943
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:37,760
registrants who are paying fees into I

944
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:40,069
can for all that time and so that money

945
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,080
is meant to be fed back into I can

946
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:46,010
remember that I cans a<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero-sum game</font>

947
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:49,490
it's a not-for-profit so monies received

948
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:52,310
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that relatively low level essentially</font>

949
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:53,479
just feed into<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cans budget then if I</font>

950
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:56,029
can't has enough money than it would

951
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,430
lower fees to registrants as a result so

952
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:00,710
like I said it's a zero-sum game at the

953
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:02,299
end and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended that the GNU GPL</font>

954
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,760
the applicant should pay the money and

00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:07,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">not registrants from the years during</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the development if I can just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> add to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that slightly you you know that i can</font>

on reserve one year of operating

962
00:39:17,869 --> 00:39:22,430
expenses in case something goes wrong we

963
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:24,440
regard the money that's been advanced

964
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:26,240
for the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld program as advances</font>

965
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,410
from that reserve fund and so the very

966
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,459
easiest thing is when the money comes

967
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,770
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to put it back</font>

968
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:33,349
top up the reserve fund which has been

969
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:36,349
running low if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like while this has</font>

970
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:38,540

971
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:40,250
as a windfall or profits this is putting

<font color="#E5E5E5">us back into the position that we think</font>

register dot com domains in Arabic and

981
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:05,859

984
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:17,270
augment the first thing is is that the

00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:19,970
letters c om is not a universal word

986
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:24,680
it's an abbreviation that ended up<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:28,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">a TLD so no party has hips I fact or you</font>

00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:37,880
presumably you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different words for</font>

992
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:40,270

00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:42,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">are no prior prior rights as it were</font>

998
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:53,570

999
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,780
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arabic second-level domain name</font>

1001
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:01,940
right then for a TLD the answer again is

1002
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:04,940
is no although<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you own the trademark</font>

00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:17,180
that's my understanding at Kurt do you

1008
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,580
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to add well that's</font>

1009
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:22,640
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and this is meant to</font>

1010
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:25,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">provide opportunities for people in</font>

1020
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:55,848
what's been created we hope is a very

1021

00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,740
the merits<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their applications so</font>

1024
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:05,780
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> David that can create some</font>

1039
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:48,410
staff and applicants this program is

1040
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:50,510
unleashing potentially a lot of

1041
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:52,399
potential economic value for the

1042
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:55,849
applicants and the new businesses they

1043
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,410
might create with those<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds many of</font>

1044
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:59,210
those applicants have been very

1045
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:02,420
sophisticated participants in the

1046
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:05,030
community contributing to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy</font>

1047
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:06,619
dialogue debates and drafting and that's

1048
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:08,660
what they should be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why we</font>

1049
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:10,820
call it a multi-stakeholder community

1050
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:13,160
because their stakeholders that come to

1051
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,690
the table<font color="#CCCCCC"> that changes so what I talked</font>

1052
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,890
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is is we're closing</font>

1053
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,839
one chapter on the book with the

<font color="#CCCCCC">closed that chapter and as we move into</font>

1056
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:26,598
the application processing phase we have

1057
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:32,990
to be that that process that sort of

1058
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:34,700
permeability between applicants and<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

1059
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:36,830
were potential applicants and the staff

1060
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:39,020
and many other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will need to be</font>

00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:47,680
using those terms I didn't refer to that

1065
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:50,180
that on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> site I feel we're already</font>

1066
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,759
quite well-protected we do have

1067
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,319
confidentiality agreements in place with

1075
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:15,619
and as I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my speech will be</font>

making sure that we're enforcing those
