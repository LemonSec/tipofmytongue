sector can often be a challenge there's

371
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:09,159
no shortage of commentators and critics

372

in for good measure but leaders are

374
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:17,350
important in terms of setting direction

375
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,780
and in terms of getting the right people

376
