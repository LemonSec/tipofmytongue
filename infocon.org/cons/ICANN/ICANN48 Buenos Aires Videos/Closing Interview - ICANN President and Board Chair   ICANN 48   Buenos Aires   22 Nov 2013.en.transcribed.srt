the newest channel is one net org one

we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work together moving</font>

forward in governing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet so</font>

94
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,930
that's an important initiative and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

95
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:49,280
think between now and Singapore that the

icon community is going to work to

97
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:56,539
ensure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> our voice as a community</font>

98
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:59,440
with all of its diversity is heard

99
00:04:56,539 --> 00:05:02,360
through the one net as well not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

100
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">through one net but through one net as</font>

101
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,590
well and the second area where we will

102
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,090
see between<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and the Singapore</font>

103
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:12,830
meeting significant work is to watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

104
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,659
the panel that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just announced</font>

105
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,880
recently the panel on the future of

106
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,030
Internet Governance evolves and does its

107
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,190
work by the time we meet in Singapore

108
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,289
the panel would have completed its

109
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,300
report and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be an</font>

110
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:28,900
important report for next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year's</font>

111
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:33,320
dialogue and Internet Governance because

112
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:35,948
we need some frameworks and some

113
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:39,830
blueprints that<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow us to coalesce</font>

114
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:41,960
everyone in a substantive dialogue Steve

let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me pivot over to the new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD</font>

116
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,219
program there was a lot of talking

117
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,229
during the Buenos Aires meeting about

118
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> auction process came up at</font>

119
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:53,479
the public forum<font color="#CCCCCC"> describe to me if you</font>

120
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,020
will what came at you during this

121
00:05:53,479 --> 00:06:00,229
meeting and what this issue is about

122
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:03,500
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a that's been around for a</font>

123
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:06,139
long time it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> dormant for a while</font>

124
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:12,700
and now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming back up and properly</font>

125
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:15,730
so i can will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be holding auctions which</font>

126
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:18,310
really the last resort<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> resorting</font>

127
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:21,310
contentions<font color="#E5E5E5"> over strings by competing</font>

128
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:24,130
companies that have applications for the

129
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,870
same string our preference has always

130
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,150
been that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they should sort it out among</font>

131
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:32,320
themselves and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason private</font>

132
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,929
auctions but if the parties want i can

133
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:38,440
to conduct an auction will do them

134
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:41,320
proceeds<font color="#CCCCCC"> from those auctions will be a</font>

135
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:45,400
new source of revenue new source of

136
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:47,560
funds and we have committed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've</font>

137
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,169
made the statement very strongly and

138
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">firmly and personally we have committed</font>

139
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:55,210
that we will not just absorb those funds

140
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,950
into our general operating fund we won't

141

<font color="#E5E5E5">even just generally put them into our</font>

142
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:03,700
reserve funds<font color="#E5E5E5"> will view this as an</font>

00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:06,640
entirely separate source of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

144
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,640
that it needs to be dealt with as such

145
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,320
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> leads to two things one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:26,980
question that came up we took in some
