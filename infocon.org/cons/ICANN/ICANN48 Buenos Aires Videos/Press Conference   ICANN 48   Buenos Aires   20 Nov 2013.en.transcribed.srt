1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,750
an important feature of the

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:09,750
multi-stakeholder model is listening

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:14,040
it's not a bug it's a feature we should

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,730
listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for the last the day</font>

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">yesterday I had the chance to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meet with</font>

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,039
along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with my fellow board members with</font>

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,980
every part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the i kin community we</font>

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,230
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the stakeholder meetings day and</font>

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:31,019
in all of these meetings we heard loud

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">and clear that our community</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is very</font>

11
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,170
engaged on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet governance</font>

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">subject and would very much like to</font>

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:43,680
communicate and discuss and dialogue

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,750
their views on how the icon community

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,140
will participate vigorously in that

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,149
global dialogue and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this morning we</font>

17
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,300
called for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an impromptu meeting at a</font>

18
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,879
very difficult hour at 7am especially

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">that last night our community was having</font>

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,820
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good time at our music night but</font>

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,860
everyone that I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've seen</font>

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,090
around the holes showed up we had

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:12,360
hundreds of people here and had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

24
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:19,350
good dialogue and for me personally this

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:22,560
is testament to the remarkable value of

26
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,320
the multi-stakeholder model it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,950
its essence on the first day<font color="#CCCCCC"> I called it</font>

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:32,008
the marrow of I can this ability to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,950
open to listen to dialogue to give and

30
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,950
take and to adjust our course of action

31
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,439
based on that because listening is not a

32
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,590
one-way exercise it is a two-way

33
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,419
exercise followed by action and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

34
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,270
the community will see that we're taking

35
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and putting it into action as we</font>

36
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,060
move forward there was first of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:59,880
huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of interest and the interest</font>

38
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:02,369
was spread from lots of interest in so

39
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,740
what's the process how will this work to

40
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,110
the substance issues what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going</font>

41
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,568
to talk about how what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

42
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,459
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this where what results and and</font>

43
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,859
what topics in particular are going to

44
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:18,480
be taken

45
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:23,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">up the initiative of the of this kind is</font>

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,510
very big and it it crosses<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

47
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,540
communities it touches a lot of people

48
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:31,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">and motivates everybody and then it's a</font>

49
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,000
question of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that activity taking</font>

50
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">some shape and so we're at the</font>

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
relatively early parts of that formative

52
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:42,910
process and people are in different

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,340
stages of thoughtfulness<font color="#E5E5E5"> and engagement</font>

54
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,440
and this was I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a key step within</font>

55
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,730
the i kin community of getting the

56
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,910
different segments of the i kin

57

community focused on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> upcoming</font>

issues about thinking about internet
