10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,769

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,879
airport and airline food here around my

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:47,879
waist but that will keep me<font color="#E5E5E5"> in sentence</font>

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:53,010
to keep my weight down this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

16
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:03,809
shaver here a boy somebody told you that

17
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,450
you're now going to be an adult and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

18
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,479
way I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going through this</font>

19
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,000
transformation as well that I can

20
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,429
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a community we are taking</font>

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,820
all the learnings from the last 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

22
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:24,979
and preparing ourselves for an important

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,979
future and so I'll find<font color="#E5E5E5"> my clicker here</font>

24
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:34,479
if you recall when we started we said we

25
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:38,440
have a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> season and indeed it's been a</font>

26
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,710
year a year ago I met many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you in</font>

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:44,500
Toronto and you had asked me to start

28
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:49,110
this journey with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's been</font>

29
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:52,180
quite a journey I'm an immigrant twice

30
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,970
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> because my parents moved from our</font>

31
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,159
native country to Lebanon where I ended

32
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:00,158
up having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn to live in a new land</font>

33
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,229
and then second time when I had to leave

34
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,110
as an adult to come to the United States

35
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:09,008
and learn again to integrate into a

36
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:12,400
community but now I'm an immigrant a

37
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:16,359
third time because when I arrived to

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:20,530
this community I did not know how strong

39
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,330
and deep<font color="#E5E5E5"> this community is and I was</font>

40
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,090
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> an immigrant in your</font>

41
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:28,180
community a year ago I didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

42
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">to expect but I had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the experience</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

having been through<font color="#E5E5E5"> an integration</font>

44
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:40,959

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:19,720
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> serve it well in the years ahead</font>

56
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,850
it's been a year and when we started I

57
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,020
told you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to get the ground</font>

58
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:28,269
ready I think we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> done with that face</font>

59
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:31,000
we're starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> our year two of the new</font>

60
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:34,210
season and in the second year we're

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting to see these buds coming we're</font>

62
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:42,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fruit that we will</font>

63
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:45,090
hopefully reap in the years ahead start

64
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:47,590
sprouting and what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really mean</font>

65
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,620
so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take us a little bit on</font>

66
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:55,090
a journey over the last year so we see

67
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:59,230
how far we've come together if you

68
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:02,400
recall we laid out in Toronto these four

69
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:06,190
objectives and the 16 goals under them

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,760
this was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> roadmap we've set up so we</font>

71
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:12,850
can go on this journey together in each

72
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,549
of these objectives we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found projects</font>

73
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:19,298
and we found initiatives together that

74
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:22,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">are needed to advance our program let me</font>

also be active participants in the

this is central to the multi-stakeholder

00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:23,000
operational excellence I remember

224
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:26,090
meeting some of the alumni's of the

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,810
board for a breakfast in Prague when I

226
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:31,640
was brought in to meet<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community and</font>

227
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:34,880
boy did they take me to task on

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,360
operational excellence Hagen is here he

229
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,540
was the leader of that pack telling me

230
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:47,000
focus on operational excellence I can is

231
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:49,339
not just reflected in its policy and its

232
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">commitment to its core principles but</font>

233
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:54,560
also in its ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deliver its</font>

234
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:57,410
capabilities and its services<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we did</font>

235
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,420
and that was the part that was frankly

236
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:02,480
natural to me because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

237
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:07,550
background and therefore we created a

new division the global domains division

239
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:14,209
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very important step forward in how</font>

240
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,400
we deliver our capabilities and by the

241
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:19,120
way this was I didn't come to I can

242
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:22,310
thinking oh we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a division</font>

243
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,830
some of our community members were

criticizing me one of you here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

245
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:33,470
room wrote a tough blog about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can call</font>

Janice fast he said because it's hard

249
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:42,530
you have on one side this global domains

250
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,569
division and on one side you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do</font>

251
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:48,790
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things purely bottom-up and</font>

if you recall we came up with this idea

that we shouldn't have one headquarters

357

I can is global we should have three

358

is about all of us understanding the

internationalization not by sitting in

00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:54,970
my office in LA the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the four</font>

473
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:58,629
objectives was to evolve our

474
00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:02,980
multi-stakeholder model and this is an

475
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:05,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">area that is much more delicate because</font>

476
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:09,010
we love our multi-stakeholder model and

477
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:12,370
it is probably maybe the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sophisticated multi stick governance</font>

479
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:19,449
model that man has created it's the most

480
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:22,480
complex one as well the fear we have is

481
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:24,940
for that model to end up being not fully

482
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,280
inclusive we need to bring more people

483
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:31,270
to it so it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> become a model that</font>

484
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:34,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">is comfortable for a few the legitimacy</font>

485
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:37,270
of ICANN is in the ability of everyone

to participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that model we lose</font>

487
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:44,760
that we lose our legitimacy and so we

488
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:47,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">started a project called I can labs</font>

509
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:40,600
we have developed now a number of

510
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:43,900
excellent applications based on your

511
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:47,050
specifications and they will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of</font>

the new I can website which we will

00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:53,040
unveil in Singapore I had to preview and

514
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:57,970
it's fantastic because it's a website

515
00:26:53,040 --> 00:27:00,159
built around you not<font color="#E5E5E5"> around us it's</font>

built around the needs of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community</font>

517
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:06,220
and it has some very powerful engagement

518
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:09,100
and new applications to enable all of us

519
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:14,470
to participate so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see it in</font>

520

00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:30,850
important recommendations I must tell

you when i arrived at<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i had very</font>

526
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:35,590
little understanding of this a TR t

527
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,020
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i knew there's a lot of activity</font>

528
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:40,629
going and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got a couple of calls</font>

529
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,190
from many from people here in this room

530
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:44,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they said you have to pay attention</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to this this is what gives you also</font>

532
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,940
legitimacy you have to understand what's

533
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:53,890
behind this and then when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

534
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:56,110
it we were rushed to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying more</font>

535
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:59,500
resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> and attention to the core of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to tell you that during my first summer</font>

538
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:08,410
at I can this was my number one focus

539
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:10,780
and we got all the ATR t1

540
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:13,900
recommendations completed as we promised

541
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:16,810
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the year then we started</font>

542
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,080
the ATR t2 effort and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we have their</font>

543
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:20,539
12 recommendations

544
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> assure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that no one needs</font>

546
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:28,610
anymore I know what it is and it's on

547
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:30,500
the top of my priority and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12</font>

548
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:35,889
recommendations which I think by the way

549
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:38,779
pack some incredibly important evolution

550
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:40,580
recommendations for us i will pay

551
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:42,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention to them my team will pay</font>

552
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:44,299
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them but more importantly</font>

553
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,909
all of us should pay attention to them

554
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:49,730
because if we implement them<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can will</font>

555
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:54,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a better and more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> legitimate</font>

growth numbers you can see for<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself</font>

558

575
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:51,380
together and build solutions and the

same applies to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> strategy panels many</font>

00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:02,840
thought that comes together and produces

580
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:05,809
hopefully some input not output they

581
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,240
produce input to the community so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:49,660
with an educational institution and with

partnered with us so we ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

panel has some level of independency n

646
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:07,860
is functioning on a broader scale

647
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,830
globally so we welcome all five panels

648
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:14,530
they do not usurp who we are they

649
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:16,689
enhance who we are they inform us they

650
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:21,010
give us more input and we thank them<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

651
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:23,080
the great work they're putting so this

652
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:25,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">is our model that all of you know and</font>

653
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,240
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> model will survive with us in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

654
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:30,179
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the year after that</font>

655
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:34,240
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still to be done</font>

656
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:36,100
so i'm going to share with you now what

657
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,650
I think we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done better on</font>

658
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:43,870
this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last year I have not</font>

659
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:47,500
achieved my goal in the area of

660
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:50,260
measurements I wanted a deeper set of

661
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,780
measurements on our success many of you

662
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:55,960
who come from an operational background

663
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:59,290
know how important metrics are we're not

664
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:02,110
done we have more work to do but<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the</font>

665
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:06,129
time we meet next year we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have had</font>

666
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:08,859
a living set of metrics that allow us to

667
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:11,440
track every area of this model across I

668
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:13,840
can we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beginnings of the model</font>

669
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,990
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it didn't advance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as I wished</font>

670
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:19,060
so once it's ready and I hope sooner

671
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:21,790
than later i will share it with you and

672
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:24,250
it will be our scorecard it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow</font>

673
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:27,699
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see how we're managing in a very</font>

674
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:31,060
precise way another<font color="#E5E5E5"> area we didn't do</font>

675
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:33,580
very well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think last year is cost</font>

676
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,469
controls and this is why I'm putting a

677
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,840
lot more emphasis on cost control this

678
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:40,509
here this doesn't mean we plan to reduce

679
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,929
our services and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the quality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what we</font>

680
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:47,200
do but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> means when we grow from 125</font>

681
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:49,899
people by next June to probably 300

682
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:52,629
people and our expenditures grow it

683
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:53,359
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to put in place cost</font>

684
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:55,670
controls

685
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,920
this is very important this is an area

686
00:34:55,670 --> 00:35:01,430
where I promise you next year we will do

687
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,680
better the third area where I don't

688
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:07,970
think we did as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we hoped is the</font>

689
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,399
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself notwithstanding my I can</font>

690
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:13,100
we did some few things to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make the</font>

691
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,560
website better but our team is very hard

692
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:19,069
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> work to completely change the</font>

693
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:21,529
experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ICANN org and we are doing</font>

694
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:23,420
it in consultation with the community

695
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:26,150
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a lot of feedback through</font>

696
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:28,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can labs and I promise you that by</font>

697
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:33,290
Singapore we will have a whole new

698
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:36,350
experience at<font color="#CCCCCC"> icon org lastly the fourth</font>

699
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:40,700
area we didn't do very well at is the

700
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:43,400
area I promised<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break the silos when</font>

701
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:46,419
I arrived at I can it was very quickly

702
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:49,610
obvious to me we have a lot of silos

703
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:52,640
there were silos within my team within

704
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:55,550
the staff people were not coordinated

705
00:35:52,640 --> 00:36:01,160
were not integrated there were silos

706
00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:03,710
between the staff and the board<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we</font>

707
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:08,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">have addressed today within the I</font>

708
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:11,240
canteen staff there are no Silas and we

709
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:13,490
did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just by telling them talk</font>

710
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,790
to each other but by creating for the

711
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:19,220
first time a cross-departmental project

712
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:22,580
management tool that allowed projects to

713
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:25,189
be worked at horizontally not vertically

714
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:28,549
across all of I can and this tool is

715
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:31,100
working and driving our activities with

716
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:32,780
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board we broke all the walls between</font>

00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:37,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the staff and the board and there were</font>

718
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:39,560
many when I first<font color="#E5E5E5"> started the board had</font>

719
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:41,630
a meeting in LA and I asked the board if

720
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:45,110
we could have our first lunch with the

721
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:47,270
whole staff and we started mingling and

722
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:49,190
staff members were asking me can we talk

723
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:50,930
to the board members yes you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font>

724
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,520
the board members can can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange</font>

725
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:55,910
ideas with them yes of course you can

726
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:59,240
exchange ideas with them this is how

727
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:02,529
difficult it was today we are completely

728
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:05,180
open and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to go</font>

729
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:06,210
transparency<font color="#CCCCCC"> and openness to break the</font>

730
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,040
silos is

731
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:11,670
how we need to move forward some of you

732
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:14,190
may have seen that at some of the input

733
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:16,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got from the community I moved my</font>

own office at this I can meeting to the

735
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:22,109
hall it's completely open you can come

736
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:23,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">and visit me anytime but if I'm Anna</font>

737
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:27,200
meeting allow me to just finish the

738
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:29,730
meeting but my office is outside

739
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,848
complete transparency this is something

740
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:35,160
I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn and continue to learn</font>

741
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:36,900
because that's the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> way in the icon</font>

742
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:40,830
community in this multi-stakeholder

743
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:44,670
community I must tell you that as I look

744
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:46,440
forward to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next year I have two</font>

745
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:52,410
things I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to tell you about next</font>

746
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:55,500
year the first is that I understand that

747
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:58,589
the marrow of ICANN is our

748
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:02,280
multi-stakeholder nature that's our

749
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:06,080
marrow and if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't live in that</font>

750
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:11,369
narrow with you then we don't get there

751
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:13,680
you have my commitment sometimes it

752
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:17,550
appears that I'm not as committed to

753
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:20,240
that model but believe me the<font color="#CCCCCC"> energy the</font>

754
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:23,970
enthusiasm that I have is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

755
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:26,399
it's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that model it's not</font>

756
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:28,649
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I want to achieve it is</font>

757
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,369
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you have invited us all</font>

758
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:34,680
of us to do together that's my

759
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:37,710
commitment to you that's the marrow I

760
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:40,140
will not forget and I learn as I go I

761
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:42,150
learn and sometimes I speak my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind as I</font>

762
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">learn and those of you who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know me</font>

763
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:46,580
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that he's changing his mind I</font>

764
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:49,080
just speak my mind as I go forward

765
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:51,450
that's my style and forgive me for it

766
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,369
but it's the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> way for me to be</font>

767
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:56,009
completely transparent and to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:57,570
what I know and what I don't know one of

<font color="#CCCCCC">you sitting here in the front hit me</font>

770
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:01,140

773
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:09,000

817
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,930
all listening together we should figure

818
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:18,330
out the year ahead so that elephant

819
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:22,500
should go<font color="#CCCCCC"> away and instead it should be</font>

820
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:25,710
our cause today I wish to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you that</font>

821
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:28,930
why we moved on this area<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the last</font>

00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:31,990
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> months is to protect I can</font>

823
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:36,779
I can was under pressure to increase

824
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:40,240
what it does to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> its remit larger</font>

825
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:42,790
icons model of multi stakeholders was

826
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,009
under pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the Snowden</font>

827
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:47,200
revelations didn't help because they

828
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:51,460
pushed more people to say we need

829
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:54,359
governments to govern the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet we</font>

830
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:57,579
need to stand up for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our model and</font>

831
00:41:54,359 --> 00:42:00,430
therefore what we did together with you

832
00:41:57,579 --> 00:42:02,559
I star leaders was to energize the

833
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:04,660
process we didn't invent anything new

834
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:07,990
you've been working on this for<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

835
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:10,720
all we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> was to energize the process</font>

836
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:13,629
and the energizing of the process is

837
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:17,799
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lead us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all to work together so</font>

838
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:20,440
