1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,640
you gentlemen were in the meeting

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,369
yesterday where they were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,349
the name collision issue basically bring

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,450
us up to speed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Jeff where are we</font>

5
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:13,789
now on that issue sure so the issue

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,160
first surfaced a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago it's</font>

7
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:18,320
been looked at energetically now for

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,849
about the last six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months i can has</font>

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,939
commissioned a couple studies to look

10
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:25,880
into the frequency of collisions and to

11
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:28,999
better understand the issue the emergent

12
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,549
strategy has involved a block list

13
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:33,350
approach which allows registries to go

14
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,600
live most registries to go live

15
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">immediately if they block a list of</font>

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">names that were queried in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dental</font>

18
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,200
temporary approach then my company<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

19
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,810
been engaged to for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term</font>

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">approach of the permanent approach which</font>

21
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">is two more carefully research the issue</font>

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,770
understand the consequences as well as

23
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:57,650
the different modalities of why these

24
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:01,370
collisions are occurring and to produce

25
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:04,670
a report that will give registries the

26
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,740
the path to full deployment getting out

27
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,320
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> block list approach managing down</font>

28
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,630
the risk of of damage through these

29
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,479
collisions Mikey you followed this issue

30
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,830
for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> time what's your reaction to</font>

31
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,560
what you heard yesterday how did you

32
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,840
feel well yes I have followed<font color="#CCCCCC"> this issue</font>

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,580
for quite a while and in fact I'm one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

34
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,270
the folks who sort of mobilized and

35
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,740
alerted people to this issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for</font>

36
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,710
quite some time we've been concerned

37
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:33,408
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their dramatic impossible dramatic</font>

38
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:37,100
impacts on businesses connectivity

39
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:39,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">providers network operators my concern</font>

40
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:43,399
was reaching the level of fearfulness

41
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:46,039
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yesterday its meeting was really</font>

42
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,260
helpful for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I started to see</font>

43
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,270
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really like i like the</font>

44
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,979
projects<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Jeff is working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on but</font>

45
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,259
some of the other projects as well that

46
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:57,229
are being proposed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICANN security</font>

47
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,180
staff so I found yesterday's meeting

48
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:01,729
very helpful am I keep moving forward

49
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,320
what would you like to see happen well

50
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:05,270
I'd like to lobby Jeff a little bit

51
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,619
because he's in the project team and say

52
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,378
that there are really two things that

53
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:11,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'd love to see one is that yesterday we</font>

54
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:13,120
heard about several<font color="#E5E5E5"> different projects</font>

55
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:15,069
that are essentially being run<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,629
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> with each other I think it would</font>

57
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,790
be lovely if there could be a

58
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:21,040
coordinated management approach to those

59
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,739
projects partly because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it would</font>

60
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,079
make them more effective and partly

61
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:28,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it plays into the second</font>

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,519
thing that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would love to see which is</font>

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the formation of a community-based group</font>

64
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,440
that represents some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the folks who</font>

65
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:40,328
may be impacted on this so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we not</font>

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,940
no power no<font color="#E5E5E5"> authority but we could</font>

67
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:46,660
provide guidance on a very short

68
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:48,730
turnaround time and then give you

69
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,430
direction and the rest of the project

70
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">team members</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> directing that that can</font>

71
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,079
keep you on course those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the two</font>

72
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,069
thousand and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff mikey is one voice</font>

73
00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:01,690
after after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the panel what came at you</font>

74
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:04,030
from other voices for people generally

75
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,370
acknowledging the fact that this issue

76
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,810
is now being addressed and are the are

77
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,390
the challenges<font color="#E5E5E5"> that came at you or the</font>

78
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,920
questions how we proceed forward or what

79
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,809
were you hearing following the session

80
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,000
so the the general feedback that I've

81
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,090
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting is no this is an important</font>

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue it's a serious issue and people</font>

83
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,709
are appreciative of the fact that it is

84
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,010
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> serious attention reason</font>

85
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:29,470
detention in my key deer point you know

86
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:32,590
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on this project</font>

87
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,599
so you know i can has several proactive

88
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,870
you know outreach so you know sorts of

89
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,760
efforts there's our project there's the

90
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,310
temporary approach there's the

91
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,090
implementation you know of the the /

92
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,530
registry plans later next year so i'm

93
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,560
with you i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know good</font>

94
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,730
community visibility good coordination

95
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,829
so the people are aware of all the

96
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that are going on that the</font>

97
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:57,860
comprehensiveness of the approach and

98
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,000
people are aware and

99
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,530
and didn't feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this good</font>

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">visibility into this issue it sounds</font>

101
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,500
like you're both sinking on one thing

102
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,880
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all about basically what</font>

103
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,350
happened yesterday it's about open lines

104
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,180
of communication you<font color="#E5E5E5"> being able to</font>

105
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">express your concerns and moving forward</font>

106
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,770
with this cooperative sort of approach

107
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,750
here's how we do we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk and</font>

108
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,430
work this out yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one of</font>

109
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that's going on that I find</font>

110
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,769
really positive is taking the message

111
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:26,210
and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even a message thing it's</font>

112
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:29,330
taking the attention away from the dire

113
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,770
possible outcomes which we need to

114
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,270
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> better and that's what your</font>

115
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,930
studies going to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> us with which is</font>

116
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:39,169
great but in a way there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that</font>

117
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:42,230
we can ever know and we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus on</font>

118
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:45,229
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do and what we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do can</font>

119
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:48,700
vary substantially help network

120
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:51,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">operators ISPs business owners people</font>

121
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:55,219
address the possible collisions that

122
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:59,419
will occur quickly effectively without

123
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:02,479
undue disruption to their their systems

124
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:07,070
and liners less of a sky is falling sort

125
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,900
of concern and more of a what's the risk

126
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,729
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with it how do we move</font>

127
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">forward so it's not unlike any other</font>

128
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:15,830
risk management approach so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage</font>

129
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,320
down the risk to an acceptable level

130
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:20,150
right understand it<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand your</font>

131
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,010
consequences frequencies and then you

132
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,239
invest the rest in response so you know

133
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,640
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> never going to drive risk to zero</font>

134
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,620
in anything we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

135
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,390
comprehensive approach and I think that

136
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,040
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this program in its</font>

137
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,169
totality will do that it struck me

138
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,820
sitting as merely an observer in

139
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:36,409
yesterday's session that this was the

140
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">system working this was everything</font>

141
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,950
coming together<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it should I think</font>

142
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's right i think one of the things</font>

143
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:45,530
that's made it very hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> this last year</font>

144
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:47,720
is the sort of innate tension between

145
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:50,960
the need to get that new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld program</font>

146
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,840
out the door and the needs of folks who

147
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,810
are impacted by<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and i find this</font>

148
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,128
