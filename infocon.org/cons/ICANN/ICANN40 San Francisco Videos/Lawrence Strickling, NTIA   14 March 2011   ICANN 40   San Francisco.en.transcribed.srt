because multi stakeholder organizations

review team asked the board to provide a

294
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,260
status report on our recommendations at

295
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,850
this week's meeting and everyone in the

is whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments collectively can</font>
