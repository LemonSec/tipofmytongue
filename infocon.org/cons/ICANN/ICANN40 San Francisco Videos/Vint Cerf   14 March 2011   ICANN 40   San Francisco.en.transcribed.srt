pleasure to come back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see so many</font>

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,180
I appreciate very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much your undertaking</font>

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,910
the task of leading this organization

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,390
further into the future I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,920
respond momentarily to something two

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:37,430
John pastels responsibility as the I

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:41,399
Amma actually started much much earlier

14
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:43,879
he was first the numbers are starting in

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:47,700
nineteen sixty-nine when the ARPANET was

16
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:51,329
underway and Steve Crocker issued the

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,219
first request for comment John undertook

18
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,960
to keep track of a lot of the protocol

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,480
parameters and the allocations of

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,539
address space back then and then as time

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,979
went on as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet tcp/ip protocols</font>

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:07,020
were used he expanded that role so he

23
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,439
had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a function like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this for</font>

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,060
a good fraction of his career the other

25
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,889
observation I appreciate very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much your</font>

26
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,350
comments but I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you that</font>

27
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,720
remind you anyway that Esther Dyson was

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,000
the first chairman of I can and

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:27,090
undertook that role because nobody else

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,329
would and she was an impressive act to

31
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,549
follow as I assumed the role in two

32
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:36,029
thousand and second Mike Roberts of

33
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,040
course acted as the first CEO I did have

34
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,450
the pleasure of participating in the

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:45,869
inaugural meeting of the board at which

36
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:48,329
Esther was elected and mike roberts was

37
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,979
confirmed as CEO<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was not a member of</font>

38
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> board at that time I was simply a</font>

39
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:56,219
visitor finally I'd wanted making an

40
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,908
observation generic generic observation

41
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,559
about why the internet and all the

42
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:04,469
institutions surrounding it have managed

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,429
to function as despite all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the storm and</font>

44
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,780
wrong I think it's because they're very

45
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,120
loosely coupled

46
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,420
this entire system is designed around

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,610
relatively loose coupling and

48
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:20,700
standardization<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if we're it not for</font>

49
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,069
that I think it would easily be too

50
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,859
brittle to survive so this loose

51
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,569
coupling of organizations and networks

52
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,090
and protocols and everything else is

53
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:33,720
really has given it a longevity that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

54
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:37,319
couldn't otherwise have ihe represent

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:10,760
that was the ARPANET project starting in

65
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,410
nineteen sixty eight but as time went on

66
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,690
responsibility for this system devolved

67
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,510
from DARPA to the defense communications

68
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,400

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the National Science Foundation and</font>

78

and into the private sector you can see

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,690
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this evidence in the</font>

procurement contract for the iono

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,450
function and a memorandum of

understanding the procurement contract

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,290
still exists the memorandum of

affirmation of commitments that evolved

out of the interactions of ICANN the

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,040

99
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,840
morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I know we have a lot to do</font>

100
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:44,229
but I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to offer a few thoughts</font>

101
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,500
that come to mind about the immediate

102
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:50,260
future there exists as you know a

103
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:54,130
procurement contract and I believe that

104
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:57,760
that concept of procuring service from I

105
00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:00,490
can really ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change to become a</font>

106
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,760
cooperative agreement because I believe

107
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,400
that format expresses more correctly the

108
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,560
relationship between I can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

109
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,349
Department of Commerce I still think

110
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">that such an agreement is useful and</font>

111
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,130
therefore would not resist it but I

112
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:19,330
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a procurement contract is</font>

113
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:21,690
an overly rigid structure for it through

114
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:25,690
which to express the relationship

115
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:27,969
between the Department of Commerce and I

116
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:31,810
came the second thing I want to remind

117
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:34,510
you of is an RFC 2860 which is dated

118

their own and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can that RFC</font>

122

Norwich tenth of the year 2000 and it

127
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,789
concerns the delegation of

00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:08,169

00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,120
serve as well if you're going to do

157
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,030
contributed greatly to the

158
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,490
interoperability that's been the

159
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,169
hallmark of internets design from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

160
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:36,640
earliest stages and I think it's a very

161
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:39,790
wise philosophy to follow we can see

162
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,849
occasions where parties might decide

163
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:45,280
that for a variety of reasons that<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

164
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,230
standards might be a good idea generally

165
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,940
speaking that leads to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the possibility</font>

166
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,650
that parties will pick the opposite

standard and not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to endure work</font>

168
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:56,469
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would strongly urge that you think</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">about that as you put policies together</font>

170
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:03,100
I want to echo something that iris said

171
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:06,100
which i believe is very important to the

172

increase transparency of and to explain

the rationale for policy decisions

175
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,900
arising out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can process</font>

particularly out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of any board</font>

182
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,429

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,929
of transparency helps as<font color="#CCCCCC"> IRA points out</font>

in cases where there is disagreement

with a conclusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least one can</font>
