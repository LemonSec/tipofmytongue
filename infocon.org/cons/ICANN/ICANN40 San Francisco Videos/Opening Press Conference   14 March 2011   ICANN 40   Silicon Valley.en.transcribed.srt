questions every speaker this morning

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,650
hammered home the same thought and that

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that the multi-stakeholder model is</font>

13
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,209
fundamental<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the Internet's future and</font>

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that model is working more people are</font>

17
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,910
of that this is the largest meeting in

<font color="#CCCCCC">ICANN's history and this multi</font>

19
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:45,000
stakeholder participation is critical to

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,800
the Internet's continued success that

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,750
sends a powerful signal that the

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,910
multi-stakeholder model is not only

23
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,269
alive but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's thriving and it's</font>

24
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,459

perspective when he said the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is</font>

27
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:04,438

it's my belief or who wouldn't have

48
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,820
stated it so I mean I think it's that's

49
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,798
the view<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this community and we think</font>

what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to talk about the</font>

51
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,520
long-term evolution of the Internet of

52
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,829
the governance structures I say the

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,469
internet was born as a one hundred

54
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,939
percent US government creation it was

55
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,060
specifically a Department of Defense

56
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:12,690
classified project that was its birth in

57
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,380
a late 60s it is evolving to becoming a

58
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,359
hundred

59
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,540
global and I think that's well it'll

illustrated by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andrew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> McLaughlin's</font>

00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,880
hundred percent global it's not there

67
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,829
there's still a skewed distribution the

68
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,190
governance structures of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font>

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,470
including I can but also others are

70
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,120
evolving along the curve behind the

71
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,250
actual spread of the network and the

72
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,200
devices in my view and so I think

73
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term arc towards the</font>

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,670
ecosystem bodies becoming entirely

75
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:56,070
global and I think that that visionary

76
00:02:53,670 --> 00:03:00,619
statement that was embodied in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the green</font>

77
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:03,329

aspirations for us to have in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the long</font>

making<font color="#CCCCCC"> progress along that as we pass</font>

81
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,010
each key milestone such as the current

82
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,370
iono evolution we have a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

85
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,430
living up to its mandate after his

00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,930
comments this morning what will be

87
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,090
discussed<font color="#E5E5E5"> this week do you feel</font>

confident that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will address the</font>

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,440
Department of Commerce's concerns let me

90
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,600
style that fit well<font color="#E5E5E5"> we welcome that kind</font>

91
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,220
of criticism as Larry Strickling said in

92
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,049
his very good speech I thought this

93
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,670
morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> we we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never be afraid of</font>

94
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,340
Frank and<font color="#E5E5E5"> robust discussion and that</font>

95
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,470
includes frequent and regular reviews of

96
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,030
the way we're performing and he took

97
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,010
part and put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of effort into</font>

98
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,290
his participation in the accountability

99
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,730
and transparency review team itself and

100
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">as he said they gave him an opportunity</font>

101
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,230
to do a deep dive into some of these

102
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,550
some of these aspects and so the

103
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:59,060
transparency review team recommendations

104
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:02,280
are there for the board to consider

105
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:05,459
we're doing that and as he said as Radha

106
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,990
said his response in part the board is

107
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,630
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at this meeting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and has</font>

108
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,550
to have a full<font color="#CCCCCC"> program sorted out by</font>

109
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">June so I think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is we're well</font>

110

on track to dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 80 RT</font>

111
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,420
recommendations Peter bottom line how

112
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:22,280
likely is it that the board will vote

113
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:24,890
open up new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld applications on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday</font>

114
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,609
well I think we've already given the

115
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,270
government advisory committee the

116
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,680
commitment that we

117
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,599
might be launching the program here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

118
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,639
San Francisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is</font>

119
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:35,069
moving that program forward through a

<font color="#E5E5E5">great deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of consultation with the</font>

123
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,930
us in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carter haina so the real exercise</font>

124
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,490
is to try and work as hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we can</font>

that we will see in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this meeting is to</font>

132
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,750
the government advisory committee has

about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> etc um how do you feel about</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money and security and I Robbie was a</font>

want gia diversity and it's important to

144
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,349
to go to all of these peoples but maybe

145
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,448
should I can decide just to have the

146
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:37,139
meetings in international herbs or I'm

147
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:39,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">just pondering on the thought sure first</font>

148
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,789
yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people were</font>

149
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,349
disappointed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were not able to or</font>

150
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:45,509
chose not to do the event in Jordan and

151
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:47,819
June I'm certainly disappointed in the

152
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:49,229
board I love Jordan has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> country I've</font>

153
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:51,270
been there many times I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have many dear</font>

154
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:55,318
friends in the country and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was really</font>

155
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:57,508
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it it was very simply</font>

156
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,409
a primary logistical questions that came

157
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:00,870
up we were concerned about

158
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:02,789
transportation in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the region and just</font>

159
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,409
there were geopolitical developments in

160
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:06,930
the region far outside of our control

161
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:09,360
and we did hear concerns from community

162
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,490
members<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we thought if we're going to</font>

163
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,169
consider changing the venue let's do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

164
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,389
early so that people can make

165
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:19,340
appropriate plans once and not have to

166
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:21,990
change it so we discuss that with the

167
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">hosts in Jordan they were disappointed</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">but I think they understood and we're</font>

172
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:37,620
with respect to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> philosophy of having</font>

173
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,719
meetings and you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> personally was</font>

174
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,540
involved in massive efforts to keep

Nairobi

176
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,470
on track and in personally getting

177
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:47,010
engaged to make sure that we were taking

178
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,090
additional security measures to address

179
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:51,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">community members concerns and</font>

180
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,940
additional measures to be as transparent

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,260
and accountable as possible about any

182
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,510
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we received concerned</font>

183
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,740
concerning risks and threats and we

184
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,960
pulled the event off<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

185
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,480
successful<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're very grateful for</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that very grateful to the Kenyans our</font>

00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,430
philosophy is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to do</font>

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,380
meetings all around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world in regions</font>

189
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,850
and developing countries<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more</font>

190
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,340
developed countries but the Internet's

191
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,710
everywhere what we do have to have is

192
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,260
the logistical framework to pull off

193
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,930
these rather large meetings with a lot

194
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,330
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> small meeting rooms and components</font>

195
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,890
and you know a range of hotel prices in

196
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,409
qualities that there's there's a broad

197
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:32,289
set of factors and as the meetings get

198
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,600
larger unfortunately that<font color="#CCCCCC"> does make it a</font>

199
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,730
bit more difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to some cities</font>

200
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,040
that may not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same hotel in</font>

00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:43,090
conference infrastructure that others do

202
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:45,010
but we certainly would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to consider</font>

203
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,080
Jordan as a site in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future if</font>

204
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:49,870
they're willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to host again and we</font>

00:07:54,370 --> 00:08:01,150
given appropriate support from the local

industry and government does I can have

210
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:07,030
any contingency for people who have

no<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean no we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we're not able to</font>

actually won the assistant secretary

245
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,010
spoke about oh no it was a mentor who

246
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:27,400
spoke about the cooperative agreement

247
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:31,420
instead of a procurement procedures that

248
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,939
might be possible for the future how

249
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,310
could that look like from your point of

250
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,340
view and the second one the assistant

251

secretary secretary spoke about

252
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:46,630
consensus<font color="#E5E5E5"> rule so try to get consensus</font>

253
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:49,750
and only then act as a board so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

254
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:52,000
consensus is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not possible as we have</font>

seen it for years with a new TLD<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

what can you do them and a very small

257
00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:00,100
administrative thing I asked in by email

258
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,320
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> why are the open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jack sessions</font>

259
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:06,400
not strained anymore so the constituency

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,010
back meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'll take the first</font>

261
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,590
question there Monica gutentag and then

262
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:14,680
I'll let Peter help answer the the

263
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:17,890
others with respect to a cooperative

264
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,109
agreement one of the advantages of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

265
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,330
type of structure is that it can be of a

266
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer term duration than a procurement</font>

267
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:28,600
contract which which has typically a

268
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:30,610
shorter duration and and I'm not the if

269
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,440
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> more deep legal and political</font>

270
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,510
insight I have Jamie headland here is

271

273
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,870
very specific differences but a

cooperative agreement for example is

275
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:46,870
used between<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA and bear assignment</font>

276
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:49,210
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply feel it's a more</font>

277
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:52,720

292
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,980
that's providing a service and a

293
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,650
cooperative agreement seems more

294
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,770
befitting of the type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship</font>

295
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:33,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia have developed and</font>

296
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,150
again if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to drill deeper I'm</font>

297
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,310
happy to hand it over to Jamie but right

298
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,110
now I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hand it over to Peter to</font>

299
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,000
address the latter part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your first</font>

300
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,740
question on consensus on the board and

301
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,590
then the second question regarding the

302
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">gac consultations yes the issue really</font>

303
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:50,370
there is what happens as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Miller Monica</font>

304
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,260
as I understand your question that's

305
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,000
really picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the point that Larry</font>

306
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,250
said that we should strive as always for

307
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,180
consensus and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board steps and</font>

308
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,020
that has the capacity to destabilize the

309
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,810
multi-stakeholder model we've course

310
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,550
agree with that I particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree</font>

311
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,439
with that and helped draft the CC NSA

312
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,630
bylaws for example under which the board

313
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,480
cannot do that so recommendations coming

314
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:15,420
through from the CC NSO the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

315
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,580
able to remake those that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to</font>

316
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,610
disagree as it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remind them to the</font>

317
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:23,910
CC NSA so the principles deep if you

318
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:26,270
like in the bylaws of I can the

319
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:29,670
difficulty of courses as always the

320
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:31,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">practicalities and the recent example</font>

321
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:35,490
involves an issue where the gns ocala

324

328
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:51,660
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a consequence in some cases</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where that policy is</font>

that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually balanced between</font>

structural problem and the borders and

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,180
my view<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the appropriate body to</font>

fact a deadlock as we reached on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

354
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:42,510
particular case so yes as a matter of

00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,790
principle we strongly supported on very

356
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:48,240
rare occasions we find the board has to

step<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an act I'm Joe man with the</font>

of from a from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level view how do</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you see I can working on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those issues</font>

366
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:18,029
one of the reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> I encourage</font>

367
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:20,910
additional law enforcement to come and

00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:24,029
attend our policy work this week in

369
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:26,310
today's session and onward is to get law

370
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:28,589
enforcement more engaged in I can policy

371
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,239
development so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're helping to</font>

372
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:32,399
shape the kind of policies they want to

373
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,769
see as opposed just<font color="#E5E5E5"> being downstream</font>

374
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,089
consumers because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that law</font>

375
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:38,190
enforcement has a lot of legitimate

376
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:39,420
concerns and I have a background I've

377
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,440
worked in law enforcement for a while

378
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,050
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the Department of Homeland</font>

379
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,500

380
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:48,269
concerns at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there there</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">are other civil rights</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and liberties</font>

rights the reality is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ICANN</font>

policies today do allow for proxies<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

385
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:01,859
and it's allowed in the policies there

386
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:04,050
are different initiatives underway I can

387
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,630
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> evolution of different who is</font>

388
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:08,550
policies in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's discussion</font>

389
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,290
about what's called the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raa agreement</font>

390
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,519
the agreement that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can has with</font>

391
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:16,170
registrar's which may also add

392
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,690
additional who is requirements and

393
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,630
that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very touchy and sensitive part</font>

394
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,069
of the negotiations amongst the parties

395
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,860
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups that are involved in that</font>

396
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:29,189
contract negotiation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

397
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">an example of where there are different</font>

398
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,150
stakeholders that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different views</font>

399
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,250
and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to seek</font>

400
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:37,140
to enrich the stakeholder processes so

401
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,990
all the voices come together and that

402
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:44,060
they work together on consensus policies

403
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:45,900
and processes for the board to consider

404
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,640
recently that there's been a lot of

405
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,939
criticism including in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mainstream</font>

406
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,319
media of the board so the Washington

407
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,600
Post headline was a bummer

408
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,580
administration joins critics of us

409
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,820
nonprofit group that oversees internet

410
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,500
and then at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> recent meetings with</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">governments in Brussels you Peter self</font>

412
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,040
by dismissing those account saying

413
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,260
despite some indications in some of the

414
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,390
media this is not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be an</font>

415
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,819
adversarial session but by all accounts

416
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:13,710
that's what the meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> became and</font>

00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,990
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more several governments were</font>

00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:17,760
quite blunt in their belief<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

board was not taken the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GAC seriously</font>

420
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,140
and on top of that several well

421
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:25,500
respected community members and just now

422
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:27,240
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US Commerce Secretary publicly</font>

423
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,310
raising their concern that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

424
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,350
actually listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people but simply</font>

425
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:33,930
dismissing genuine concerns under this

426
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,120
cover of community views and sort of

427
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,739
blustering ahead even<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the extent that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're pushing the US government on on</font>

00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,720
well there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff tied up and</font>

their carers<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there there's first of</font>

all you're quoting from some headlines

which wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> Annie and adopted by the</font>

438
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:06,020
GAC itself so something that the u.s.

00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,280
was pushing forward wasn't taken up by

440
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,930
by the GAC and that was the there was

441

the idea that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. itself was</font>

floating much to most people surprised

443
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:17,130
as that individual country should have a

00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:21,320
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very productive that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the tone was</font>

475
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,000
very productive that the exchanges were

476
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,710
very helpful they were courteous and

477
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,290
that we've moved those issues

478
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:29,300
substantially forward we as a matter of

479
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,889
detail we've taken a third now of the

480
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,270
GAC advice and made it quite clear that

481
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,580
we agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that completely and we'll</font>

482
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:37,070
be implementing that that's the 1 a's in

483
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,330
our rating system another third we've

484
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,889
agreed with the principal and need to

485
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">work on the implementation that's the 1</font>

486
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:45,710
b's and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like we're down to a</font>

487
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:46,970
third of the issues now as being where

488
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,640
we've indicated we're not going to be

489

able to accept the advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and given</font>

490
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,780
reasons for that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,460
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been very very productive I</font>

492
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's fairly clear that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

493
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,670
listening and that the GAC has come to

494
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,460
this meeting really<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ready to continue</font>

495
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:03,200
the process and we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> invited the GAC to</font>

496
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,360
participate with us this afternoon in

497
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,700
more community consultation so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

498
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,620
there can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more exchanges and more</font>

499
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,230
listening so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we I think the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">record on that speaks for itself I just</font>

501
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:16,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to share I've heard a lot of very</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of the gang following the consultations</font>

spans the spectrum or the rainbow as you

discussing protocol changes with

in the world that might be registering

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,940
for new gTLDs so we chose not to do an

parties out there that have taken stabs

and estimates and you need to find their

their resources online if you want any

actually listening to people or

566
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,409
dismissing their concerns so you said

578
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:14,060
in these discussions so

579
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,950
my point was that there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

580
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,960
strong language particularly for

581
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,910
governments coming out in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> say no</font>

582
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,640
it's fine they're happy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there what</font>

583
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,660
they're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we aren't happy I'm</font>

584
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">not sure that's a question that's a</font>

585
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,400
statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your view of the your</font>

586
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,950
perception of the consultations no I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

587
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,600
directly quote them<font color="#CCCCCC"> Norway says we feel</font>

588
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,760
you are not taking the government side

589
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,550
seriously and the US says we need some

590
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,470
actual demonstrable credible evidence

591
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:41,030
that when the gac provides advice i can

592
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:44,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">has seemed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be accepting that advice</font>

593
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:45,860
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my word it's their word what</font>

594
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,540
I suggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you ask those people</font>

595
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,639
and I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to comment again about</font>

596
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,080
what individual people have said talk to

597
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">those people about their view about the</font>

598
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,129
consultation and I'm sure you'll find

599
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,270
that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are that they are feeling that</font>

600
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the productive efforts have been made</font>

601
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:00,230
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've moved forward on these</font>

602
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,610
issues the fact that we've taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> a third</font>

603
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:04,340
of their things in turn them into<font color="#CCCCCC"> one a</font>

604
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:06,080
as an indication even surely that

605
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,169
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been some consultation and some</font>

606
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,490
listening and that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> B is again</font>

607
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,720
another third of the things we've agreed

608
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,070
with the principal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to work</font>

609
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">with them on the implementation so I've</font>

00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">their of their objections two-thirds of</font>

00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:19,310
them we have substantially agreed with

612
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,110
so how how you can how we can describe

613
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:23,240
that as not making progress i'm not

614
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:26,199
quite sure and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i may I contribute</font>

615
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,850
Kiran you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about how we</font>

just the collective effort whether you

635
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,159
is very clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government advisory</font>

Larry Strickling assistant secretary

00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,090
Strickling is shared with me directly

00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:28,250
that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was very pleased</font>

640
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,629
East overall with how it goes that

641
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:31,130
doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some individuals at</font>

642
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:32,900
some point in times won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be critical i</font>

643
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,510
think they certainly will and that's a

644
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:39,140
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthy part of the process but</font>

645
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:41,539
clearly it is the the first time we held

646
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,970
such a dedicated meeting separately

647
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:45,890
outside and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can meeting and great</font>

648
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,200
great great resources and efforts went

649
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:50,929
into it and i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> many parties are</font>

650
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,520
appreciative and and some might not may

651
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:54,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">have different views I think you might</font>

652
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,570
also want to review secretary assistant

653
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,908
secretary Strickland's transcripts this

654
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,740
morning my sense is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that his comments</font>

655
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:03,830
were quite positive overall about the

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> assessment of the conversion and</font>

00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:21,860
adoption of ipv6 how's the education

process coming along and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what else needs</font>

00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,969
to be done before I can is fully

665
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:29,240
satisfied with the conversion and

666
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:31,429
adoption sure I'll sure thank you very

667
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:35,270
much for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question about ipv6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

668
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:38,960
adoption clearly we see the adoption

669
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:41,059
accelerating and you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple</font>

670
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,669
data point is we measure traffic to the

671
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:46,520
ICANN org website and and whether it's

672
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:49,669
initiated coming through ipv4 or ipv6 in

673
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,850
the last half of last year alone it grew

674
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:55,159
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> about 1% ipv6 to about seven</font>

675
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:57,350
percent now granted the community that

676
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:59,270
accesses I can org is perhaps a little

677
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,549
more technologically advanced and savvy

678
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:04,549
than others<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i also want to explain</font>

679
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:07,510
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> our role in ipv6 is really as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

fulfilling the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iono function and while</font>

682
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:15,350
we play some role in advocating ipv6

683

adoption we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really rely upon our</font>

through global efforts they coordinate

organizations that are their members so

699
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,730
I cans role in ipv6 adoption is we have

700
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,110
a technical coordination role where

701
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,330
we're very active because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a</font>

ICANN going from the estimates I heard

738

in the room last night were 60 million

739
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:24,409

00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,080
future of that money I mean if each

743
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:33,220

<font color="#CCCCCC">in expenditure where is that funding</font>

745
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,160
well neither some we're certainly not

we're dedicated nonprofit and remain say

748
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:45,080
and will remain so the first thing to

749
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,520
say is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the project itself has cost</font>

I think rod can perhaps help with us but

00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,360
we're looking at close to a million

766
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:19,679
reasonably large sum in that fee based

767
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,480
around risk and risk assessment and

768

that's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that's litigation risk</font>

773

those rounds go open the fee is very

actually costs to run these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so I</font>

785
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,690
think you should take all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those sorts of</font>

numbers with a very careful very large

are any surpluses that come into I can

789
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,659
as a result of that exercise the

790
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,340
community will be the people who decide

791
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:06,840
how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be spent and I think</font>

792
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,939
there's already there's already lots of

793

interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> from developing world as to how</font>

00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">that some of that surplus might be spent</font>

had shared platforms on many topics

00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:54,429
including at the IGF and I'm thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

837
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:57,220
Sharm el-sheikh for example and we've

838
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:59,080
seen I think a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship</font>

839
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:02,350
developing between us and the ITU on

840
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,360
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> area more recently at the ITU</font>

841
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,699
plenty pot there was some recognition

842
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,879
and some of the ITU documents about the

843
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,980
I can roll in its coordination function

844
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:14,320
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think what secretary-general tareas</font>

845
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,090
always said is that the ITU should

846
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,950
concentrate on what the ITU was set up

847
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:19,629
to do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can should do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I cans job and</font>

848
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,029
I think that's pretty much my view we're

849
00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:23,408
fairly clear what our role is it's

850
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:25,960
relatively narrow it's the technical

851
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:28,240
coordination of these internet names and

852
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,070
numbers and the some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> related</font>

853
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,710
functions and it's very different from

854
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,000
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITU does and where we do have</font>

855
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,860
some intersections and there are some

856
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,200
intersections where our policies come

857
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,969
together then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have we're on some</font>

858
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,320
number of joint working groups and we

859
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,940
have reasonably good relationships many

860
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,519
of the same people who work with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

861
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:47,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">our working groups work on i.t i.t you</font>

862
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,750
working groups so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are</font>

863
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:52,480
moving forward we regard them as a very

864
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:54,009
important player in the ecosystem and I

865
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,460
think relationships are probably better

866
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:58,899
than they've been I suppose I'll just

867
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,879
reminded me of the other thing that but

868
00:32:58,899 --> 00:33:02,678
i always think is so obvious that

869
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:05,289
doesn't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said and that is that</font>

870
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:07,539
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> itu is a functioning member of i can</font>

871
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:09,879
there are three places in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITU</font>

872
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:11,799
structure within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can structure</font>

with the ITU has a roll<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of the</font>

874
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:15,940
bylaws they have for example position I

875
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,449
think all the nominating committee they

876
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,850
have a

877
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:20,890
their membership and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GAC and we</font>

878
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:23,040
right now have an ITU liaison on our

879
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:27,270
board so there's a number of

880
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:29,710
institutional relationships with the ITU

881
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:32,560
Peter this is clearly the aimed at you

882
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:34,870
can you give us any insights as to what

883
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:38,110
any board action may be regarding da

884
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:39,429
Rippa<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lex on Friday yes I'm happy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

885
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:42,639
that that's back on the agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

887
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,370
clear what the board is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and</font>

888
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,830
I don't speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them there'll be</font>

889
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:49,090
there'll be another vote historically

890
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,679
those votes have been reasonably

891
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,970
interesting they've been quite close

892
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,100
they've raised a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues and</font>

893
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:56,590
it's been one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those topics I think</font>

894
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,060
after which we've had more board members

895
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,010
wanting to go speak and go on the record

896
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:02,980
explaining the rationale for the views

897
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:05,140
than previously that may well<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">same this time but yes it's on the</font>

00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:10,120
agenda for friday<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to</font>

900
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:11,860
ask about dot jobs and the steps taken

901
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:16,239
with them and what what is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

902
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:18,340
phase of that what can we expect well

903
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,989
first it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second time and I can</font>

904
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:22,720
history I believe that we've issued a

905
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:25,719
breach notice to a registry last time

906
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:28,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">was in 2003 and I think it reflects our</font>

907
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:30,819
very serious commitment to compliance

908
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:34,270
and contractual compliance with

909
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:37,210
registries and registrar's and I I will

910
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:38,710
not speculate on next steps and if you

911
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:42,310
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a more in-depth discussion</font>

912
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:44,620
i would ask our general counsel whoo-hoo

913
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:47,770
the replying compliance team reports to

914
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,880
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have him speak with you guys</font>

915
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:51,280
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the to the question about</font>

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,040
things we're doing with the GAC here of

918
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:57,009
course is having a bylaws consultation

919
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,600
with the GAC about XXX and so we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

920
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:01,420
was assuming seeking before that we've

921
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,150
we will have had that consultation with

922
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:05,050
the GAC and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will have worked through</font>

understanding what the gay<font color="#CCCCCC"> advisors</font>

00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,480
there's all there's always the

925
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:10,510
possibility i guess that we would have

926
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:14,050
reached a difficulty<font color="#CCCCCC"> in doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,850
this kind of clarifying prices so that

we understand and have captured yeah

know there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of conflict of</font>
