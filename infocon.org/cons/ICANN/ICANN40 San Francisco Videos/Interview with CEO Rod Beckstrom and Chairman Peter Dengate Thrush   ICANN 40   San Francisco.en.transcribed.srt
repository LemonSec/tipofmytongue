we've had it started a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

ago and this applicant came in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been considering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this for some</font>

basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> ignored the advice of the</font>

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,269

25
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,769
existence of the governmental<font color="#CCCCCC"> Advisory</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Committee we created that as a special</font>

33
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:07,800
thoroughly and that's exactly what we've

34
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,000
done in this case we this is advice that

35
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,880
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> received from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them going back to</font>

39
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,789
what it was they'd said and thought more

40
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,619
about the advice so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the process the the consultation that we</font>

44
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,460
and I think we've we've done a careful

45
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,950
job what does the dark XXX issue mean in

terms of icons dispute resolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

47
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,860
think it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> testament to the</font>

48
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,990
accountability mechanism that we've

49
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,190
created this is the independent review

50
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,559
process so when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board makes a</font>

51
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,750
decision a person who feels they've been

52
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,370
badly affected by a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision can take it</font>

53
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,530
away and get independent review which is

54
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,640
what this applicant did and that panel

55
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,410
found that the board had acted

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,050
improperly in declining the application

57
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,640
on certain grounds last time and so the

58
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,960
board has accepted that and they this

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,340
applicant has come back on through

60
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,289
another process we've done more due

61
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,290
diligence we've thought again about the

62
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,210
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as you saw today by a nine</font>

63
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,519
to three e vote the board has decided

that on this occasion<font color="#E5E5E5"> the African has</font>

70
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,000
publicly about the multi-stakeholder

stakeholder groups chiming in and

81
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,630
contributing their thoughts so

82
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,518
developing a very open<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the board</font>

used the process came up with one

decision that was disputed is Peter

85
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,299
mention overturned and now the board has

86
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,220
listened to the individual independent

87
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:59,140
review panel which specifically is the

88
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,180
body that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had the responsibility to</font>

different stakeholder views you know on

00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,500
this topic as we saw at the public<font color="#CCCCCC"> mic</font>

and through<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of our sessions so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

93
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:15,069
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board did its utmost to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">listen to different views and to then</font>

00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:32,170
seem to be on a feared degradation of

100
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,480
the DNS route in that context is that a

101
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,480
valid<font color="#CCCCCC"> concern or is that merely a</font>

102
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,608
smokescreen for opposition<font color="#CCCCCC"> well again</font>

103
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,349
let's came from advice from the GAC GAC

104
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:43,150
asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider carefully what this</font>

105
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:44,768
meant and so we took very senior

106
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,510
technical advice from experts in this

107
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:49,810
area and we heard one of them talking on

108
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,970
the board today somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a liaison</font>

109
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,079
from the root server committee that

110
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,790
actually operates the root of the

112
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,349
from that was that this is not going to

113
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:02,650
have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact on on the blocking that</font>

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">ICANN's relationship with the US</font>

00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,880
well the US government<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a number of</font>

relationships so that I can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

121
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,000
important one I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think in this context is</font>

122
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,130
that they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fully active member of</font>

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,570
the governmental<font color="#E5E5E5"> advisory committee so</font>

124
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,310
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been participating inside the</font>

125
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,620
GAC in terms of formulating the advice

126
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,020
that's been coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the board we</font>

127
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,360
understand that the GAC the u.s.

128
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,280
position inside the GAC and they've set

129
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,170
it outside has been that they actually

130
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">have no position either for or against</font>

131
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:43,830
xxx rod where do we stand now in terms

132
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,330
of a timeline<font color="#E5E5E5"> as regards da xxx we</font>

133
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,500
really move an implementation out at

134
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,919
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time so if you look at the</font>

135
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,360
resolutions the board has has instructed

136
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,950
me or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> general counsel to move ahead</font>

137
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,110
with a contract with xxx I to govern the

138
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:01,229
overall registry relationship that we

139
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,490
have will then also simultaneously move

140
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,740
on the technical front in terms of

141
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:08,130
technical validation for the delegation

142
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:12,120
issue and then once all those technical

143
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:13,830
checks are done and the board approvals

144
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,210
in place<font color="#CCCCCC"> will move towards delegation</font>

145
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,250
into the root of the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

146
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,500
the rest is really up to them will

147
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,940
monitor compliance from then on but in

148
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">terms of development of their new</font>

149
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,840
top-level domain the rest will be in

150

their hands let's jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to new gTLDs</font>

151
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,520
summarize for me in a nutshell after

152
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,039
today's board meeting where are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we on</font>

153
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,870
expanding that<font color="#E5E5E5"> space well I think today</font>

154
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">we saw a resolution that the entire</font>

155
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,140
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually applauded and they</font>

156
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,300
applauded it because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they can</font>

157
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">get behind it we've got a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timeline</font>

158
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,900
taking this down to an actual launch

159
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,820
date which we've not actually had before

160
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,349
we've actually said Monday the twentieth

161
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,390
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> June to be the date at which the</font>

162
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">board is going to launch this program so</font>

163
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,599
that's a first we've had other timelines

164
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,550
before but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not one I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the</font>

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">community and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the board feels is going</font>

166
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:59,310
to be so achievable as this one and what

167
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,080
we've done is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

168
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,000
days of consultations we've had with the

00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,400
government's since since the card i

170
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,130
Haena meeting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> december we've</font>

171
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,630
scheduled two more iterations two more

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,530
consultation and a further and de

175
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,990
sessional meeting with the GAC probably

176
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,179
by telephone conference before we get to

177
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:24,060
that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> why does this new timeline</font>

178
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,200
have any degree<font color="#CCCCCC"> of credibility like</font>

179
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,600
bread because the community is behind it

180
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,280
we saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with the reaction today and</font>

181
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,350
that's because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think if the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> community</font>

182
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,020
now feels that most of the heart issues

183
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:37,000
are on the table or behind us if you

184
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,859
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gac</font>

185
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,180
scorecard for example where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gac gave</font>

186
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,170
us advice it look there's these 12

187
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,820
issues that we think need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

188
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">addressed we ought to the consultation</font>

189
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,969
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brussels we took a third of those</font>

190
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,890
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the table let's put that was pretty</font>

191
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,780
impressive at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting we've taken</font>

192
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,979
another chunk off the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we've</font>

193
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">got the next process which hopefully</font>

194
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,940
will either resolve them or be quite

195
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,250
clear that we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to resolve</font>

196
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,960
them and so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> people feel that</font>

197
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,880
that that work<font color="#CCCCCC"> now puts us in a position</font>

198
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,440
with us is a very achievable<font color="#CCCCCC"> time scale</font>

199
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,030
are they<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a lot of members of</font>

200
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">the community going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've heard this</font>

201
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,390
before well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think so as I say</font>

202
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,980
we'd not have we've not had a time line

203
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,020
that goes down that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually finishes</font>

204
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,060
not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the board resolution as I</font>

205
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,659
as I announced after that to the to the

206
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,370
audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> the public to to the community</font>

207
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,050
the reason why we're doing this way is

208
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,220
so that we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have bring the</font>

209
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,720
entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> community together in a</font>

210
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,180
celebration we're actually scheduling

211
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,520
that the launch<font color="#E5E5E5"> party for on Wednesday</font>

212
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,080
after the board resolution and I think

213
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,030
you saw in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that community you know Greg</font>

214
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,520
you love support for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that idea in the</font>

215
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:36,309
past the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GAC has seemed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say to the</font>

216
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,169
board you're seeking our advice we're

217
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,990
giving it to you you are making a

218
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:43,540
decision we're not clear on how the

219
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,750
advice we gave you fit into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this final</font>

220
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:49,510
decision is that still a valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern</font>

221
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,040
well let's be clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the XXX</font>

222
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,349
decision we've published a<font color="#E5E5E5"> twinkie page</font>

223
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,220
rationale of the decision in relation

224
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,710
that and we've gone through very

225
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,050
carefully explaining what the GAC advice

226
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,599
was and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> what our reaction to it to</font>

227
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,970
it is and just just by way of one

228
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,000
example the GAC advice was to be careful

229
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:09,640
in relation to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> contract that might get</font>

230
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,920
us involved in administering content and

231
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,659
we've explained in that that many of the

232
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">activities we take in relation to our</font>

233
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,250
TLD contracts require the same kind of

234
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,410
monitoring and supervision so this

235
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,270
doesn't change in any way the board's

236
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,100
relationship or I can't relationship to

237
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,890
the TLD operators it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to</font>

coordinate as much operations as

around da XXX and new gTLDs there's been

261
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:28,189
very little written or talked about in

00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,640
important I mean I said there's two

265
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,110
there's three foundational documents in

266
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,720
some sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> that shape I can there's the</font>

267
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,910
bylaws you know that were developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,290
the community in a process<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the US</font>

269
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,260
government helped to coordinate but but

270
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,000
approved by the community there's the

271
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,380
affirmation of commitments which is

272
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,510
replaced the previous agreements and

273
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,550
there's the an agreement so the bylaws

274
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,560
we just had some resolutions changing

275
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,599
and tuning against today<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's gone</font>

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">through many cycles affirmation we got</font>

as an<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to improve the</font>

organization make it further global and

00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:10,280
I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking forward to hearing</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the feedback that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes from the global</font>

284
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,880
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we encouraged everyone to respond</font>

285
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:19,610
whatever their views might be they might

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,320
be pro I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> auntie I can't or want it</font>

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,600
reshaped or want it rebound they could

288
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,950
want any set of changes and we really

289
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,780
just hope whatever their thoughts are

290
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,940
they engaged because it's that wealth of

291
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,730
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinions and perspectives that</font>

292
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,500
will move<font color="#E5E5E5"> this multi-stakeholder system</font>

293
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,030
forward let me follow up on that

294
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,100
throughout the week you mentioned

295
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:39,050
multi-stakeholder system throughout<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

296
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,660
week long meeting here there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

297
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:43,479
widely resident and repetitive voice

298
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,740
support for the multi-stakeholder model

299
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,810
so much so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it leads some to</font>

300
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,420
question whether this model of

301
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,660
governance is at risk

302
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,880
III don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this models at risk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

303
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's functioning so yes there are</font>

304
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,770
clearly other groups that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to</font>

305
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,050
take over parts of the the mandate or

306
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:04,810
the scope or the portfolio but the

307
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,939
reality is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this model is working</font>

308
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,199
because the internet works and the

309
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet continues to go through a</font>

310
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,110
tremendous growth tremendous diversity

311
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:16,060
you look at the richness of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy</font>

312
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:18,520
practices a policy development process

313
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,560
the best practices all the efforts going

314
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,689
on here I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

315
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,329
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever match that in top-down system</font>

316
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,550
tinnitus had two points<font color="#CCCCCC"> I agree a good</font>

317
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,810
with the rods description other we

318
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually heard from two very important</font>

319
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,020
people today who spoke out very

320
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,300
positively in favor of the model first

321
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,069
was President Clinton at the gala and

322
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,750
was his administer it was in his

323
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">administration that this was set up and</font>

324
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:42,070
he still favors this kind of model for

325
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,180
this kind of exercise and the second one

326
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,700
was from the current administration

327
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,770
Larry Strickling in his speech spoke out

328
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,210
very positively about how good the

329
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,650
multi-stakeholder model isn't

330
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,510
particularly in relation to managing

331
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,010
this kind of operation so I think you

332
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">know history historically end and</font>

333
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,090
currently we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of support</font>

334
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">from people the picture you two are</font>

335
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,090
painting of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the relationship between</font>

336
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:04,990
this organization and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US government</font>

337
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:07,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">is much rosier than that what you order</font>

338
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,730
in hallway conversations throughout the

339
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,350
week there is a lot of genuine concern

340
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,300
about i cants relationship with the US

341
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,370
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you two gentlemen appear</font>

342
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,260
to be saying is not so it's a very

343
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,690
workable functional qualitative

344
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,640
relationship it's clearly a stream<font color="#E5E5E5"> lee</font>

345
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,380
constructive and productive relationship

346
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,600
I mean we<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have regular meetings with</font>

347
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,220
assistant<font color="#E5E5E5"> secretary Strickling our staff</font>

348
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,530
have regular meetings with Department of

349
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,960
Commerce Peter served on the ATR tea

350
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:33,010
with assistant secretary<font color="#CCCCCC"> strictly</font>

351
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,810
there's many different touch points

352
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:38,020
between our organization as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

353
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:40,510
broadly across the US government very

354
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,610
productive overall any good relationship

355
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,530
I mean we are stewards for the root of

356
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,680
the Internet among different things now

357
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:49,660
that's a very serious role it's a big

358
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,729
responsibilities are tough decisions

359
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,800
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very understandable that parties</font>

360
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,750
might have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinions and we</font>

361
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,520
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's great actually that the u.s.</font>

362
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,530
government when they have thoughts and

363
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,470
opinions are sharing those publicly with

364
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,279
the world you know post posting letters

365
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,930
on our web

366
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,120
such as they did in<font color="#E5E5E5"> December that that's</font>

367
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:10,120
that's a very transparent process and if

368
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything just affirms at how important i</font>

369
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,749
can is and the whole multi-stakeholder

370
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,420
community and how the model work so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

371
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:19,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very constructive and</font>

372
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:22,059
functional relationship Peter let me ask

373
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:24,279
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a final</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now and the</font>

374
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:26,740
next meeting and Singapore what are the

375
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:28,809
critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> timeline points that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font>

376
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">between this meeting and that meeting</font>

377
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:34,360
well in relation to the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld program</font>

378
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:35,619
in relation to any issue well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I but the</font>

379
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,449
most obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> one that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

380
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,249
would they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be working on that is</font>

381
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:41,469
the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD program because there's so</font>

382
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:42,550
many steps that have to be met but I'm

383
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,350
confident that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to meet those</font>

384
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,349
the the first is we're expecting to

385
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,699
receive a written report<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> written</font>

386
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">reply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the government advisory</font>

387
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:53,800
committee to our last paper we're

388
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,439
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at publishing final</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> score card</font>

389
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,508
shown really what the areas of agreement

390
00:13:56,439 --> 00:14:00,189
are and what the areas of disagreement

391
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:02,050
if any and that's is going to be quite

392
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:03,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">an important document because if there</font>

393
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,959
are still any areas of<font color="#E5E5E5"> disagreement</font>

394
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:06,910
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have one more final</font>

395
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,500
conference probably teleconference with

396
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,329
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GAC to try and do that final</font>

397
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,769
resolution on those and then under the

398
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:13,359
bylaws we will have to publish as we've

399
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:15,819
done today you know a reasonably

400
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,529
detailed rationale of areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we if</font>

401
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:19,300
we're going to where we disagree with

402
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:20,680
the GAC and there's production of the

403
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,269
actual guide book itself people will

404
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,800
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that text and</font>

405
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:26,980
then as I say there's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> final meeting</font>

406
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,839
on Monday June the 20th when hopefully

407
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,790
the board will give that resolution to

408
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,040
go ahead so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's quite a</font>

409
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,750
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very very diligent</font>

410
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,430
hard-working staff who've been

411
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,809
supporting this process tremendously

412
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,969
through through the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> months and</font>

413
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:41,559
years so that's that that's quite an

414
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity for for us and for the</font>

415
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:45,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">community to actually complete this</font>

416
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:49,379
project and have a celebration gentlemen

417
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,378
<font color="#CCCCCC">thank you very much thank your bread</font>
