ancient times when dinosaurs ruled the

a landline coming to where they live it

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,660

the US economy and our initial meeting

38
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,729
we listed<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten different things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font>

39
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:50,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">at that we thought could be important by</font>

40
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:54,658
the beginning of 1996 we had actually

41
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:57,449
decided on a different list basically

42
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we had decided was that there were</font>

43
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,490
three technologies that had been

44
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,610
developed recently that could offer the

45
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,649
potential for huge economic growth the

46
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet the sequencing of the human</font>

47
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,970
genome and advances in renewable energy

48
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,500
and of those three<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

49
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,470
thought that the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> could move the</font>

50
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,090
fastest and so by then we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided to</font>

51
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,250
focus on the internet and trying to

52
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,740
create a global environment where the

53
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:27,220
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> could take off and be a true</font>

54
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,960
economic force the landscape we

55
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,990
confronted was fraught with opportunity

56
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,490
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> also with tremendous uncertainty</font>

57
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,140
many entrepreneurs and companies wanted

58
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,480
to invest huge sums to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build the</font>

59
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet economy but they were worried</font>

60
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,100
by the lack of a predictable environment

61
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,230
at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> time some of you may remember</font>

62
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,209
there were proposals in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the EU in Canada</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks every bit of transmission</font>

to protect intellectual property that

was the landscape we confronted many

not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to adopt the internet because</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">they viewed it as under US government</font>

85

control and there were a large number of

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,269
lawsuits which I'll talk about in a

87

minute working their way through

different courts around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world that</font>

89
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,660
would have broken up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and</font>

put jurisdictional restrictions on it

that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have prevented</font>

interoperability across countries or

95
00:03:54,459 --> 00:04:00,100
lawsuits had no clue what the internet

96
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,950
was the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the internet was</font>

97
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,450
very uncertain some of the root servers

98
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,369
were in<font color="#E5E5E5"> University basements where</font>

99
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,679
anyone could walk in and pull the plug I

100
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,540
know because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I visited some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

101
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,690
sites unannounced and just walked alone

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">into rooms where they were housed we</font>

103
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,250
realized that the internet had enormous

104
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,350
potential to unlock human freedom

105
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,970
economically politically and socially

106
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,680
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> its very design empowered</font>

107
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,810
individuals by allowing them to

108
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,340
meant their ideas directly without

109
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,830
having to go through established

110
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,380
hierarchies and bureaucracies the

111
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,419
potential seemed limitless but we also

112
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,240
realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the internet</font>

113
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:39,609
was very precarious balanced on a

114
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,370
knife's edge between two extremes that

115
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:45,550
could delay its Advent or even destroy

116
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:48,280
it on the one side if the internet was

117
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,800
too anarchic with no guidelines that

118
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,580
could degenerate into a constant state

119
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,900
of unpredictable wild west shootouts

120
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,630
scaring away the decent folk who wanted

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> invest in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help build it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

such a way as to allow as much freedom

prefixes were four countries and who in

the a root server was run by a company

234
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,140
at the time John and the leadership<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

291
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:20,689
was unprecedented but we felt it offered

the best chance to<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

would get bogged down in bureaucracy and

297

298
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:34,850
personally I'm a believer that

299
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,069
governments play an important role in

you're having a controversy every week

406
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:49,390
the fact of the matter is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font>

407
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:52,360
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> flourished it has grown and</font>

408
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:55,390
flourished and i can tell you sitting

409
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:59,770
where we were in the late 1990s that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

410
00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:03,010
not at all a foregone conclusion in fact

411
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:07,180
it seemed like a likely thing that could

412
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:08,439
go bad and not happen now would things

413
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,180
have worked as well if we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

414
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,160
created<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can and did the other things</font>

415
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:15,520
we did maybe you know you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

416
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,530
speculate but the reality is that for

417
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,870
all its shortcomings i can has not

418
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:21,670
prevented this resolution and by most

419
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:25,150
accounts it has played an important and

420
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,800
positive role in helping to enable it so

421
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:30,670
the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my history lesson today</font>

422
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,709
is to remind you all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the internet</font>

almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> broke down before it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really took</font>

424
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:37,960
off in the late 1990s and it almost

425
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,040
broke down in legal political and policy

426
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:43,780
disputes that could have fragmented it

427
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,760
inhibit its use and the very least

428
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:49,660
delayed it and made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it more difficult to</font>

access while icon has its faults<font color="#E5E5E5"> I urge</font>

430
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,069
you to work actively to improve it

431
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,810
rather than tearing it down or allowing

432
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,990
it to be replaced with a more stifling

433

<font color="#CCCCCC">friend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine said the good news</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

436
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,520
that for the first time in six years

437
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,400
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able to say what you</font>

438
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,859
really think

439
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,450
the bad news is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the first time</font>

440
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:17,060
in six years nobody will care what you

441
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:18,710
really think but at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk of having</font>

442
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:21,079
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> be true and have you not care what</font>

443
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:26,170
I think let me just finish by offering a

444
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:29,780
couple of suggestions and I offer them

445
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:32,660
in the spirit of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> success that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

446
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,000
believe i can has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been and the greater</font>

447
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,590
success that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can be I think there are</font>

448
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that I can should do to work</font>

449
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:41,330
better and that the reaffirmation of

450
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,520
principles issued in September of 2009

451
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,919
offers a good basis for making these

452
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,889
improvements and I think having talked

453
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,720
this past few weeks to people that I can

454
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:54,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">people at the US government elsewhere I</font>

455
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,880
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aware that these</font>

456
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,340
improvements can be made and are working

457
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would just give support</font>

458
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,959
to that effort one is I can always needs

459
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work hard to be more international</font>

460
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,560
and in particular will include more

461
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in its leadership and management</font>

462
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,970
from developing countries<font color="#CCCCCC"> around the</font>

463
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,550
world the Internet has become much more

464
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,830
widely distributed since we were

465
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,870
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 years ago and will become</font>

466
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">even more widely distributed still and</font>

467
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:23,179
as somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who now is working on AIDS</font>

468
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:24,379
in Africa and elsewhere and interacting

469
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,830
a lot with governments in poorer

470
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:30,320
countries it's crucial that they become

471
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:33,169
more and more a part of this structure

472
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,090
as much as possible number two I can

473
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,310
must take great<font color="#CCCCCC"> pens</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to operate in an</font>

efficient manner it's a public service

00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:42,470
organization with the technical mission

476
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:44,960
that should be frugal and it must always

477
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:46,820
have humility in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's works its</font>

478
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,420
leaders must avoid trying to build an

479
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:53,659
empire I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be best served</font>

00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">by doing what you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be doing to be</font>

481

focused on but not build something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

482
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:00,500
is too big an empire because a bigger

483
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,820
Empire becomes a bigger target number

484
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:10,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">three</font>

485
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:12,740
I can must be incorruptible and fully

486
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:14,900
transparent in what it does Seeking

487
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,360
consensus and explaining its decisions

488
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,980
fully there are too many disparate

489
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,409
interests on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid</font>

controversy you're going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

492
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:28,460
that are unpopular by definition not

493
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">only is this a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very diverse community</font>

494
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,240
but it's a diverse community<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

495
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,180
with strong personalities that's

496
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,680
something I learned very<font color="#CCCCCC"> early on and so</font>

497
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,600
you're going to have lots of controversy

498
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:42,530
lots of people shouting at each other

499
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,790
lots of ideas lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ideas and you're</font>

500
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,580
never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to get full</font>

501
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:49,070
consensus but you ought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to get as</font>

502
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:51,620
much consensus as possible all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

503
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,090
and where you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have consensus you</font>

504
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,439
need full transparency and

505
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,510
accountability and explaining your

506
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,680
decisions because that way even if

507
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,860
people disagree with it they can

508
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,410
understand the logic behind what you did

509
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:05,000
so consensus will not always be possible

510
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:07,220
but you must do the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> to seek as much</font>

511
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,040
consensus as possible and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain</font>

512
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:13,040
your decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> fourth I can should</font>

513
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,659
always look to empower<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet users do</font>

514
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,159
not make a rule that limits what people

515
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,650
can do on the internet unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

516
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,390
absolutely necessary for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet to</font>

517
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:23,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">function in a predictable safe and</font>

518
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:25,690
secure way and finally I'll offer this

519
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,250
to my successors in the US government

520
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they should exercise their role in</font>

521
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:35,470
full consultation with other governments

522
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:37,850
and in a light handed matter now I think

523
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,350
if those kinds of principles are

524
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,120
followed and I do think there are people

525
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,830
of goodwill at I can and in the US

526
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">government and elsewhere interested in</font>

527
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,879
following those principles I think I can

528
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,910
will continue to flourish and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

529

internet will flourish I can processes

530
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:54,200
will always be a bit messy grassroots

531
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,929
democracy is by its nature contentious

532
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,240
but I can can and must improve we should

533
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:01,160
all work within it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> improve it rather</font>
