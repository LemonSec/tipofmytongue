Tara Cameron it's hard for me to stand

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:30,050

53
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,860
year to be able to set this up giving

54
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:58,790
them a round of applause please

55
00:02:48,860 --> 00:03:00,620
I came in about three years ago and one

56
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,739
of the things that amazes me is how I

57
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:07,250
can continues to evolve adopt new

58
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:10,310
challenges to work on not all things

59
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,720
happens fast for instance we're still

60
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:16,420
happening - opening ceremony in the

61
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:20,389
morning I'm still working on it

62
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:23,149
so I fought myself coming into this what

63
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:26,720
would what would Tareq say what was he's

64
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,459
message be to all of us this morning and

65
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,230
when he's been around for two decades in

66
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:33,260
this and even longer I met Eric first

67
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:37,040
time in 2009 when he was in Sharm

68
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:40,179
el-sheikh and I think that he often

69
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,650
spoke about the fact that we're not done

70
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,280
we're working to get the next billion

71
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,959
users online that is our goal because we

72
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,669
believe by connecting people on this

73
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,220
thing we call the Internet something

74
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:54,250
magical happens I can ask the

75
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,250
institution doesn't matter about the

76
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,720
financial systems or in that sense

77
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,609
economic growth but we do believe in the

78
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,980
fact that if you connect people on this

79
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:05,630
thing we call the Internet something

80
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:09,679
magical actually happens it's about

81
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:11,930
sharing information with each other and

82
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,180
why the multi-stakeholder model think

83
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,160
about it for a second in this room now

84
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,639
in this meeting now we have two and a

85
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,519
half thousand people from

86
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,069
thirty countries can you tell me any

87
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,479
other locations with so many individuals

88
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:26,909
around the world actually comes together

89
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,840
to talk about a common goal I can't

90
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:32,759
figure about it maybe the Olympics the

91
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,400
the fact of the matter is that you are

92
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,999
unique and I can as its substance is

93
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:42,090
unique what makes it unique is you the

94
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:44,370
diversity the differences the difference

95
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,849
in opinions they all bring together that

96
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:49,590
is really what I can is all about

97
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:50,699
and we do that in most of times with

98
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,590
respect for each other

99
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:58,529
we do that by sometimes arguing

100
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:01,560
sometimes even shouting but we reach the

101
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:03,810
consensus in the end and I don't think

102
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,389
and I've called Iten before at large

103
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:09,569
peace project and I still believe it is

104
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,129
and it's thanks to you and I know Tarek

105
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:22,139
is looking down on us and saying hmm

106
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:25,800
you're doing okay as such but we're also

107
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:28,400
losing Shireen it's actually quite old

108
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,199
even if it doesn't like the look so I

109
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:36,210
want to say this joke was written by his

110
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:40,800
speech widget writer or as I said he's

111
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:45,599
still alive I want to take this

112
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:48,120
opportunity to honor Sheree he was

113
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,259
heavily involved of hiring me don't say

114
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,960
that as a negative I actually liked it

115
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:58,830
he's been with us for nine years he's

116
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,688
been a clear leader and the remarkable

117
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,389
thing is that he didn't come from the

118
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:08,250
internet ecosystem it was thrown in by

119
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:12,330
Nam Kham and he immediately I understand

120
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:15,000
adopted to this greater thing that I can

121
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:19,938
represent and you're welcome in and

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,990
trained him and his passion wisdom

123
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:26,729
sometimes business acumen

124
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:29,400
I served as well I think that shereen's

125
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:32,280
leadership together with many of youse

126
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:36,380
was very important during the transition

127
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:39,719
and actually thanks to his hard work

128
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:42,570
we're more mature more transparent

129
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,090
organization united much more in a

130
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:49,169
common vision of achieving our strategic

131
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:53,460
plan a great leader possesses many

132
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:57,330
qualities they inspire us they make us

133
00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:00,930
come together they guide us even in road

134
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,609
is little bit unclear they show us and

135
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,340
make sure that we don't remember to do

136
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,650
the right thing they show us compassing

137
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,859
and understanding no matter how things

138
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,859
get

139
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:16,830
Shareen has many of those qualities you

140
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,739
know what when he speak which I'm trying

141
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:24,780
to learn from he thinks about every word

142
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:26,430
he says and I know that what you said is

143
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,909
honestly is that now and marked in his

144
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:31,440
step in abort you helped him you helped

145
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:35,639
him to understand what it means to be

146
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,400
