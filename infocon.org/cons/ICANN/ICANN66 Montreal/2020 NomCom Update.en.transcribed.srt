00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,540
I'm here I can 66 in Montreal Canada

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,809
with members of the 2020 nominating

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,480
committee or NomCom jason ascii ola

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:18,390
jacobson and him and Ashcraft j can you

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,279
explain the role that i'm come yeah the

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,430
NomCom has a very important role within

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,350
the i cant ecosystem many nonprofit

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,359
organizations have a concept of a

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,220
nominating committee but the way i can

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,990
does its NomCom is very different than a

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,460
typical nominating committee and it's

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,829
reflective of the multi-stakeholder

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,829
model and the practices and the

15
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:40,500
importance that of things that are

16
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,540
happening here at ICANN so all all

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:48,769
members are all parts of the community

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:50,879
within i can g NSO c so a lack the ASO

19
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,550
technical even the CAC has it has a

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,980
option to participate within the NomCom

21
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,828
so our entire committee consists of over

22
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,959
20 members who get together and meet

23
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,650
face to face four times over the course

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,960
of the year to recruit new candidates

25
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,880
for open leadership positions do

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,339
candidate assessment work and then make

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,270
our final selections and present them to

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,439
the community at the 2020 AGM Olli what

29
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,839
are the board positions I need to be

30
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,139
filled by the 2020 comm this year there

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,840
is two positions for the ICANN board and

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,280
one position for the PTI board Jay how

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,020
was the 2020 timeline different than

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,840
2019 and how is that new timeline

35
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,210
advantageous yes so there's a major

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,150
difference with the timeline this year

37
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,669
historically the NomCom application

38
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,950
window has opened in January and closed

39
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,689
at the end of March this year we're

40
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,780
changing the application window said

41
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:48,240
that it will open in mid December and it

42
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,280
will close in mid-february the reason

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,890
why we're doing this is it will allow us

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,840
to come to I can 67 and begin our

45
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,049
candidate assessment work

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,810
face to face which provides much higher

47
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,570
quality work and and allows the

48
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,009
committee to be much more effective one

49
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,048
of the other benefits of moving the

50
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,979
timeline up is that we'll also be able

51
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,600
to do full committee interviews of

52
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:14,940
candidates for gns Ola

53
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,730
in CC NSO which is a new thing that the

54
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,280
NomCom is doing this year historically

55
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:22,910
only the deep dive teams a team of two

56
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,350
or three members have have interviewed

57
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,370
candidates for those positions Damon

58
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,690
what are the other leadership positions

59
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,750
and why do they offer great

60
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,790
opportunities to get involved sure the

61
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,280
other leadership positions include two

62
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,709
for the at-large Advisory Committee or a

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,480
lack and those are there's one position

64
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,030
out of a two for a North American

65
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,790
candidate and one position out of a two

66
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,340
for a European candidate in addition to

67
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,410
that we also have a position on the

68
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,440
generic name supporting organization or

69
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,750
gns oh and also a position for the CC

70
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,150
NSO or country code name supporting

71
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,130
organization and those are those

72
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,040
positions are very important because I

73
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:04,680
can is a bottom-up model and so a lot of

74
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,500
the positions within the a lack the CC

75
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,870
NSO and the G NSO are helping to develop

76
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,730
built the policies or comment on the

77
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,070
policies and give guidance for the

78
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,109
overall organization and for the board

79
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,430
to consider Olli can you tell us what

80
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,410
the NAM comes work on transparency

81
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,720
accountability and the ongoing efforts

82
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,520
to be in the forefront sure so starting

83
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,820
a few years ago the NomCom has been

84
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:30,030
publishing progress reports what's new

85
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,890
this year that will also do publish our

86
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,570
operational procedures and voting

87
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,220
documents so that everything that we do

88
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,269
apart from information about the

89
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,220
candidates of course which is

90
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:41,490
confidential will be available to the

91
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,080
public and also blog posts and various

92
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,940
updates of that of that nature

93
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,560
J considering how diverse the ICANN

94
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,750
community is what is being done to

95
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,340
ensure a diverse pool of candidates we

96
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,310
took a number of measures on the NomCom

97
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,110
to ensure that we do have a diverse pool

98
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,510
of candidates last year the NomCom

99
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,510
started partnering with multiple global

100
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,350
and regional computing firms and this

101
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,390
year we're going to continue that

102
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,730
practice so in the process of selecting

103
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,589
those firms currently this will allow us

104
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,329
to target regions that have historically

105
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,420
been underrepresented in leadership

106
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,490
positions within I can we also in

107
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,130
general have a high level of diversity

108
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:19,070
within the NomCom itself and we ask our

109
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,229
members on the committee to go and

110
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,630
recruit people for the open leadership

111
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,400
positions through their networks so just

112
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,310
from that first year we get

113
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,989
a lot of exposure globally and helps

114
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,370
drive diversity well gentlemen thank you

115
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,530
for joining me today and talking about

116
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:41,640
the 2020 NomCom thank you

117
