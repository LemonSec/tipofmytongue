2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:10,530
today I'm with roughly can flip the two

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,160
genetic counselors who are deeply

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,710
engaged in PDP 3.0 a project to enhance

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,680
the efficiency and effectiveness of gia

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,890
Nestle policy development process

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,269
welcome

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:26,880
so Rafiq we heard that PP 3.0 aims to

9
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:29,070
introduce some changes improvements to

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,529
how the community can get involved in

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,130
Gina's working groups Kennedy bled some

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:39,000
examples thanks Ari so in terms it's

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,920
more their improvement to help more

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,680
participation the working group and to

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,750
keep them effective so what we have

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,379
there are several area where we try to

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,590
work on one of them is to to have a kind

18
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,500
of statement of participation to set the

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,719
expectation and kind of rules and

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,210
standard of behavior from those who are

21
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:05,090
participating in the working group and

22
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:08,610
then we have skills guide is to help

23
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:11,640
whoever want to be involved in PDP

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,729
working group to understand what kind of

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,920
skills or expectation they we are

26
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:22,110
looking for to participate effectively

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,740
in those PDP and on another hand we try

28
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,570
to work and provide more alternative

29
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,979
than just having a working group as a

30
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:34,579
default structure for a PDP and

31
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:39,030
exploring different ways based on

32
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:41,369
experience like the a PDP team itself or

33
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,920
also learning from the experience that

34
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,720
cross-community working group so there

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,759
are a lot of commonalities between those

36
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,770
alternative model well the the

37
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,960
differences about the representation and

38
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,759
how the different is so and AC they can

39
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,179
participate so they can still

40
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,030
participate but the selection of those

41
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,420
alternate alternative model will be

42
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,628
based on more the needs and what is

43
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,550
necessary for a PDP thank you for

44
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:12,510
providing me Statehouse we look forward

45
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,050
to how

46
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:19,470
it implements eventually so Philips we

47
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,750
know that in Aegina so the gTLD policies

48
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,150
are developed via consensus but

49
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,980
sometimes there may be a performance

50
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,950
issue of someone in the working group a

51
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,480
member may feel not being heard or may

52
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,250
disagree with the decision of the

53
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,069
working group is there a mechanism to

54
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,890
address that Thank You areola

55
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,859
actually yes there is and that's in the

56
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:43,440
guidelines the general guidelines there

57
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,810
are an annex to the genesis of operating

58
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,670
procedures and there is a specific

59
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,940
section three-point-seven in the

60
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:54,420
guidelines that covers the process the

61
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:57,930
mechanism to address a disagreement of a

62
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:01,170
working group member and the PDP 3.0

63
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:04,709
team has been working on enhancing the

64
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,470
process the team has improved the

65
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:10,650
language and and it's important that if

66
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,959
and when the three-point-seven process

67
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,870
is started it doesn't stop the ongoing

68
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,880
work of a working group that's a very

69
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,180
important as you said is there any

70
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:24,329
specific criteria for a filing a

71
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,549
complaint regarding a disagreement there

72
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,849
are three grounds on which a complaint

73
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:32,730
can be filed a working group member can

74
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:34,950
be of the opinion that its contribution

75
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:39,060
has been systematically ignored or

76
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:41,849
discounted it can question appeal a

77
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,459
decision of the working group and it can

78
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:46,380
be of the opinion that someone in the

79
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:50,880
working group has not been performing

80
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:54,269
its role appropriately the improvements

81
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,269
that are prepared by the PDP 3.0 team

82
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:58,889
they provide some guidelines and the

83
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:02,760
guidelines are for the working group

84
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:06,530
members and for the leadership so for

85
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,810
the members they contain some

86
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:14,040
requirements and for the leadership they

87
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:17,280
are actually allowed to refuse to reject

88
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,159
a complaint because the complaint does

89
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,700
not address the requirements and a

90
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,370
couple of examples of requirements or as

91
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:28,670
must be success it must be filed in time

92
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,720
and it must be recognized by other

93
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,150
people

94
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,810
they must recognize the circumstances

95
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:37,489
that give rise to the complaint can you

96
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,280
give us a little bit more detail how the

97
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,780
process goes when a complaint is filed

98
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:47,330
at the working group leadership is

99
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:51,260
informed but also the liaison and they

100
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:54,409
will set up a complaint committee that

101
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:57,170
is composed of GN azo counselors and it

102
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,990
will be their first task to address the

103
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:02,120
disagreement and try to bring it to a

104
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,850
resolution and if they are not

105
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:09,730
successful they can escalate the

106
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:12,470
disagreement to Jeana so leadership and

107
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:15,920
the leadership will then have the task

108
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:19,010
to facilitate the discussions with a

109
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,050
view to coming to a resolution but a

110
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:25,039
member can always bring the matter to

111
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:28,820
the ombudsman afterwards thank you for

112
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:31,760
all these details and so Rafiq back to

113
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:35,360
you if the gene that I can community

114
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,450
want to learn more about PDP 3.0 do they

115
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,330
have an opportunity to do that yes for

116
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:45,099
sure so the team is continuing to work

117
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:47,690
on the improvements and we already

118
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,150
communicated to the different general

119
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:54,170
tso stakeholder group and constituency

120
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,750
asking for their input and to expecting

121
00:05:54,170 --> 00:06:01,400
that to happen through their cancer as a

122
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:06,080
reason and also because we send letters

123
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:09,380
to the Esso and ACS asking thier

124
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,810
feedback about the specific improvement

125
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,560
we believe that they they are impacting

126
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:19,130
them directly and we want to know their

127
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:23,990
opinion and what what we we should

128
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:26,030
revise there so the deadline if the 22nd

129
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,700
of November and we are really looking

130
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,820
forward whose comment because that will

131
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:34,280
help the team to revise and to make any

132
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,750
needed changes and the improvement we

133
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,719
see that as continuous improve

134
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:42,800
and we will continue to to make any

135
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:48,290
immediate adjustment on another hand we

136
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,840
have we will have a public webinar in

137
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:55,160
the 27th of November we will send more

138
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:58,099
details on timely manner and that it

139
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,990
will be an opportunity to present the

140
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:04,100
implementation and improvement and

141
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:07,600
explain to the community we we are

142
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:11,060
trying to hear to be open to all even we

143
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,370
first we want the incoming councillor to

144
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,290
catch up and to be in board for the work

145
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:18,320
to be done but this is really for the

146
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:21,680
whole community to join that webinar and

147
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,530
to see to get that presentation and

148
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,470
explanation about the improvement and

149
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:29,390
the way to help them to to give their

150
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:32,240
feedback and input so we will continue

151
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:36,020
that and probably will explore if there

152
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,050
is any need to see other venue to get

153
