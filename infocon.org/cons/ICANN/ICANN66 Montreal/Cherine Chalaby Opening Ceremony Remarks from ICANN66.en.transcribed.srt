00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:33,299

6:30 p.m. for a special event to

28
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:53,899
celebrate taric's life I invite you all

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,899
to join us for this event

30
00:01:54,649 --> 00:02:05,030
Tariq died just over a month ago at the

31
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:08,509
young age of 57 he was my good friend

32
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:11,970
really one of a kind

33
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:16,530
he always made time for me always

34
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:17,550
encouraged me and always advised me with

35
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,470
great sincerity

36
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:27,270
I can't adequately do justice to how

37
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:31,079
remarkable Tariq was perhaps the best

38
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:33,390
way is to recount the very few of the

39
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:38,820
hundreds of eulogies that have been

40
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:43,880
written about him many euro G's touch

41
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:47,850
upon his generosity of spirit hero son

42
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:50,100
Tariq had a unique ability to bring

43
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:53,430
people together and forget our

44
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:59,160
differences I think the reason for that

45
00:02:53,430 --> 00:03:02,000
was his big heart during tough times he

46
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,680
was in some ways like a real doctor

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,800
always ready to listen to someone's

48
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:12,360
issues and always ready to suggest a

49
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,910
treatment for a problem I wish we all

50
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:20,070
listen more and try to help

51
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:22,590
just like Tariq did Tariq touched the

52
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:27,140
lives of many people with his amazing

53
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:31,440
humbleness and selfless friendship

54
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:36,390
perhaps the most poignant eulogies tell

55
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:40,290
us about the private man Tariq was a

56
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:43,040
quiet giant much like the pyramids of

57
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,040
his birthplace

58
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:50,580
he showed incredible bravery in fighting

59
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:53,210
against his illness and even while in

60
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:58,820
the worst of it he was devoted to I can

61
00:03:53,210 --> 00:04:04,860
until the very end and most importantly

62
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:08,420
Tariq lived for his family the dedicated

63
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,420
husband and father

64
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:20,798
who fought so hard for so long to stay

65
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:22,740
with them we are truly fortunate to have

66
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:27,640
had Tariq as a member of our community

67
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:33,300
for almost two decades sadly he left us

68
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,300
too early a great man a great loss

69
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:39,610
farewell my good friend or as they say

70
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,940
in the land of the Nile and where they

71
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,750
are

72
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:47,290
he also deeply Allah sees ladies and

73
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,720
gentlemen may I respectfully ask you to

74
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:53,940
stand for a moment of silence in memory

75
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,940
of Tareq and on

76
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:21,470
[Applause]

77
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:30,080
I'm sure you all know this is my final

78
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:32,900
public meeting as I can share and I'm

79
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:37,219
honored and delighted to speak to you

80
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:39,440
today albeit for the last time I will

81
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,780
retire at the end of this week and will

82
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,130
fly home with many wonderful memories

83
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:48,830
and a great sense of achievement at the

84
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:53,600
beginning of my tenure as chair in

85
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:58,520
November 2017 the board and I set our

86
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,620
sights on icons future in particular we

87
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,409
worked with our community and I can Org

88
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:08,780
on the development of three critical

89
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:12,320
plans to define that future since then

90
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:15,020
at every ICANN meeting I have reported

91
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:18,469
to you our collective progress on these

92
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:21,049
plans hence before I hand over to my

93
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:25,940
successor I would like to share with you

94
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:28,670
our latest successes firstly I am

95
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:32,510
pleased to report that the new icons

96
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:36,200
strategic plan for fiscal years 2021 to

97
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:40,789
2025 has been formally adopted by the

98
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:43,670
board secondly the new operating and

99
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:46,400
financial plan for the same fiscal years

100
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:49,750
has been developed and will be published

101
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,810
for public comment in December 2019 as

102
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:57,730
agreed it will show that our strategic

103
00:06:53,810 --> 00:07:01,100
plan is realistic and affordable

104
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:03,800
lastly the work plan to improve the

105
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,350
effectiveness of icons multi-stakeholder

106
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:11,150
model is also scheduled to be published

107
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:13,340
in December 2019 for public comment it

108
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,700
will list the issues identified by our

109
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:20,239
community and suggested approaches for

110
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:23,840
addressing them over the five-year

111
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,720
period of the strategic plan at this

112
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,229
stage I wish to emphasize we are not

113
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,750
looking for solutions but rather

114
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:34,490
approaches

115
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:38,430
that will eventually lead to solutions

116
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:42,240
these three plans are comprehensive and

117
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:46,700
far-reaching and there are no barriers

118
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:50,120
to their successful implementation a

119
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:55,250
remarkable achievement by all of us

120
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,250
icons future is therefore in our hands

121
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:04,170
Mahatma Gandhi once said the future

122
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:06,570
depends on what we do in the present so

123
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:10,710
let's take a moment to assess how I can

124
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:13,770
is doing at present three years after

125
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:17,370
the IANA stewardship transition in

126
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:21,659
particular is I can fulfilling the

127
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:24,960
transition promise and is it functioning

128
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:27,110
as a mature cooperation capable of

129
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,409
tackling its external and internal

130
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:35,339
challenges starting with the transition

131
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:38,640
promise there is no doubt that I can

132
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:40,589
today is upholding and maintaining the

133
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,960
four principles upon which the

134
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:47,940
transition was agreed we are supporting

135
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,970
a multi-stakeholder model and are

136
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,490
working on improving it we are

137
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,770
maintaining the security stability and

138
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:59,580
resilience of the Internet domain name

139
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:01,890
system we are meeting the needs and

140
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:06,330
expectation of the global customers and

141
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:08,790
partners of the IANA services and we

142
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,790
have adopted the new strategic vision of

143
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:14,730
being a champion of the single open and

144
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:17,120
globally interoperable internet and the

145
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:21,570
trusted steward of its unique identifier

146
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,060
because we believe that the internet

147
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,880
must belong to everyone and must remain

148
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:32,609
an engine for innovation and continued

149
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,410
growth economic growth furthermore the

150
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,170
implementation of the bylaw changes

151
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:40,339
stipulated by the transition has ensured

152
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:43,759
that I can remains truly independent

153
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:46,339
and not open to capture and the nine

154
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:49,129
powers given to our community have

155
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:51,610
enhanced ICANN's accountability checks

156
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:55,309
and balances

157
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:57,699
we also made important changes over the

158
00:09:55,309 --> 00:10:00,559
past three years that have strengthened

159
00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:05,689
icons capability and its financial

160
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:08,439
sustainability most notably icons

161
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:11,059
technology is more robust and improving

162
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:16,248
following investments in infrastructure

163
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:19,279
and new applications I can org and the

164
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:22,129
urines leadership is more streamlined

165
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:26,360
better organized and much more service

166
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:29,149
oriented operating expenses are firmly

167
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,639
under control as a result of strong

168
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:34,970
fiscal disciplines applied by management

169
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:37,459
and the board I can funds under

170
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:41,029
management are protected by a sound and

171
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:44,660
strict investment policy and the reserve

172
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:47,959
fund has increased considerably to 85 %

173
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,819
of its target thanks to one-time

174
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:52,219
significant contribution from the

175
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:54,949
auction proceeds and higher than planned

176
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,189
annual contributions from operational

177
00:10:54,949 --> 00:11:00,319
savings

178
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:02,480
additionally the board implemented

179
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:05,059
significant improvements to its

180
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,689
operational effectiveness transparency

181
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:12,199
and succession planning and the transfer

182
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:15,079
of responsibilities from myself to

183
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:18,378
martin bottom on has happened in a

184
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:21,290
smooth and assured way just as it did

185
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:28,220
two years ago when I succeeded Steve

186
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:32,480
Crocker all of these are hallmarks of a

187
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:35,269
mature privately led I can with the

188
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:41,300
necessary safeguards for its continued

189
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:45,019
success and independence this level of

190
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:47,599
maturity that I can has attained gives

191
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:49,860
us the fortitude to face the

192
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,740
uncertainties of the future

193
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:56,700
and the resolve to address our internal

194
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:59,339
challenges with regard to the

195
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:02,430
uncertainties of the future we

196
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:04,950
acknowledge that in the next five years

197
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:09,810
ICANN will face more external challenges

198
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:12,630
than ever before such as the exponential

199
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,660
growth in security threats and the

200
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:19,079
increasing risks of internet

201
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:22,620
fragmentation but we have developed a

202
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:25,380
bold and decisive strategic plan that

203
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:29,300
responds to these challenges so that we

204
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:32,459
can take ICANN where we want it to be as

205
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:35,040
for the internal challenges we

206
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:39,180
acknowledge that to continue to evolve

207
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:45,149
we must resolve our complex and often

208
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:48,479
conflicting issues such as prioritizing

209
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:54,060
our work to enable us to make optimal

210
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:57,029
use of icons limited resources enhancing

211
00:12:54,060 --> 00:13:00,319
and streamline the large number of ICANN

212
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:02,850
reviews that are conducted each year

213
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,360
addressing abuse to the domain name

214
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:08,550
system developing a new governance

215
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,570
structure for the DNS root service

216
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:15,630
system addressing human rights and anti

217
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:18,120
harassment issues and evolving a

218
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:23,910
multi-stakeholder model as mentioned

219
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:29,070
earlier these tough issues have been put

220
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:31,399
on the back burner for several years if

221
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:34,140
we continue to leave them unattended

222
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:39,029
they could tear into the fabric of our

223
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:43,880
community to resolve them we need to be

224
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:47,699
open to new ways ideas and thoughts

225
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:50,130
mistakes will undoubtedly happen but

226
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:55,109
mistakes are a proof that we are trying

227
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:59,610
and without trying progress may never be

228
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:02,220
made we're all in it together what makes

229
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,190
us strong is that we keep face in each

230
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:09,190
other

231
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:11,530
and trust our own compass another sign

232
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:15,760
of our strengths is that we acknowledge

233
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:18,490
that our public role and public records

234
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:22,660
are quite rightly subject to public

235
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:26,700
scrutiny we understand the importance of

236
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:29,890
the scrutiny accept it and learn from it

237
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:33,070
the future therefore bodes well for I

238
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:35,380
can because it has a stable and solid

239
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:41,290
platform from which to carry out its new

240
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:43,210
vision and strategic plan and when

241
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:47,829
looking to the future we must never

242
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:51,790
forget that icons legitimacy and its

243
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:55,990
grant of authority come from our global

244
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:58,360
multi-stakeholder community and from the

245
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:01,060
commitment of this community to come

246
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:04,000
together to develop and be bound by

247
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:09,510
consensus policies within icons mission

248
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:13,270
a multi-stakeholder model is special I

249
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:15,520
wholeheartedly believe in it as a model

250
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:18,370
of governance collaboration and

251
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,760
consensus building the model that

252
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:26,440
empowers our stakeholders from all over

253
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:31,000
the world because it has no borders no

254
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:34,030
centralized power and no kill switch it

255
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,610
served us well for the past 20 or 21

256
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:40,449
years and will continue to do so in

257
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:44,890
years to come our community is also

258
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:48,160
special a diverse community comprised of

259
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:51,790
people who are motivated by their

260
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,640
commitment to do the public good and by

261
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:57,339
their duty to do what they believe is

262
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:02,350
right for the billions of Internet users

263
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:05,500
and future generations I consider myself

264
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,630
a very lucky person to have had the

265
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:12,580
opportunity to be part of this community

266
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:14,080
and serve the global public interest it

267
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:17,410
is that belief

268
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:20,310
and that opportunity to serve that drove

269
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:23,680
me throughout my time on the board

270
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:26,800
working was I can allow me to give

271
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,670
something back it reinforced my belief

272
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:36,130
and my conviction that giving is far

273
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:39,550
more important than taking in his book

274
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:45,540
entitled the Prophet the world-renowned

275
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:45,540
Lebanese poet Gibran Khalil Gibran wrote

276
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:53,110
you give but little when you give of

277
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:58,480
your possessions it is when you give of

278
00:16:53,110 --> 00:17:02,200
yourself that you truly give in that

279
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:05,079
spirit I hope simply to leave you with a

280
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:08,500
few thoughts to think about as you look

281
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:13,530
to the future to my colleagues on the

282
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:16,950
board you are ready for what lies ahead

283
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:19,569
remain strategic and forward-thinking

284
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:22,810
continue to build a transparent

285
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:26,369
relationship with our community and be

286
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:29,620
its trusted and reliable partner and

287
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:34,120
always remember that it is the character

288
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:36,879
we have the values we uphold and the

289
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:42,669
ways we support each other that makes us

290
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:46,630
a united and collegial board too I can

291
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:49,570
orc without you our strategies and

292
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:54,180
dreams can never become a reality

293
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:54,179
your role is to serve the community

294
00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:00,610
support the board and above all ensure I

295
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:04,390
can meet all its legal financial and

296
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:07,419
fiduciary responsibilities continue to

297
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:10,180
do so with integrity objectivity and a

298
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:14,440
commitment to quality and to our

299
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:19,240
community progress is not possible

300
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:21,430
without change do not hesitate to evolve

301
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,150
a multi-stakeholder model working

302
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:26,710
closely with the board and I can org

303
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:29,650
break down the silos

304
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:33,640
treat each other and staff with respect

305
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:34,690
and professionalism and ensure you work

306

318

listening remotely so I'm told

343
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:47,408
I did not envisage the commitment I made

344
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:48,039
nine years ago to be as extensive as it

345
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:51,399
has been

346
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:54,220
I appreciate the sacrifices my family

347
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:57,879
made without your love and support I

348
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:04,119
could not I could not have done this job

349
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:06,369
that I have so much enjoyed the past

350
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:09,009
nine years have been the greatest

351
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:13,238
