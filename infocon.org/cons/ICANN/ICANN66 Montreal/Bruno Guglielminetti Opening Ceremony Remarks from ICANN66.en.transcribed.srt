59
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,890
accuracy and that's the good news so far

60
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,470
I have talked about great things that

61
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,319
you can send Montreal but I don't want

62
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:11,400
to forget Quebec City it was mentioned

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,060
or governament and by the way if you are

68
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:30,390
ever looking for a new location to store

69
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:33,510
a data a secure place with several fire

70
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,230
and cost effective are available in

71
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,298
Quebec

72
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,858
you should think about the province of

73
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,410
Quebec where you will find great

74
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:45,630
opportunity because of our abundance of

75
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:49,019
electricity and also cold weather but

76
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:52,310
it's out of the year the rest is working

77
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:55,019
on the machine and based on electricity

78
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:58,859
it's like if Quebec was created to our

79
00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,930
vast data center this which you have a

80
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:01,500
lot of work in front of you to name a

81
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,930
few

82
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,350
I'm thinking about obviously unified

83
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:11,280
access model DNS abuse and the new route

84
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:13,049
of application for the new TLD say Cabo

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,519
did Farrakhan sits on the committee

86
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:20,400
casita it is against a show the CLI can

87
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,770
so they tell monopoly snail internet the

88
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,250
domain so let me conclude by saying that

89
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,109
I

90
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,610
really hope that you find the time to

91
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,250
network with a member of the Quebec

92
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:33,720
delegation and discover the great

93
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:36,930
resources at partnership that the

94
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,450
province of Quebec has to offer you

95
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,300
while you're here and when you go back

96
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,729
to your country have a great conference

97
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:51,649
in Montreal thank you for attention
