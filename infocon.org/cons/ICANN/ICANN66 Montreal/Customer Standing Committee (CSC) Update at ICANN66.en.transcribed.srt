2
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:10,200
I'm here in ICANN 66 in Montreal Canada

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,149
with byron Holland chair of the

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,149
inaugural customer Standing Committee or

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,160
CSC Byron you've been chair the CSC

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,470
since 2016 how would you describe its

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,660
role and what does it do

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:24,750
well the CSC is primary role and it has

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,789
a very specific mission is to ensure the

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,429
satisfactory performance of the IANA

11
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,099
functions on behalf of its primary

12
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,620
customers the top-level domain operators

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:37,290
be they the generics or the country code

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,610
operators so it's my machine the CSE has

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,750
been really quite successful in

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,469
performing this role what do you

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,090
consider to be its major successes I

18
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:47,160
think it has been quite successful in

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,870
executing its responsibilities and I've

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,819
been on a number of different working

21
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,160
groups over the years so I have some

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,690
frame of reference I think one of the

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,550
things that is really important is it

24
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,989
has a very specific mission and you

25
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,519
could literally go to the Charter and

26
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,559
look at the mission and understand that

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,500
it's very clear it's well written it's

28
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,149
narrow and it doesn't allow for a lot of

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,460
room for interpretation so we had a

30
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,830
really well understood goal and I think

31
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,259
that was the first thing the other thing

32
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,600
is that the communities that put forward

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,880
members look forward a very small number

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,039
only to from the generics to from the

35
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,380
country codes and they were put forward

36
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,689
based on their technical skills and

37
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,070
understanding of the space and I would

38
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,408
say they're connective tissue to the

39
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,729
community - I can't understanding how I

40
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:34,229
can works so we had common goal we had a

41
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,840
small number of members who really

42
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,060
understood the space and we were really

43
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,979
committed to doing the work because it

44
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,869
was also very much in our own interest

45
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,700
to ensure the healthy high performance

46
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,970
in your view what have been the major

47
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,560
factors that led to its success I think

48
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,939
to begin with it was the clarity of the

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,770
mission so if you actually go to the

50
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,429
Charter for the committee

51
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,560
it's very clear very narrow and very

52
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,450
specific so we all clearly understood

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,780
the goal the two different communities

54
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,820
that put members on the committee the

55
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,250
register stakeholder group and the CNS

56
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,810
so each put two members on and they were

57
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,580
very specifically selected for their

58
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,590
technical knowledge their their deep

59
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,989
knowledge of the space and a deep

60
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,000
knowledge of ICANN and the inner

61
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:20,550
workings of I can sort of the connective

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,040
tissue of it if you will so between the

63
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,590
clarity of mission and the depth of

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,829
expertise of the small number of members

65
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,260
that set up I think an environment where

66
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,380
they could really work together to

67
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,780
achieve that common goal do you foresee

68
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,540
any major changes I don't foresee any

69
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,180
major changes in the near term the first

70
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,070
three years of the CSC we spend a fair

71
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,290
amount of time bootstrapping up our own

72
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,690
procedures internal rules and procedures

73
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:52,230
as well as some of the major procedures

74
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:54,510
for the CSC should something happen that

75
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,119
requires our various escalation paths

76
00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:00,230
now that those have been set in place I

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,459
believe it will be steady state business

78
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,140
for the near future at the very least

79
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,299
well thanks so much for joining me today

80
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,279
and give us some more insight into the

81
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:11,010
roles and the successes of the CSC I

82
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,989
think the CSC has been successful in

83
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,480
working with Diana and that is really

84
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:18,630
that the fundamentally important thing

85
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,280
can a CSC which provides the oversight

86
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,709
function for the healthy high

87
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,930
performance

88
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:26,599
functions can we work together

89
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,030
effectively with PTI who delivers the

90
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:32,260
services and initially I think there was

91
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:35,359
perhaps an anxiety on PTI side change

92
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,310
new oversight mechanism reasonable

93
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:38,329
anxiety but we spent a lot of time

94
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,120
making sure that that relationship

95
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:43,700
worked well and it really is working

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,319
well now well Byron thanks so much for

97
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,689
joining me again and again giving us

98
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,549
some more insight into CSC thank you

99
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:55,989
very much

100
