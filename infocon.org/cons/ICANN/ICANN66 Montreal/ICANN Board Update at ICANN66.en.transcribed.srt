[Music]

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,230
I'm here at ICANN 66 in Montreal Canada

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,040
with former Board Chair Shireen Shalaby

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,440
and current Board Chair martin butterman

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,630
welcome the first question I have

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,510
Shireen you've been on the ICANN board

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,340
for nine years and you've gone through

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,710
some of the most important moments in I

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,570
can't history what are some of the

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,230
issues that you think as Martin takes on

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:34,530
his role that he'll face well these are

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,649
issues that have been going on for quite

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,320
a while and I think the time has come

14
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,840
now to resolve them the biggest one is

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,390
the evolution of our multi-stakeholder

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,520
model this is a promise we made as part

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,800
of the transition and we have to fulfill

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,079
that promise the second one is

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,180
undoubtedly prioritizing our work

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,699
because I can has limited resources

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,440
there's a lot of work to be done and we

22
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,960
need to have some prioritization of that

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,009
the third one in my view is the

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,750
streamlining and enhancing all of the

25
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,780
large number of reviews that take every

26
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,920
year and we need to really work on those

27
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,580
after that there's a series of things

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,400
that are typical of an organization that

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,830
of our size things like human rights

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,680
issues things like anti harassment

31
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:27,408
issues things like defining a framework

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,340
for our public the public interest and

33
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:32,640
there's a couple of things that have

34
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,220
recently come up to light one of them is

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,750
the governance structure new governance

36
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,479
structure for our route server operator

37
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,700
that's that's very key and of course we

38
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,170
have to continue our work with gdpr

39
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,229
that's quite important

40
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,860
Martin those are a lot of different

41
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:51,630
topics and big topics to focus on so

42
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,039
what will your leadership style be and

43
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,329
and how will you approach it yeah well

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,399
fortunately I've been working with

45
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,350
Shireen for some time which helps me to

46
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,450
get up to speed and we have this

47
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,850
strategic plan which will help us to set

48
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,929
our priorities and align with the

49
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:13,109
community on our way forward my style of

50
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,540
working is mainly a team player style I

51
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,849
am

52
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,569
team player I would consider myself a

53
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:21,670
servant leader in many ways and with the

54
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,890
board I want to be that team but that

55
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,589
team needs to extend towards the entire

56
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:30,399
community and I would see orc to be an

57
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:32,379
important part in that team yes sure in

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,500
looking back on your time on the board

59
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:39,819
are there any issues that you wish you

60
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:42,220
could have reached consensus on not

61
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:45,750
really I mean these issues have just

62
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:49,269
mentioned to you our issues we all know

63
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,310
but there has been over the nine years

64
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:54,250
I've been on the board always one make

65
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:57,310
meta issue that dominated our thinking

66
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,450
first was the launch of new gTLDs that

67
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,090
took a number of years

68
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,980
no sooner we stopped we then went into

69
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,760
the transition which took two or three

70
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,349
years to get ready

71
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,470
no sooner we stopped then we went to

72
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:12,189
gdpr and all of those are really top

73
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:14,530
priorities so now the time has come and

74
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:17,230
we can't leave these for much longer

75
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,879
because they are the type of issues that

76
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,040
as you leave them and as they become

77
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,739
more complex they tear into the fabric

78
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,750
of our community so it is our

79
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:27,900
responsibilities now to treat them as a

80
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,370
priority yes indeed

81
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,729
sure you brought significant business

82
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:36,940
acumen to your role and Martin you do as

83
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:39,760
well having served on a board and also

84
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:42,010
serving as a CEO how do you think that

85
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,060
background will serve you as you come

86
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:49,478
into this thanks to that I've also spent

87
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,819
many years as an analyst and policy

88
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,159
advisor above for the European

89
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:57,839
Commission and and also for rent

90
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,819
corporation and and independently later

91
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,120
particularly see how technology touches

92
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:06,488
our society and how we can do best with

93
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,790
that so that provides a kind of broad

94
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:12,340
deep knowledge base or experience base

95
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:15,310
this will help me to frame the

96
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:18,728
activities that we're doing very well

97
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:21,339
and my earlier engagement Vista

98
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:23,169
community all different levels as a

99
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,840
registry

100
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:29,560
a support of CAC but also with the

101
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,260
technical community helps me to have a

102
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,000
good feel for the overall thing and we

103
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,980
need to make this together so it's very

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,620
good I think that from a clearly

105
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:45,340
independent position I can bring this

106
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,020
leadership with these backgrounds it

107
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,630
will place so well into your your

108
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,580
intention of team or the team approach

109
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,409
right as you see all of the sides of it

110
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,210
I've had the opportunity to work for

111
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,490
many years with people or and their

112
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,799
field much more brilliant than I am so

113
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,020
I've been learning to team up with

114
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,960
people that can bring a lot to the table

115
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:08,169
in the full expectation that what they

116
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,960
have to offer has value and this is true

117
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:13,210
here in our community too and I would

118
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,180
say something to that that's okay yes

119
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,450
and what what the community what the

120
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:21,210
world wants to see is a stable

121
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:23,789
succession planning within icon yes and

122
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,560
when I succeeded Steve Crocker

123
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:29,560
the succession was really very smooth

124
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,250
and a short and Martin I have worked

125
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,720
together for the last few years and you

126
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,880
have seen and the community has seen

127
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,520
that the succession from myself to

128
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,659
Martin has also being very smooth and a

129
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,580
short and you know we have the same

130
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,550
ethos the same values the same way of

131
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,620
thinking and I think that is important

132
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,290
because providing that stability is key

133
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,840
for the success of the board and for the

134
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:58,270
community to feel comfortable where is a

135
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,640
newer generation of leaders going from

136
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,950
one to the other without having causing

137
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,530
any disruption so that's that's and I'm

138
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:07,270
absolutely sure a lot and will be a very

139
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,820
very good leader and will continue on

140
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,620
the path we've worked together for the

141
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,960
last two or three years Shareen a

142
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,810
question for you during your first

143
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,609
speech as chair when you were in San

144
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,290
Juan you said that the board is

145
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,200
committed to serving the community as a

146
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,640
reliable and trusted partner do you feel

147
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,070
like you've made progress on that goal

148
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,919
during your time as chair I really do I

149
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:33,040
really do and if you see in my opening

150
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,780
remarks I told the board to continue on

151
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,050
that path because that's very important

152
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,880
and it's not just a sentence it means a

153
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,850
lot of things it means number one that

154
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,830
we have to align our priorities as a

155
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:47,020
board with the priority of the community

156
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,390
no point the board in one direction

157
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,490
community another because otherwise they

158
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:55,719
won't trust us second thing we have to

159
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:58,000
be very professional very consistent and

160
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,320
very predictable that's what they want

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,620
from us they don't want us to make a

162
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,750
decision one day under certain criteria

163
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,490
and then a similar decision for us to

164
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,140
change the name of the game so that's

165
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,490
what I have to do the second thing is

166
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,590
the third thing we have to be very

167
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,020
transparent the community likes

168
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:16,359
transparency they want to know how we're

169
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,890
thinking what decisions we've made what

170
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,500
the rationale for making those decisions

171
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,659
but the most important thing in addition

172
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,040
to all this is that we act in the

173
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,070
collective interest of all stakeholders

174
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,170
and every board member that comes on the

175
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,540
board must not act in the interest of

176
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:34,150
the stakeholder that appointed them and

177
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,950
this is in the virals we have to act in

178
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,770
the collective interest of all of our

179
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,659
stakeholders so I think we've made

180
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:44,530
progress on all of those but you know

181
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,760
what this is not a score of 10 out of 10

182
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,609
or 9 out of 10

183
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,380
this is just a continuing process and we

184
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,900
can't stop because the day you stop

185
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,969
performing on all these things you drop

186
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,030
you completely drop me I lose the trust

187
00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:00,460
so it's an ongoing process I can evolve

188
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:02,710
and the board has to evolve and the to

189
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:07,630
evolves together so I think that goes in

190
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:09,159
10 there's a continuum with that in mind

191
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:13,000
though Martin when you and I sit down at

192
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:16,540
the end of your turn how will you gauge

193
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,300
your success well first the most

194
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,580
importantly is that this all works the

195
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,010
internet works and I often start my

196
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,780
speeches with the internet works and now

197
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:29,620
we're going to take talk about all it

198
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:31,450
takes to keep it working in that age

199
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:35,140
space which is much bigger than I can

200
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:37,210
alone I can should have that role of

201
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,400
that trusted Stuart should be the go-to

202
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:42,849
place also for people from outside of

203
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:45,220
ICANN to come to make help make sure

204
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:47,150
that this one internet continues to

205
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,000
serve the world and

206
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,920
I can and the board I think the board

207
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,410
should be seen as that trusted partner

208
00:08:51,920 --> 00:09:00,199
and transparency as serene set is

209
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:02,689
crucial and that also the process will

210
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,700
be put in place to be more transparent

211
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,250
on what our priorities are what we think

212
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,890
we need to do and in that to serve the

213
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,680
community I think this is something we

214
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,990
can build on towards the future so with

215
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,229
that I hope that at the end they will

216
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:20,300
say he served well because that will be

217
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,360
the role so you're gonna start every

218
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,779
speech by saying the internet works I

219
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,310
like that

220
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:26,870
why didn't you tell me that two years

221
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:33,680
ago but I've used it myself

222
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:36,440
