2
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:12,750
so Shireen I can't speak Arabic but in

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:17,520
pig latin its ulti month it's all team a

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:23,340
a a multi may stakeholders stay ethos

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:26,698
may award made so for those of you who

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,529
think that Americans don't get irony the

7
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,670
irony of me receiving this award is not

8
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,170
lost on me

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,969
I feel like someone that's been awarded

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:45,649
the Purple Heart for shooting himself in

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:45,649
the foot it's a joke on many levels so

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,620
even but even more so in my case you

13
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,230
know this award is really born on the

14
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,559
back of others first from the myth the

15
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:01,440
amazing staff work that is necessary for

16
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:07,408
every success that I can has in its

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:10,610
policy development but but also yes but

18
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,510
but also in many individual

19
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,270
communications I received from the

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,990
community so one-on-one emails that said

21
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,789
you did a good job today Kurt or you

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,798
showed some real leadership today or

23
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,990
someone even not in the group saying

24
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,930
that was a really good email and I think

25
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,009
you know mutual understanding and mutual

26
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:36,360
communication is also part of

27
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:39,030
multi-stakeholder but not just in in in

28
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,890
the near term but I think to a certain

29
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,750
extent or ICANN meetings had become

30
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,670
routinized you know I think we've talked

31
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,299
about geographic names for the last 30

32
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:51,380
meetings so far so I think you know in

33
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,189
my in my case you know this

34
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,530
multistakeholderism really goes back to

35
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,719
to first principles you know I learned

36
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,520
about the bottom up model at the knee of

37
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,439
Vint Cerf so how good is that

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,560
and there were board members that you

39
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,220
might have not

40
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,190
no nerve or forgotten like Tom Niles or

41
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:11,260
Yvonne Capo's or Hagen halter or old

42
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,700
Harold Alva strand I saw him over there

43
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:18,489
over there

44
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:20,589
hey how and and people who really got

45
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:22,450
the big picture that we weren't just

46
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,880
solving individual problems but we were

47
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,209
solving in the moon away that tried to

48
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:31,810
make this multi-stakeholder experiment

49
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:34,000
survive and actually thrive and then

50
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:37,470
there were members of the community also

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,150
that really helped me out so there were

52
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,190
registrar's that were transitioning the

53
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,650
business out of their garages into the

54
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,109
global enterprises they have they are

55
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:50,560
now that were that were very free in

56
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,970
their in their information and you know

57
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,830
I won't give you their names but I can

58
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,660
show you the scars I have from those

59
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,900
communications I got to work with the

60
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:01,239
founders of our various organizations so

61
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:05,019
Paul to me was the first chair of the

62
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:07,390
GAC and Christa Spain initiated the G

63
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:09,910
NSO and Bruce Tonkin if he didn't start

64
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,578
the G NSO he made it effective and those

65
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:15,100
guys didn't advocate on behalf of their

66
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:17,049
organizations they advocated the

67
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,880
multi-stakeholder model to their

68
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:20,920
organizations to tell them what role

69
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,440
they would play how they were limited

70
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:27,220
but how they could also participate so

71
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,130
this could all work out and then there's

72
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,769
a couple individual law comments I call

73
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,769
outs I want to make you know I work

74
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:39,190
closely with several community members

75
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:41,859
one is Marilyn Cade who constantly

76
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:45,010
lectured and cajoled and mentored and

77
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:48,190
admonished and yelled at me about how to

78
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,989
act in the multi-stakeholder model in a

79
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,060
way that everything so that everything

80
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:53,980
came out of my mouth was really in

81
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,190
furtherance of that I'm almost done in

82
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:00,340
the back so if the multi-stakeholder

83
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,930
award was born with ICANN I think

84
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,350
Marilyn would have won at four times by

85
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,840
now

86
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:10,090
and I want to thank my beautiful Amy

87
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,690
disarmingly amiable but scaring Lee

88
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,150
Intel

89
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,170
wife Donna who's been a constant member

90
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:22,108
for

91
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:23,909
[Applause]

92
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,520
so as you know it's quite a

93
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:28,938
Shakespearean story but I won't say the

94
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,669
number of years but Donna has worked

95
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:36,389
with the leadership of the GAC the CC

96
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:39,000
NSO the G NSO the ICANN executive she

97
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,569
knows more about the interests

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,979
interaction integration worries wants of

99
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:46,620
each of the members of the community

100
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:48,870
more than anybody in this room are on

101
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,389
the planet and if you need to solve a

102
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,180
problem Donna's probably the best place

103
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,449
for that so Sheree now if are you still

104
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,969
here

105
00:04:54,449 --> 00:05:00,599
yeah so I'll and if I can remember and

106
00:04:56,969 --> 00:05:01,800
I'll end with a quote from Plato who

107
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:05,699
would have thought we'd have this in

108
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,599
common right so so he said be kind

109
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:11,789
everybody you meet is fighting

110
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:15,539
incredibly hard battles and and what

111
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:17,310
that means is well what that means is

112
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:19,020
everybody is dealing with this

113
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,979
incredible you know I promised I

114
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,990
wouldn't say the word but

115
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:24,539
everybody's dealing with this incredible

116
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,550
pile of stuff every day you know someone

117
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:28,680
got on a plane flew halfway across the

118
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,080
world to be here on a flight that was

119
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,270
late and different from the luggage that

120
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,818
was checked in her name and then she

121
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,729
came here to make certain arguments or

122
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:40,349
points known and she wasn't really an

123
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:42,389
agreement with her boss and her bosses

124
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:44,669
this misogynist guy that's holding her

125
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:47,129
back from a promotion and she's not sure

126
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:48,539
her stakeholder group is across it but

127
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:50,849
she sure that when she makes a

128
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:53,270
compromise they'll find fault for her

129
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:55,469
for it her partner is back home

130
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:58,198
overwhelmed with the kids and managing

131
00:05:55,469 --> 00:06:00,990
the house and wondering why she's taking

132
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,240
these posh business trips and she dare

133
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,979
not send photos of the semi-good in

134
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,900
semi-sweet wine we're about to drink

135
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,729
because that will confirm everyone's

136
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,609
suspicions that this is one great big

137
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:14,250
party and not a lot of work so when this

138
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,900
person says something in a meeting try

139
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,979
to understand the point they're trying

140
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:22,830
to make try to understand with kindness

141
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:24,839
try to reach a position where you can

142
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:28,080
give that person a victory and still

143
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:29,940
achieve your own your own necessities

144
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,459
and while your being here and so that's

145
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,050
why it's important to be kind because

146
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:36,479
everybody's fighting an

147
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,759
hard battle so thank you to whoever

148
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,979
nominated me and to those who considered

149
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,699
my nomination thanks for staying so late

150
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,699
have a great rest
