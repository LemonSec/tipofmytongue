Afflalo has been but continuously

26
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:17,799
participating in the multi stakeholder

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:22,479
model process through a lakh meetings

28
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:25,780
through working groups through icon

29
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:28,329
international meetings bringing

30
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:31,180
different stakeholders from the regions

31
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:35,320
whenever I can meetings are organized

32
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:38,740
within Africa and most importantly is

33
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:45,100
that within we've started this since I

34
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:49,419
think 2010 for every ICANN meeting a

35
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:52,298
Frollo will think about you know the

36
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:57,009
most important issue at the moment and

37
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:59,619
make statements based on the challenges

38
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:01,509
we have within the region based on the

39
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,570
opportunities we have within the regions

40
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:09,908
and to formulate recommendations for the

41
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:12,489
board this time for I can 65 the Africa

42
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:17,379
community worked very hard on the

43
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:19,840
multi-stakeholder models showing what

44
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:22,450
the opportunities are showing the

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,670
challenges we have and making key

46
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,950
recommendations and you know what is

47
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:30,790
important is this in this is that this

48
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:33,339
is our unique way of participating in

49
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,140
the policy development of icon on icon

50
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:40,870
issues mainly on the multi-stakeholder

51
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:43,208
model and this is also an example for

52
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,310
the other regions because what we are

53
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:48,640
singling out what we were showing is

54
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:51,900
also true for many other regions even

55
00:02:48,640 --> 00:03:00,458
though it these are acute for Africa

56
00:02:51,900 --> 00:03:03,220
these can serve as in inspiring models

57
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:08,170
for the other for the other arrows and I

58
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:11,439
think Africa Africa but it's not only

59
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:16,000
within the the afrinic community but

60
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:19,180
this is open up to all I can community

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,189
within Africa we work together we draft

62
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,090
together we submit together we comment

63
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:27,310
together and we follow up together until

64
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,980
the recommendation make get an answer

65
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,939
from the board thank you thank you so

66
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,488

67
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:34,328

68
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:37,360
Mohammed

71
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:44,018
topics and other accomplishments and how

72
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,659

owing forward thank you very much

74
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:52,810
deserve a further have a unique position

75
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:56,110
because it's the organization that

76
00:03:52,810 --> 00:04:00,430
brings the African users perspective to

77
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:02,819
I can also development process and in

78
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:06,129
order to facilitate this dialogue this

79
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:08,349
bottom-up dialogue with the community we

80
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:14,488
have established a working group that to

81
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:17,560
work on agreeing on a selective policy

82
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:22,120
topics that we see are important for the

83
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:26,440
region and the working group has came up

84
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,600
with about eight or nine hot topics

85
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,630
issues that focus to their to the

86
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,230
Internet users and in African community

87
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:38,170
and the DNS system and I can mission is

88
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:40,690
critical to the operation of the

89
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,720
Internet and to us as end-users how we

90
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:48,250
access the Internet so our community

91
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,410
have selected topics like the security

92
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,880
and privacy of the domain name system

93
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:56,530
and specifically the DNS SEC

94
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,969
implementation in Africa as one of the

95
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:02,500
hot topics our community as well

96
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,900
selected Internet Governance as one of

97
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,180
the hot topics issues and there's lots

98
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,400
of issues about access it might not be

99
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,250
directly relevant to I can but it's

100
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,310
relevant to the African community the

101
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:18,220
issue of diversity and participation

102
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,590
within I can as well as one of the the

103
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,310
hot topics that has been debated a lot

104
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:28,570
in our region so the idea is to bring

105
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:30,940
those topics to I can arena do capacity

106
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,159
building an outreach to our members in

107
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,200
Africa to educate them about those

108
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,580
issues

109
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,500
