hello my name is anima kaneki from I

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,049
can't staff and with me today is

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,480
Kristian hesselman from ICANN security

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,340
stability and Advisory Committee to talk

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,890
about a recent report the ASEC is

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,570
published on DNS and the Internet of

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,640
Things thank you for joining us today

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,369
Christian you bet can you tell us a

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,920
little bit about the SX report on DNS

15
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,050
and the Internet of Things sure the

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,390
title of the report is called the DNS

17
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,449
and the Internet of Things opportunities

18
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:47,660
risks and challenges the number is SEK

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:52,260
105 and we released it early June and

20
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:55,669
the report talks about the IOC and the

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,899
DNS as 2co evolving and interacting

22
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,640
ecosystems and the purpose of the

23
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,399
document is to enable the ICANN

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,309
community to understand the IOT

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,700
ecosystem and the interaction with the

26
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:11,100
dns and it's kind of a different type of

27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,600
report than what were you usually but

28
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,490
then what we usually put out from the

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,070
from the SF because it doesn't contain

30
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,560
any recommendations it's basically a

31
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,658
tutorial style document to help the

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,220
ICANN community understand while the

33
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,220
interaction between the IOC and the

34
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,789
domain name system what are some of the

35
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,610
opportunities that the dns offers for

36
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,470
the Internet of Things there's various

37
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,549
opportunities and then we list a few in

38
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,079
the end of report

39
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:42,799
but basically they stemmed from the from

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,000
the DNS being a globally distributed

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,159
infrastructure that can provide various

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,159
security functions on the one hand and

43
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,100
that the IOT introduces new types of

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,210
strain more stringent security stability

45
00:01:53,100 --> 00:02:00,210
and transparency requirements so for

46
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,729
example if you look at a typical IOT

47
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,619
deployment it consists of IOT devices

48
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:06,298
that interact with people's physical

49
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,419
world so they sense information but they

50
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,400
also act upon it and they have

51
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,420
connections to edge networks for

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,360
instance through

53
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,640
or Wi-Fi or 5g or whatever then connect

54
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,550
to the Internet and then connect to

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,890
back-end services that they use to to

56
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:26,480
perform their tasks so it's basically a

57
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:29,510
constellation it's like a group of AI

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,760
devices network connectivity and

59
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:36,420
services that these ISU devices make use

60
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,090
of and the opportunity for the the DNS

61
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,730
is for instance that it provides it has

62
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,519
a DNS SEC for message integrity

63
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,369
verification so with the in a sec so

64
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,980
assume that all these these IOT devices

65
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:52,319
support DNS SEC validation so they can

66
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,609
validate unisex signatures then this

67
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,768
means that they can validate that

68
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,690
they're talking to the right service on

69
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,910
the internet to perform their task for

70
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,500
instance they know that if they share

71
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,829
information about people's physical

72
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,900
environment with that back-end service

73
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,860
for analysis for instance they know that

74
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,959
they're sharing it with the right

75
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:15,540
service so this reduces the opportunity

76
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:17,880
the the probability that a cyber

77
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,880
criminal for example is able to replace

78
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,910
the genuine service with a malicious

79
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,670
service and as a result the IOT device

80
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,140
sharing since sensor data with a

81
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,030
malicious service or accepting

82
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,730
instructions from a malicious service

83
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,519
mm-hmm and what are some of the risks

84
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:39,119
that the Internet of Things poses to the

85
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,620
DNS ma the wider Internet yeah so one of

86
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,650
the risks that we identified in the

87
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:47,340
report our I OC botnets that can launch

88
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,859
DDoS attacks on DNS infrastructure these

89
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,000
and this LSA analysis based on various

90
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:53,489
measurement studies that have been

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,549
carried out by academic institution in

92
00:03:53,489 --> 00:04:01,560
the past and basically IOT botnets are

93
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:03,359
IOT devices like you know cameras and

94
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,819
lightbulbs and whatever that have been

95
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:07,140
infected by malware so they contained a

96
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:11,720
vulnerability for example and that

97
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:15,059
allowed cyber criminals for instance to

98
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,608
install malware on the device and they

99
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,988
could then control it and this means

100
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:23,849
that the botnet master in this case can

101
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:26,099
send out a command to these infected

102
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:29,340
devices to all start sending traffic

103
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,410
to a target at the same time so this

104
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,310
would then constitute a DDoS attack on

105
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,750
that target and that target could be a

106
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,090
DNS operator but could also be other

107
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,550
types of DNS infrastructure or service

108
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,789
providers like you know banks or you

109
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:47,420
know critical infrastructure like energy

110
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,420
grids for ignition

111
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:55,950
yeah so given some of the risks and

112
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:58,500
opportunities that we've identified what

113
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:00,990
are some of the challenges to the

114
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:06,000
Internet community it can address these

115
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:08,400
with yeah so one challenge - one

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,310
challenge for example is to develop a

117
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,669
unisex security library for IOT devices

118
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,740
so that T devices would be able to

119
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,660
validate the innocence signatures so

120
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,960
that's the opportunity we spoke about

121
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:27,870
before and the other challenge would be

122
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:30,479
to to mitigate DDoS attacks from IOT

123
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,560
botnets which we think requires a whole

124
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,090
range of measures so it would require

125
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,740
IOT developers for example to have a

126
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,960
better understanding of network security

127
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,930
and device security so that's more like

128
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,989
an educational component I would say

129
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:48,030
there's a need for security systems in

130
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,330
edge network so that they can detect and

131
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:54,299
clip off DDoS attacks or DDoS traffic

132
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:57,289
from ihe devices early on so proactively

133
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:00,240
I would say and there is need for

134
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:03,150
forward infrastructure operators to for

135
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,770
instance share information on IOT

136
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,260
botanist so for instance they could

137
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,849
share information on what type of DDoS

138
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,980
of traffic a certain botnet will

139
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,270
generate how they handled it and then

140
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,070
share that information with other

141
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,979
infrastructure operators like a DNS

142
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:18,930
operator so that they are prepared in

143
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:22,260
case the attack traffic comes their way

144
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:24,410
yeah yeah okay Thank You Christian

145
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,050
