00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,900
hey miss Mary Wong I am a vice president

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,390
for strategic community operations

8
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,400
planning an engagement at ICANN org

9
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,970
and because this is ICANN there's always

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,849
an acronym so my team is called the

11
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,310
scope team we are situated within the

12
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:31,220
policy development support department of

13
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,829
ICANN what we do is a little bit

14
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,960
different from some of the other teams

15
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:38,089
within the policy department that you

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,120
may be more familiar with the other

17
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:43,730
teams are organized in accordance with

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,640
their support of specific structures

19
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:49,218
within the community so for example for

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,039
the other teams we have a team for the

21
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:53,629
generic name supporting organization we

22
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,850
have a team that supports the

23
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:59,299
governmental Advisory Committee and so

24
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,739
forth that is not the scope team the

25
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:03,250
scope team is essentially a

26
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:07,039
cross-functional cross-departmental team

27
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:10,430
and we have the advantage of taking a

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,680
step back from each community's work and

29
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:16,250
looking at things in a more holistic

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,800
fashion so we assist the community with

31
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,930
cross-community topics and other

32
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,060
collaborative work that they need to

33
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,580
engage in across the different

34
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:29,000
supporting organizations and advisory

35
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:32,030
structures we also work with our CEO as

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,640
well as our boss the senior vice

37
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,910
president for policy development support

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,060
on cross departmental initiatives that

39
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:44,000
ranging from communications to the

40
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,820
community communications to the public

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,610
as well as the all-important public

42
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:57,050
comment proceedings which is a critical

43
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:58,970
part of participation at ICANN what

44
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,610
makes me excited about the work that I

45
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,710
do I think is the same as what makes

46
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,409
every member of the staff at ICANN

47
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,610
excited about what we do but

48
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:09,860
specifically within the scope team

49
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,470
because we have a wide-ranging

50
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,120
opportunity to support a whole number of

51
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,970
community initiatives it

52
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,519
really makes us feel that we are here in

53
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,129
service to the community to their needs

54
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:26,060
to their priorities at any one point in

55
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:29,120
time the icon community is made up of

56
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,940
volunteers volunteers who commit a great

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,400
deal of time energy and effort to

58
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,650
consensus-building and I can what the

59
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,650
scope team does is we support those

60
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,480
efforts so if we are running high

61
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,459
interest topic sessions at ICANN

62
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,738
meetings that bring together different

63
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:48,769
elements of the community that might

64
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:51,500
ordinarily not work together we think

65
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,870
that makes a difference for example if

66
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,299
were running public comment proceedings

67
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,670
which are critical to getting

68
00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:01,579
participation at ICANN for important

69
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,768
policy proposals that gives the

70
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:06,560
community and the public at large a

71
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:09,349
voice in policies that affect the domain

72
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,879
name system so we think we make a big

73
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:13,459
difference in bringing the community

74
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,640
together at ICANN and bringing ICANN to

75
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,280
the rest of the world

76
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,339
