[Music]

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,219
hi I'm Rachel Macfadyen and I'm at I can

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:16,619
65 in Marrakech Morocco with Rafiq democ

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:20,160
the G NSO vice chair and head of the PDP

5
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:23,279
3.0 team and we're here to talk about

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:28,380
that and about the evolving the

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:31,710
multi-stakeholder model welcome so let's

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:36,420
talk first about the PDP 3.0 model or

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:38,460
the PDP 3.0 effort so how is that going

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,500
so far what what is your impression of

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,250
how it's good okay so I think we are

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:48,180
making progress so we started in Kobe

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,820
meeting by forming the team composed by

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:55,980
volunteers from the genus or Council and

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:59,090
we set up our work plan and we set a

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,230
target to deliver our work in terms of

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,650
implementation to the genus or council

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,950
by the meeting in Moorea so that now

19
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,710
give us a roughly four month to finish

20
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:14,340
our work and give us a little background

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,970
about what the state of the project is

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,979
and how you know where you're at with

23
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,020
what it looks like at this point okay so

24
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:26,100
yeah background it's important to

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:29,939
understand where we started in the

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:36,810
beginning so it was in last year we had

27
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:39,869
our TNS on council meeting in LA January

28
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,729
last year and so we had that kind of

29
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,189
really frank and candid discussion

30
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:49,049
between councilor about all the issues

31
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:50,729
and the concerns they see in term of the

32
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,960
policy development process and working

33
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:58,679
groups and we get as an input staff

34
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,320
paper kind of highlighting some issues

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,299
from their perspective and using that we

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,329
had that discussion and dialogue and

37
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,940
thought how how we can do better what

38
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,220
kind of improvement we need to do and I

39
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,740
think

40
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,230
the really key words on this is how we

41
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,780
make the PDP more effective and

42
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,239
efficient and understanding all the

43
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:24,140
constraints we have in terms of the

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:26,750
budget human resource and to do better

45
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,179
planning so we finish on time and so on

46
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:33,500
so we had that discussion and we spent

47
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,750
like last year working on the

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,980
recommendation and they will approve it

49
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:42,190
in Barcelona meeting but after them the

50
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:46,209
recommendation what matters is the

51
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:49,550
implementation and the discussion and

52
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:52,640
the general council level was is what's

53
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,440
the best approach to do so and it's

54
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,109
important I think for the council to

55
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:01,840
take ownership and something get started

56
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:04,870
and we have the small TF composite of

57
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,700
councilor representing the different

58
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:11,320
stakeholder group in the enso

59
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:14,359
and I said we started in Kobe and we are

60
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,420
making progress in our work to get

61
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,610
things delivered by Mori heart because

62
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,738
we are talking about to be effective and

63
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:25,610
efficient and we have to live up to

64
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:28,220
those expectations ourselves so this is

65
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:31,760
a really ambitious project this is

66
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:37,010
talking about looking at root and branch

67
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:39,109
of the way that I can makes policy so

68
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,170
this gets at the multi-stakeholder model

69
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:44,660
of governance so this gets into you

70
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:47,359
evolving the multi-stakeholder model of

71
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:51,109
governance how do these two efforts work

72
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,900
together so our kind of initiative or

73
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,910
project pre proceed or predates this

74
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,180
whole discussion about the mentee

75
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,670
stakeholder model evilish evolution and

76
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,670
also in terms of focus we are really

77
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,619
just about the PDT because we need to

78
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:09,350
remind that the General Council is the

79
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,140
policy manager and so it was important

80
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:14,989
for us to see what we can do better as a

81
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:18,320
manager of the process but also what we

82
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:21,168
need to do to help the working group so

83
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,990
the idea how we can support the working

84
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:25,690
group leadership

85
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,790
what the role of the liaison from the

86
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,729
council and then how they can help in

87
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,860
the working group and also what we need

88
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:35,770
to provide in term of resourcing and how

89
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,600
we can do a better planning but also if

90
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,729
you see it as a term of project

91
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,509
management we improve the reporting and

92
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:45,219
so on so it was the focus well for the

93
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:49,150
genesis was really about the genesis of

94
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:53,199
PDP and I see that it's important to

95
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:56,080
have this PDP 3 that all to succeed as

96
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,710
it's kind of a continuous improvement we

97
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,510
see and I understand that many parties

98
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:05,440
within Jeana so they want to participate

99
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:08,530
and give their their input so it's kind

100
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,300
of I think it will set for the future

101
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:15,400
and we will continue and probably maybe

102
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:19,660
we need to to see how we can include

103
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:23,789
more input and so on compared to what's

104
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:30,010
going on with this multi stakeholder

105
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:34,090
evolving model I get there is overlap

106
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:36,280
and this is maybe what can concern many

107
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,679
parties it's just we we should avoid the

108
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,590
overlap or different duplication of

109
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,539
efforts and this is this is what we are

110
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,900
doing is more bottom-up we need really

111
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:49,060
we need it really to to succeed and at

112
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,270
the end we probably we need to continue

113
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,310
the improvement because there is no way

114
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,530
we'll fix all of all the problem we are

115
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,169
trying to adjust and we are learning

116
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:02,260
from the experience and of what we will

117
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:07,150
apply in the future and hopefully things

118
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:09,520
will change so give us a an idea of what

119
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:13,659
you're focusing on in the next say three

120
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:16,930
to six months in fact even less than

121
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:19,719
that four months I mean we have several

122
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,729
category of recommendation that we are

123
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,060
working on the implementation but this

124
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:26,830
is basically really like how we can get

125
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,470
the consensus because all our

126
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,510
recommendations are consensus basis so

127
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,460
saying we need day they are consensus

128
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,050
made it's not in our office we need more

129
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,180
guidelines we need to support

130
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,550
working group leadership and kind of how

131
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,460
to get that and also in terms of

132
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:47,720
procedure do we need to improve them do

133
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:50,650
we need to add more I'll say guidance so

134
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,720
it will help all parties to understand

135
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:56,750
the procedure on the other hand is for

136
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,030
example to improve their reporting it's

137
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:02,810
not just to add more workload to the

138
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:05,599
team but it's to help the General

139
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,780
Counsel's policy manager to monitor

140
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:12,139
what's going on and so also to add that

141
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:15,229
that accountability so we said we have

142
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:19,729
those categories and we know that they

143
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:21,699
are not enough in fact they're from what

144
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:23,628
we discussed last year we have some

145
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,729
recommendation that they were not

146
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:29,180
approved yet and we know that they need

147
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:32,810
more discussion and also during the work

148
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:35,090
of the PDP 3 that all team we kind of

149
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,979
find out there are many maybe some area

150
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:39,770
for improvement but since we're just

151
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:41,539
focusing on the implementation we are

152
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,270
thinking just we can propose that the

153
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:48,080
General Council for further work in the

154
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:50,719
future so yeah we have forma we need to

155
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,000
get things done as said before because

156
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:56,360
we have to live up of what we are asking

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,669
the work working groups and gns so to do

158
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,500
and it's also a good experience for us

159
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:05,779
to see if what is visible and not and

160
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,300
I'd say using some of those

161
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:11,210
recommendations in practice and see if

162
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:15,500
we need some so much has been what is

163
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:19,128
your best case scenario in the in the

164
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:22,610
you know in the mediate future in the

165
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:24,529
you know I uh I won't be optimistic

166
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,539
enough to say at the you know at the end

167
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:28,250
game but like in the immediate future

168
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:31,279
what's your best case scenario I think

169
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:34,039
it's kind of to some extent is going

170
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,078
it's happening is really to succeed in

171
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,390
implementing this recommendation as soon

172
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:40,958
as possible I mean it's fine to spend

173
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:45,020
the time to think about recommendation

174
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:47,099
or to work out implementation but what

175
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:50,250
Matt is really that it's implementing

176
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:53,460
and to practice it and so to see that in

177
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:57,120
in a real cases so yeah the best cases

178
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:59,100
we get those implemented or I mean based

179
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,740
in the plan we are working on as soon as

180
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,530
possible hopefully like by next year in

181
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:08,010
a new working group or even in existing

182
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:11,610
working group trying to kind of improve

183
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:15,270
them and to help them there in their

184
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:18,090
work so that's really what I hope and

185
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:20,250
what we want to achieve great I wanted

186
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,380
to go back to one of the the issues that

187
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,910
you meant mentioned before about the

188
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:28,950
some of the issues that the community

189
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:33,300
raised about a lovely issues list and

190
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:36,630
you know the some of the issues with the

191
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,750
policy development process how do you

192
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:44,370
feel you know the progress has been made

193
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:45,810
in addressing some of those so I cannot

194
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,620
really speak about the issues this but

195
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,849
because that's in an ongoing process but

196
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:54,030
reading some of the comment I think

197
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:57,270
there is some overlap of what we are

198
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,860
trying to do or achieve but I understand

199
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,530
there is a lot of work still to be done

200
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,570
and I really believe that process as

201
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:08,220
what we have that can be tweaked and

202
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:09,900
adjusted can respond to this so we need

203
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,480
to know there is a frustration and the

204
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,300
different part is part of the community

205
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,650
about the PDP in terms of effectiveness

206
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:22,170
efficiency being done in timely manner

207
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:25,260
and so on but also we need to balance

208
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:28,110
that about all kind of the principle we

209
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:31,050
have like diversity representation and

210
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,820
so on and that's also at work in our

211
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,900
thinking when we start discussing the

212
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:40,920
PDP 3.0 so it's how you can improve and

213
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:42,360
keeping those principles and so like

214
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,000
that's what we are now doing to the

215
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,890
implementation is to think do we need

216
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,290
some guidelines do we need some

217
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:53,840
checklist for decision-making and so and

218
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:56,040
to improve that process I know that

219
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,040
usually and I can we are quite a

220
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,810
procedural process oriented but at the

221
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,319
end it's kind of

222
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:07,199
a needed factor to ensure the trusted in

223
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,720
all parts with different interesting I

224
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,550
can they can work together so that's why

225
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,220
we're spending time in the process it's

226
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:16,949
not because it's it's our hobby but it's

227
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,380
one of way that you can get everyone to

228
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:22,260
work together that's excellent

229
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:26,460
thank you very much thank you thank you
