[Applause]

48
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:07,360
so this award was launched in 2014 in

49
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:09,810
London and it's for recipients of the

50
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,270
icon community who exhibits two things

51
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,490
one is outstanding contribution to icon

52
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,400
and the other one is outstanding

53
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,860
character and what do we mean by

54
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,750
outstanding contribution to icon in

55
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,420
particular the multi-stakeholder model

56
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,650
this is why it's called

57
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,350
multi-stakeholder ethos there are two

58
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:33,010
parts the award so the multi-stakeholder

59
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:35,440
part is people in our community who

60
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,890
exhibits two characteristics with a

61
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,130
vides model one is your a

62
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,130
consensus-builder

63
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,109
that's the number one thing and the

64
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,690
panel when it decides to make sure that

65
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:49,300
the winner is a consensus-builder the

66
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,640
second thing is that you have given

67
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,610
significant commitment of your time for

68
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,850
your effort of your dedication to the

69
00:03:54,610 --> 00:04:00,400
higher interest of icon so everything

70
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,510
you do is in the interest of icon so

71
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,360
that's why there is the

72
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:08,070
multi-stakeholder part of the title now

73
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:11,730
ethos is a very interesting thing

74
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:15,820
ethos I'm gonna ask you three questions

75
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:17,798
and it's a really puzzle here if you're

76
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,769
able to answer you'll understand where

77
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:23,530
the ethos first of all what is the

78
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:30,550
language the original language of ethos

79
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:33,280
oh all right you know it it's gonna give

80
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,950
you three choices Arabic French or Greek

81
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,359
some people said Greek it is correct

82
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:42,849
okay how old is the word ethos I'm going

83
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,610
to give you three options how old is it

84
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,150
a thousand six hundred and fifty years

85
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,080
old

86
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:53,659
is it a thousand nine hundred or is it

87
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,770
two thousand four hundred years old

88
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:01,460
oh so you know how I play the game yes

89
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:04,460
so it is Greek and it's 2400 years old

90
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:09,049
the next question and the last one who

91
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:12,620
coined the word ethos was it Sokratis

92
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:16,820
was it Alexander the Great or was it

93
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,150
Aristotle you got it so it's a Greek

94
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,140
word

95
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:24,530
it's 2400 years old and it's Aristotle

96
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,180
who coined the phrase ethos so it's been

97
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,340
there two thousand four hundred years

98
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:31,430
and we've only used it for five years of

99
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,739
our existence so who is Aristotle

100
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,510
anybody knows I'll help you he's a

101
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,620
philosopher he's a Greek philosopher

102
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:41,360
obviously he's a scientist he's a writer

103
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:44,570
and he's a thinker about psychology and

104
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,090
ethics and he came up with the word

105
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,960
ethos in one of his works and the work

106
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:54,909
was rhetoric and in that work he defined

107
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:58,010
ethos as three things good morals

108
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:02,090
someone was good morals someone was good

109
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:03,219
sense and someone with good will so now

110
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,469
you know why it's called

111
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,910
multi-stakeholder ethos award

112
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,100
multi-stakeholders cause what you do in

113
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,440
ICANN and ethos because you have those

114
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,830
three characteristics of good morals

115
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:18,820
good sense and good will so who was the

116
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:22,099
first recipient of this award

117
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:24,290
Avra Doria and I'm very proud to say she

118
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,660
is a member of the board these days

119
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:31,070
because apparently the board never wins

120
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:34,210
that award only the community and who is

121
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:37,280
the last person to receive this award

122
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,830
exactly god bless his soul Stefan Van

123
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,940
Gelder next last year when we awarded

124
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:46,219
him this award and deservedly so so it

125
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:49,340
is a great honor for anyone to receive

126
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,650
this award because it's you the peers

127
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,390
the friends the colleagues that decides

128
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,489
on that person it's your belief that

129
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,500
that person he or she deserved the award

130
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,300
for those two things the

131
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,050
multi-stakeholder contribution and the

132
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:05,210
character and frankly we have a panel

133
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,910
of community leaders that make that

134
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:10,370
decision I don't envy them because they

135
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,650
get a list of very very good people how

136
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,360
they make that choice I don't know but

137
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,940
I'm desperate to know what it is and

138
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,530
with that I'm gonna stop here and wait

139
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,729
for the results and hand the world to

140
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,729
America thank you very much

141
