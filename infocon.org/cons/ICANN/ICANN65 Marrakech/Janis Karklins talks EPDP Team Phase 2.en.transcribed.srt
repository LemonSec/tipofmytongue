00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,960
I'm James Cole and I'm here at I can 65

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,090
in Marrakech Morocco with Hannah's car

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,740
klain's chair of the expedited policy

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,870
development process on the temporary

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,380
specification for gTLD registration data

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,570
or a PDP phase to be honest what has the

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,830
e PDB team been focusing on during its

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:28,830
phase to work so in reality we're

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:34,670
working to develop a standard which

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:41,239
would allow requesters to access and

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:43,620
data possessors disclose private data

13
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:47,660
which would be in full compliance with

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,660
the gdpr requirements and also we're

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:54,419
addressing issues that have not been

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:56,940
finalized during the first phase and so

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,010
all that would constitute the scope of

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,800
our activities what are you even working

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,300
on during ICANN 65 in your sessions look

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,939
we're at the beginning of the process

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,908
and and of course as it happens at the

22
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,729
beginning you always try to project and

23
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,970
develop architecture of the process and

24
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,900
this is what we did in first months of

25
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:21,570
our activities now we are starting to

26
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:24,330
address substantive issues and we're

27
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:29,869
starting to work on building blocks for

28
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:33,630
that standardized system so it is very

29
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:38,070
difficult to say how we will get to the

30
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:40,829
end because it is a little bit of we're

31
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:44,039
learning by doing we tried several

32
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,889
approaches during the online meetings

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,250
that that we have every week and seems

34
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,700
to me that finally we have come to the

35
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:57,860
right approach which seems comfortable

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:01,680
to all team members we're using a case

37
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:05,579
specific case in order to do a deep dive

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,750
on all the elements or all the aspects

39
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:13,060
of practice that could be put in place

40
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,459
in order to be GDP are compliant from

41
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:19,209
side and from other side we hope that

42
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:22,870
this deep dive dye will provide us with

43
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:26,500
information on potential trends that

44
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:29,349
would then be transcribed as a policy

45
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:34,290
proposal the other important topics you

46
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:39,160
want to highlight okay I think this is

47
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:42,970
multi-dimensional issue that entails

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:45,340
different aspects of the process and we

49
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,840
need to find consensus on all those

50
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,650
those dimensions basically we're working

51
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:54,160
on developing probably multi-dimensional

52
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:56,620
matrix which then need to be adaptable

53
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,620
to every situation that may come in in

54
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,810
the future because today we're using GD

55
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,890
P R as a basis of our conversation and

56
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:08,349
we do not know when and in which country

57
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,569
another privacy law may be adopted and

58
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:14,290
then I can would need to be compliant

59
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:17,380
with that so therefore we're trying to

60
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:22,209
work out a standard which would be then

61
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:24,549
adaptable to every real situation also

62
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,320
in the future so what what are these

63
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:30,190
these aspects are first first of all

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,950
identify who would be requesters of

65
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,079
information what would be legal basis of

66
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,358
that that requests what would be legal

67
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,700
bases on disclosure of information what

68
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:42,010
save guard should be put in place making

69
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,880
sure that that the liability does not

70
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:48,940
kick in and and and and of course we

71
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:51,010
need to look the issues from different

72
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:55,239
perspectives because from one side you

73
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:58,780
have people who argue that protection of

74
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:01,540
privacy and private data should prevail

75
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,739
over every other consideration from

76
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,480
other side you have people arguing that

77
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:11,470
Whois data is extremely important and

78
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:14,920
useful for securing stability and

79
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:18,910
security of of Internet and we need to

80
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:22,419
reconcile those two maybe contradicting

81
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,250
or competing opinions and come up with a

82
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:25,010
workable solution because again we can

83
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,080
work on

84
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,599
reticle solution and if that is not

85
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,370
workable basically its waste waste of

86
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,260
time and opportunity

87
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,280
what is the ocular organization of

88
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:39,830
relationship to the unified access model

89
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:43,280
this is a one of options that might be

90
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:45,680
as an outcome of the process but not the

91
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,289
only one so therefore we for the moment

92
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,690
we're not looking specifically to

93
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:53,570
unified access model which has been

94
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:56,630
proposed as one of the options where

95
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:59,050
we're going slightly broader we're

96
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,130
talking about a standardized system

97
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,130
which would consist of different

98
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:07,460
building blocks and then we would see

99
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:13,190
how those building blocks would fit

100
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:15,349
together whether that would be standard

101
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,930
which would be compulsory for everyone

102
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:21,040
or that would be a standard which would

103
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:29,110
be proposed for use on voluntary basis

104
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:33,080
whether that would be used by gTLD

105
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:37,130
registrar's and registries or CCS also

106
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,770
would would use it if need be all those

107
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:43,310
questions will be answered sometime at

108
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:46,400
the later stage of the of the of our

109
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:49,580
work what are the next steps after I can

110
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,370
sixty five online meetings but of course

111
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:55,729
now in more serious though of course we

112
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:58,460
need we need to try to progress as

113
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:01,400
quickly as as we can because there is a

114
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,530
high expectations in the community that

115
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,530
some substantive progress will be

116
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:09,349
demonstrated by November meeting again I

117
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:13,849
do not know whether we will succeed with

118
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:16,250
any initial report remains to be seen

119
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,860
but certainly my aim is to make sure

120
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,710
that we demonstrate substantive progress

121
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:24,170
that we could also present during during

122
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,120
the November meeting to the community

123
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,590
well thank you for joining me today

124
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,890
Janice and I really hope the rest

125
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:34,159
meeting is fruitful and productive thank

126
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:40,919
you very much see you in November

127
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,920
