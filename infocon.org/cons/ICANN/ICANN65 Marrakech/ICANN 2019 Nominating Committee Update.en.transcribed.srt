Jake you tell us what your experience is

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,539
Chair Elect yeah you know it's it's been

22
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,070
a whirlwind it was a little bit of an

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,539
unusual experience and that I didn't get

24
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:00,480
involved as chair-elect with this NomCom

25
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,609
until April after the coab a meeting so

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,140
I got a call from Damon and it was a

27
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,650
couple days before the intersessional

28
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,500
meeting in LA and he asked me to rejoin

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,880
NomCom and thankfully I actually had

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,970
some flexibility might schedule that

31
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,220
weekend and we went to LA and we we did

32
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,770
our intersessional process and now here

33
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,200
I have in Marrakesh so it's but it's

34
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,240
been a very busy period for me to rejoin

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,970
Dom come but it's also been really

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,990
rewarding to see how the entire

37
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,000
committee has been able to work together

38
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,250
very successful this year if you're

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,540
selected is the 2020 NomCom chair what

40
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,710
do you want to focus on the next year

41
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,970
yeah I mean there's a lot to focus on

42
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:41,610
Damon and Enza he'd have done an

43
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,500
excellent job of I think making our our

44
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,799
procedures a lot more robust and a lot

45
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,020
more effective so it's my intention to

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,520
look at how we can optimize the timing

47
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,020
of the NomCom processes for members of

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,670
the committee it's it's actually little

49
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,229
bit frustrating and that there's not a

50
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,790
lot of work to do right now at the

51
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,700
beginning of the year and then there's a

52
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,520
huge amount of work to do because this

53
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,060
year we got 127 unique applicants

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,170
applying for 190 positions and so in a

55
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,630
very short period of time right now

56
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:16,690
all the noncom members had to go through

57
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,880
all those applications ranking sorting

58
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,000
we had the intersessional so there's

59
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,220
huge burst of work so I think we can

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,900
make some changes that will level up the

61
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,830
amount of work that we have to do to

62
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,380
make it a little bit more manageable

63
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,360
throughout the year daemon what are you

64
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,840
most proud of accomplishing this year on

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,720
the NomCom

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,210
well one of the issues that we face this

67
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,150
year with the NomCom is that under the

68
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:42,370
ICANN bylaws we had to have at least one

69
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,400
of our appointees come from the African

70
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,800
region and that was going to be a

71
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,740
critical challenge for us and so with

72
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,740
the support of I can't org we retained a

73
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,510
recruitment firm and we also engaged in

74
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,030
several new outreach and recruitment

75
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,769
efforts within the NomCom and I'm very

76
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,870
pleased to report that those were that

77
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,090
those efforts were very fruitful we have

78
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,550
a large pool of candidates from Africa

79
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,680
and we were really able to address that

80
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,600
challenge head-on with the support of

81
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,660
our recruitment committee our outreach

82
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,400
committees and also with with ICANN org

83
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,690
support as well gentlemen it's been a

84
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,190
pleasure speaking with both of you and

85
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,239

86
