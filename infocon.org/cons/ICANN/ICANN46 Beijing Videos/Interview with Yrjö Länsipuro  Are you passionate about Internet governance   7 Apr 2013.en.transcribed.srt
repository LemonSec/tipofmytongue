43
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">qualities you would normally set for</font>

44
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,660
people of that category in any

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,230
organization i would say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

48
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:36,399
that's something that that should be

49
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:39,070
really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> motivation of these people so</font>

50
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,710
is it hard to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a passion ah no I</font>

00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:44,530
mean your day how many here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Beijing</font>

53
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,810
passionate people because it's because

54
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:55,240
they have come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this meeting but but</font>

55
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:59,050
still when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask people to work gonna</font>

56
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:03,130
like 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours a week to come to three</font>

57
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:05,800
major meetings a year plus a couple of

58
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:09,820
workshop and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth and then</font>

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:13,900
the compensation is not so much so so

60
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:16,690
you have to rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on their passion for</font>

61
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:20,470
the internet for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the for the freedom of</font>

62
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:23,859
the internet for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the for the for the for</font>

63
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:26,709
keeping what we what we have and and

64
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,330
keeping it free and functioning for all

65
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:29,709
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world so the</font>

66
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,600
motivation has to be something other

67
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,640
than compensation motivation is

68
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,430
something else and compensation this is

69
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,579
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not looking for people who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

70
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:43,480
take this as a as a job<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it's it's</font>

71
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:46,660
not it doesn't bring that money but and

72
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:51,700
and that and in addition of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

73
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:55,030
people who have time from their day job

74
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:57,670
or whatever to devote<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this to this</font>

75
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,160
effort when you think of I can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

76
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom-up multi-stakeholder model how</font>

77
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,709
important is<font color="#E5E5E5"> non calm well to my mind</font>

78
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,260
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really the key element there</font>

79
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:12,100
because the noncom is composed of

80
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:15,160
representatives of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> constituents of</font>

81
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,469
all communities I mean we have the only

82
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:22,019
supporting organizations represented a

83
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:25,990
lack and and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth and so</font>

84
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:30,520
since i can has no share<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

85
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:34,750
who usually make these selections has<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

86
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:40,359
members as such so the noncom is really

87
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:46,000
the element<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is substituting for for</font>

88
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:49,240
those those elements and and and twice

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,150
the tries to in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact it is say it is a</font>

90
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,250
democratic element in an icon structure

91
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,810
now if I'm watching this video and I'm
