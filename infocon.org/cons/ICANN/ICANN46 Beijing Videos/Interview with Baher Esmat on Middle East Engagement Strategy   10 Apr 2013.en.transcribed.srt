started like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3-4 months ago in Toronto</font>

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,750
when we met with you know community

members talking about the Africa

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,990
strategy and they liked the idea they

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,750
thought they would need one for the

12
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,729
Middle East work started back then and

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,390
and you know so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are what's the</font>

16
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,250
in essence sort of capsulize that

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,110
strategy<font color="#CCCCCC"> forming just give me a basic</font>

18
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,870
overview on the main main strategic

19
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:47,399
goals are around fostering engagement

20
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,280
two-way engagement between I can and the

21
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,210
community that's that's one

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,640
strengthening the domain name industry

the region through regional and national

26
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:03,480
processes and mechanisms how does what's

27
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,979
the point behind regional strategies why

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,320
not just have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great big umbrella</font>

29
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,630
strategy why do at region by region what

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,449
we're still guided by the overall I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

31
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,929
strategic plan right but we're trying to

identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> the needs and priorities for</font>

33
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,979

overall plan

40
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,329
once you've got that strategy is
