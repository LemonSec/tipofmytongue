vibrant place it's a vibrant place and

directly from the ministers are very

24
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:37,049
vibrant there is tremendous movement

25
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:40,259
forward in China and I felt this when I

came here a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few weeks ago and all of you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">great place and of course we all</font>

30
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,130
mentioned the numbers 564 million

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet users just in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font>

they've added over 40 million new

internet users the numbers are

34
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,579
staggering but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want us to not only</font>

35
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,270
focus on the numbers I think we should

36
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:12,390
focus on where they're going

37
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:16,110
because China is going to be a central

38
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:19,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of where the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet community as</font>

39
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:23,600
we know it is heading and therefore in

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:28,140
my clear discussions with the local

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:32,519
responsible ministers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> from I can't</font>

43
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:40,319
an option it is not an option if we do

44
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:44,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">not engage with China at every level of</font>

45
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:47,339
our community we frankly lose a part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

46
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:50,609
our global legitimacy we must and we

47
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:54,209
will and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we're here today</font>

48
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:57,180
with the great numbers that we have

49
00:02:54,209 --> 00:03:00,390
shared<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you more than 2,500 people</font>

this is the largest meeting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> i Kenned</font>

51

history it's happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now so I'm</font>

52
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:12,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">delighted by that I will speak</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to many</font>

53

of you at length in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next hour here</font>

54
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,510
so I will conclude<font color="#E5E5E5"> on one important note</font>

55
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:24,630
there are many organizations on this

56
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,150
planet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do different things but</font>

57
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,910
having been now part of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> great i kin</font>

58
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:33,870
community for six months<font color="#CCCCCC"> i must tell you</font>

59
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:37,049
something we have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

60
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:40,049
unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would like to call it our</font>

61
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:42,299
magical ingredient it's what makes us

62
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:45,239
special what<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes us unique and</font>

63
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:48,420
different and that's the fact that no

64
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:52,109
matter what we keep each other to this

65
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:55,170
bottom-up multi-stakeholder model that

66
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:58,620
is what makes us who we are and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font>

67
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:01,380
very clear having learned this myself

68
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,980
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last few months that if we lose</font>

69
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,680
this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose everything everyone can</font>

70
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,888
hold big meetings everyone can set up

71
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,280
great technical standards but very few

72
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:16,859
can claim to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom</font>

73
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:20,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">always in a multi-stakeholder fashion</font>

74
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,930
that is our magical Ingrid

75
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:31,790
so in front of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you I personally</font>

76
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:35,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">renew my commitment to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and I asked</font>

77
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:38,810
all of us to keep watch on each other as

78
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:41,780
you have done with me<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we keep that</font>

79
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,660
important ingredient the center of who

80
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:48,729
we are welcome to China and I hope you

81
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a great meeting thank you</font>
