that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the GAC was working very very hard</font>

late into the evening before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again</font>

Thursday to to prepare it and as you

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,739
said it arrived there's quite a bit of

16
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:47,149
content in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> they cover a number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

17
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:49,339
points we're we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been working closely</font>

18
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:51,980
with the GAC over a period of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,690
develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> a process to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that each</font>

21
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:59,449
community case is dealt<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a clarity</font>

22
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:00,530
so we take the each of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the items in</font>

23
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,420
there and we make sure that we

24
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,819
understand it and we iterate echo it

25
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,520
back and then we go through each<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font>

26

<font color="#E5E5E5">the items carefully and depending upon</font>

how complicated it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> or what issues it</font>

28
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,818
raises it may take longer or shorter but

29
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,399
we want quite a bit of visibility so we

30
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:19,249
have a so-called GAC register in which

31
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:20,630
each item is posted and is visible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

32
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:23,359
everybody and go through a series of

33
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:27,520
phases all of which has been worked out

34
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,520
in a constructive fashion with them

35
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:36,950
there's a GAC advice regarding treatment

36
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:38,630
of names in the that have been applied

37
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:42,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">for Strings that have been applied for</font>

38
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:45,348
and there's a certain amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of texture</font>

39
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:47,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">and substance to it some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a smaller</font>

41
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,529

broader advice about categories<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

43
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:57,529
forth there are interesting issues in in

that it's advice but it is the

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,100
governments of the world talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I</font>

64

gak communicate and more<font color="#CCCCCC"> generally</font>

66
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,179
advice from governments carries quite a

67
00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:00,830
bit of weight and equally it is not the

68
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">end of the story of that we have a</font>

carefully constructed multi-stakeholder

70
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:09,420
process we want very much to listen to

71
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:12,840
governments and we also want to make

72
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:19,230
sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a balance the way our</font>

if you will toward<font color="#CCCCCC"> following advice from</font>

75
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:27,540
the GAC but not an<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolute requirement</font>

76
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:30,810
and lays out a process that if we choose

77
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,880
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to follow the gacks advice we have</font>

78
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,250
to go through a first day an extended

79
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,530
consultation process and then at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font>

80
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,660
of the day if we finally are not in

agreement and haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

82
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:45,359
a common resolution then we'd have to

83
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:50,400
document quite carefully and be prepared

84
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,690
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next phase</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that which will be</font>

the government's expressing their

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:58,859

public comment process is actually

94
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,320
strengthening that agreement it's what

95
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:26,490
makes it an agreement of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community</font>

96
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,240
to manage how our registrar's do their

144
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,719
we will also<font color="#E5E5E5"> do our very best</font>

145
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,270
operationally to keep the program on the

<font color="#CCCCCC">amount of impact in delay on the program</font>

149
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,180
so what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing from you is</font>

150
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,960
inclusion doesn't necessarily equate to

151
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,229
delay

152
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,930
in this case it won't simply because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

153
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:49,139
have some agility and flexibility on the

<font color="#E5E5E5">operational side for example the next</font>

certainly their registry registrar's now

161
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,940
we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially do something about</font>

162
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:14,340
advancing this step ahead of contracting

163
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,440
finding a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start pre delegation</font>

164
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,969
testing before the final contract is

165
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,960
done we're looking at all these

166
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:24,570
possibilities now my commitment is to

167
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:28,710
clarity and visibility of the timeline

168
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:32,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the program many resources and a lot</font>

we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> committed to that and we'll make</font>

179
00:07:51,659 --> 00:08:01,080
be clear we cannot tie the policies of a

181

that the Chinese economy is a very

forward in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> period i also leave</font>

changes some of these may be systemic

00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:13,150
but the community must get engaged in

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,400
that and therefore i launched on my
