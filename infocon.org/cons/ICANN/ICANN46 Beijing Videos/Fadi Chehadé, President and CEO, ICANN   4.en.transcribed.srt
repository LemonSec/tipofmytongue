00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,660
we went from Africa to the Middle East

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,300
and to Latin America and as you can see

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:16,230
we have started<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same thing bottom up</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a country I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

telling people here's an example here's

73
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,850
an example of how a country at the

74
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,310
country level embraced the

75
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,350
multi-stakeholder model and I'm I can't

76

79
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,760
change their laws since I visited them

80
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,140
to allow governments to sit on a

81
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,179
non-profit board and run the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet in</font>

their country they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to CGI</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dog they</font>

they're moving forward with it and we'll

85
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:45,420
be announcing these in the weeks ahead

86
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,670
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> engagement we're leaning into</font>

87
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">the communities that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to hear from i</font>

at the wicket<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this was not an easy</font>

95
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,620
no we're not going to go there but we

96
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:16,228
did and with Steve's leadership and the

97
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">board's support incredible support we</font>

98
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:21,149
went and we engage and it made a

99
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,370
difference it did make a difference and

100
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,739
in fact today as we

101
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,320
speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> several of the countries at the</font>

102
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,780
wicket that met us and engaged with us

103
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,490
have now joined the GAC and they're part

104
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:40,830
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our government advisory committee and</font>

105
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:43,050
that's what engagement does we're also

106
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,359
engaged with many of the I star

107
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,030
organizations we<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have been and</font>

108
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,889
that engagement is central I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

109
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,809
clear on this because I personally

110
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:54,330
didn't get the depth of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font>

111
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,669
continuing to learn how important it is

112
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,370
to understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a</font>

113
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:03,419
responsibility but we are part of an

114
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:07,020
ecosystem we're not alone i can has a

115
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:10,680
row I suck as a role the regional rirs

121
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:27,990

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:39,040
for you we are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of</font>

148
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:43,090
launching a program that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has enormous</font>

149
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,130
implications on the DNS industry and one

150
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:48,280
of the key things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we recognized is that</font>

151
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:50,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business framework the legal</font>

this industry is born moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward</font>

154
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,400
must be revised<font color="#E5E5E5"> and done in partnership</font>

155
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,539
with the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I've been</font>

156
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,090
meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the leaders of this</font>

157
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:07,360
industry and it's been fantastic I

158
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,609
thought frankly that I would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

159
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,070
drag some of these people into<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

160
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,470
some things in the public interest and I

161
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:18,610
must tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you they're the ones pushing</font>

192
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:48,569
opportunity to actually lift our

193
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:52,880
industry into a new time into a time of

194
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:56,010
deep understanding that we represent

195
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,990
something of value to the world the

196
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,990
public interest is at the heart of what

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,870
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to do business is good nothing</font>

199
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:09,480
place and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> must focus on the public</font>

200
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,120
interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is great news for I</font>

203
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:24,140
thing I want to say on our engagement is

204
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:29,130
that engagement sometimes is difficult

205
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:33,720
because it may look like we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going too</font>

206
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:36,180
far I got an invitation<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open be in</font>

207
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,180
the opening ceremony of the wtp<font color="#CCCCCC"> F which</font>

209
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:45,359
through the same discussion should we be

210
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:49,170
there my inclination is to be there and

211
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:53,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">to lean into every community willing to</font>

212
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:56,760
listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our multi-stakeholder model so</font>

213
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:59,520
I look to hear from many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I'm here</font>

217
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,019
something I<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned from my chairman and</font>

218
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:10,989
from

219
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:13,929
and leaning into these folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and being</font>

220
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:16,269
there and sharing with them why what we

221
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:19,689
do matters and why we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with</font>

222
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:21,399

247
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:41,549
back in Prague to be a fortress the

248
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:44,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">fortress model is not sustainable and</font>

249
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:47,589
the silos within this fortress are not

250
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:51,219
sustainable we have to break<font color="#E5E5E5"> them we</font>

251
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:53,709
have to change icons posture the winds

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> change are very powerful they come</font>

253

<font color="#CCCCCC">because of users and socio-economic</font>

254
00:11:55,629 --> 00:12:00,850
changes they come<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font>

255
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,160
technological changes governments now

need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> voice maybe I</font>

257
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,899
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know but the winds of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change are</font>

258
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:10,989
surrounding us the<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduction of the</font>

259
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:12,910
new gTLDs changes completely how people

260
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:16,360
acquire these names<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how they use</font>

261
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:20,829
them as the winds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> change come at us</font>

262
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:23,110
we must change and in the belly of

263
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,300
we have to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems and processes</font>

264
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:29,260
and structures to actually deal with

265
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:31,990
this growth so my vision of evolution is

266
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,680
that we move to a world where we become

267
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,810
truly an oasis of trust and confidence

268
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:40,380
people should come to I can and believe

269
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,839
that here they can get their work done

270
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:45,670
they can get their questions answered

271
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,410
when they put a comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a public</font>

272
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,860
comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> period they know what happened</font>

273
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:54,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">to it where did it go how did we respond</font>

274
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:58,930
to it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> must get our act so that we can</font>

275
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:02,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">become a true place of confidence and of</font>

276
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:05,920
trust for the world open and inviting

277
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:09,400
now as we go through this change a lot

278
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">of us get worried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what changes let</font>

279
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:16,840
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very clear crystal clear on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

280
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:19,720
from the inception of I can in 98 till

281
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:22,780
today and moving forward to 2020 when

282
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:28,060
this strategy will cover this period why

283
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:31,000
we are here is untouchable what we do

284
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:35,369
the scope of what we do is untouchable

285
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,910
this is who we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are that doesn't change</font>

286
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:41,770
how we do things needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change and so</font>

287
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,900
I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make that distinction because</font>

288
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,930
often we get worried that the scope is

289
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:50,819
expanding who we are is expanding that

290
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:54,040
is our rock and it does not change

291
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:56,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">however we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at new ways to</font>

292
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,569
do things and today you<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

293
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,750
things we're introducing to do that the

294
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:04,360
how is very important we introduced

295
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,910
yesterday the concept of agile grow that

296
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can that not everything has to be</font>

297
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,680
developed and what we call a waterfall

298
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:14,290
model we can do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in parallel we</font>

299
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,349
can move faster we can together think of

300
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:20,530
ways to develop policy faster to

301
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:23,380
implement programs faster that's agile

302
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:26,860
agile has transformed big companies it

303
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:29,560
has to inform how innovation happens I

304
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,810
am certain and I'm introducing these

305
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,910
ways into I can so that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also</font>

306
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,959
become a<font color="#CCCCCC"> drop</font>

307
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:41,430
now we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> change everything about how</font>

308
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:43,560
we do things except one thing so in the

309
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:47,300
how there is one thing that never

310
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:50,550
changes and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom-up</font>

311
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:53,250
multi-stakeholder model so we can change

312
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:55,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything but we cannot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change who we</font>

313
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:59,220
are and how we do things

314
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:02,040
multi-stakeholder bottom up that's our

315
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:05,910
magical ingredient and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives</font>

316
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:08,939
us the legitimacy of doing what we do so

317
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:15,030

this mission together and you come first

321
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:30,630
and your<font color="#E5E5E5"> decisions bottom-up are the</font>

322
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:32,640
ones that drive i can forward so in

323
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:35,790
conclusion<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go back to</font>

324

326
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:45,480
phase of enabling I can if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this</font>

327
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,330
well we can move into<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing good</font>

328
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,360
things and into producing great fruit

329
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:55,200
for I can and I am confident that if we

330
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,450
stay together focused and never lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

331
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:01,350
magical ingredient we will be building
