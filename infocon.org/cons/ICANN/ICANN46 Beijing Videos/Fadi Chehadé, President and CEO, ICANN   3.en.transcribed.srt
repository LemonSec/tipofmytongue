00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,710
this is the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> part as you all know</font>

Toronto we called it a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> season I have</font>

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,730

<font color="#E5E5E5">really our season and during this season</font>

10
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,870
that I think is about to say is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we're</font>

11
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,820
in the middle of and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,959
beginning of a season that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will last</font>

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:48,450
probably from now until we get to Buenos

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,360

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:02,399
where we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus on the</font>

foundations of I can on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the enable meant</font>

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:13,140
of I can right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we believe that I can</font>

20
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:17,070
needs enablement at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process level at</font>

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,860
the people level and certainly at the

22
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:24,539
system's level and we've been working on

23

the ground ready for the growth to come

26
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,210
after that and we have done some very

27
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">good things in the last six</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months so</font>

objectives and under them we outlined 16

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,600
goals this was at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beginning of our</font>

35
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,689
journey together we then committed to

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,798
you that we will take all of these and

37
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:08,579
translate them into a series of

38
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,580
portfolios programs and projects that

39
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,410
start taking everything we do that i can

40
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,740
and putting it in

41
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:20,460
to a system we have done that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

42
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:24,120
work has led to 56 portfolios a hundred

43
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,130
sixteen programs and nearly 500

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,720
different projects occurring<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two I</font>

45
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:35,280
can all of this was designed and

46
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:39,290
structured into a new system now if you

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,690
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> today to the site called my I can org</font>

48
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:45,989
you'll have for the first time

49
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:54,420
visibility into that system let me show

50
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:56,510
you so if you go to the site today<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

51
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,579
will see the same objectives goals

52
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:02,310
portfolios and programs you can go to

53
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,050
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look at each of them you will</font>

54
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,480
see the status of the various components

55
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:10,170
of that you'll know what's at risk

56
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,140
what's in trouble if you go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> each of</font>

57
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:16,350
these areas you'll see the owners and

58
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:19,220
this is the exact status of what's

59
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:22,350
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside of I can in real time</font>

60
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,880

it shows you the projects under that the

behind it and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the beginning</font>

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:02,280
projects you need to know what's

time you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that data and this is</font>

82
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,450
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board for all of the areas of</font>

83
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:28,900
this department this is

84
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:31,150
new and this is not just slides this is

85
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,010
actually linked to the applications

86
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,440
we've built in the last six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months and</font>

87
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,110
moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of our work into them and</font>

88
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,200
manage all of our work all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your work</font>

89
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:44,680
in a way that is structured that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

90
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:48,880
trackable so that we can all succeed

91
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,610
together I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give thanks to the</font>

92
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,770
incredible work that our team has put to

93
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:57,190
make that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen it was a collective</font>

94
00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:00,000
effort every function and I can is in

95
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,590
the my project section everything we do

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,660
including refilling the coffee and our

97
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:08,500
coffee machines everything is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in there</font>

98
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:11,920
and now we're tying the budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font>

99
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,440
tying the HR system at the systemic

100
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,270
level into this so now we don't even

101
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,310
need to ask someone what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are his goals</font>

102
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">or her goals for the next quarter it</font>

103
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,080
will be picked out of the system and

104
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:25,560
it'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the HR system and that's how</font>

105
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,539
we will work everything is now aligned

106
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,700
inside I can from a structural and

107
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,290
system standpoint now since we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

108
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,380
many people I'll take the chance to

109
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:38,410
remind<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what is my I can my icon is</font>

110
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:42,909
the two we introduced in Toronto that

111
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:45,700
allows you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go look at topics by topic</font>

112
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:49,180
and get information everything happening

113
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:51,490
across all of the I can wool is inside

114
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,260
this area you can look at calendars so

115
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,080
you can track everything going on at

116
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">ICANN in real time and you can transfer</font>

117
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,510
these calendars into your own calendar

118
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,700
so these are important advances in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

119
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:07,270
way we display and we share<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

120
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:09,550
with you and we hope many of you use it

121
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:12,250
and by the way we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> now thousands of</font>

122
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:15,670
registered users on my I can because you

123
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:19,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">could register and then get alerts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real</font>

124
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:21,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">time into your inbox</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before I leave</font>

125
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,270
this page I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to share with you that</font>

126
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:27,820
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're moving very fast at the</font>

127
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:31,210
moment this projects view is giving you

128
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:34,780
a view that is cut on a monthly basis on

129
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:38,950
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the month by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> durban it will</font>

130
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:40,780
become real time so by<font color="#E5E5E5"> durban when you</font>

131
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,690
go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that system you will be real</font>

132
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,150
time seeing what we're doing at that

133
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:50,710
moment and it will stay this way moving

134
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:53,830
forward back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides if I could so</font>

135
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:56,320
what this does<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it gives us the three</font>

136
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:59,710
things we committed to do in Toronto it

137
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,960
gives us agility because we now can see

138
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and be able to adjust them as we</font>

139
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">go it certainly gives us accountability</font>

140
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:11,799
I open every meeting at I can by looking

141
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:14,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">into this data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of our leaders</font>

142
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> executives start their meetings by</font>

143
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,969
looking at that data this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how we</font>

144
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:21,250
manage I can this is where it starts

145
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:23,320
this is how we keep things on track this

146
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,990
is what we promised you and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving</font>

147
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward with it of course visibility is</font>

148
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:31,150
critical we agreed with you that we are

149
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">all one community I have learned this</font>

150
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:37,750
over the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months I can is not</font>

151
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:41,530
the staff we are I can so you have to

152
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:44,920
see what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> see and help us improve full</font>

153
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,950
visibility to everything we do the next

154
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing we talked about if you recall is</font>

155
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:52,020
the changing of the structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

156
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,850
posture of I can from a presence and

157
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,950
functional standpoint this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the graph</font>

158
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,620
I showed you in Toronto and we talked

159
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:02,289
about looking at global responsibilities

160
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:05,170
and local responsibilities we have

161
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:07,570
refined that<font color="#E5E5E5"> model since then and it now</font>

162
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,910
looks a little bit like this what we've

163
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,159
discovered is that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our global</font>

164
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,680
functions instead of dividing them

165
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,660
locally across the world we will divide

166
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,570
them across these three hubs I mentioned

167
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,670
to you so these will be distributed our

168
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:24,159
legal department will be partly in Los

169
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,920
Angeles partly in Singapore partly in

170
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,290
Istanbul our compliance<font color="#E5E5E5"> Department will</font>

171
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">be distributed we are putting a very</font>

172
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:34,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult freeze as best we can on</font>

173
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:37,060
hiring in LA so that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

174
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:39,669
shifting our posture and our presence to

175
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:43,270
the other hubs as fast as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can so I</font>

176
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:45,850
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be clear these hubs are not what</font>

177
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:51,040
you'd call typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> engagement centers or</font>

178
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:52,830
offices these hubs are I can score every

179
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,930
department will be distributed at

180
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,240
prosti subs and as I said many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

181
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,160
leaders will also move to these hubs now

182
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,760
Sally our head<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stakeholder engagement</font>

183
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:06,780
will have the engagement functions which

184
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:10,290
span the industry the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government's and</font>

185
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:12,780
our community these engagement functions

186
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,750
will be localized so when we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

187
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,640
an engagement<font color="#E5E5E5"> center in Beijing this is</font>

188
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,610
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the functions that will be</font>

189
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:24,300
here so we can go to the stakeholders to

190
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:28,050
the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the industry and bring</font>

191
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:30,599
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> into as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Minister being said bring</font>

192
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,449
them into the I can't structures through

193
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,650
our engagement capabilities now a couple

194
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:40,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">of notable things on this slide we have</font>

195
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:43,260
announced<font color="#CCCCCC"> yesterday and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks to</font>

196
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:46,250
a lot of bottom-up feedback I receive

197
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:49,410
that it is time for I can to get a chief

198
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:51,900
technology officer and we have announced

199
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the job on our website yesterday and we</font>

200
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:57,480
will be adding this important role

201
00:09:53,670 --> 00:10:00,569
frankly we have had many<font color="#E5E5E5"> years without</font>

202
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,940
the CTO at I can and it's time we have a

203
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,790
leader in that area<font color="#E5E5E5"> that supports us and</font>

204
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,160
that job is now posted and I hope we

205
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:12,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">will fill it by the time we get to</font>

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">Durban we also have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be announcing</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">tomorrow that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're bringing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on board a</font>

208
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,730
new head of strategic communications he

209
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:23,400
will will report to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sally and he starts</font>

210
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,860
in mid-may and this will take the whole

211
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,040
communications function and globalize it

212
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:32,550
across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world so very pleased to also</font>

213
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,170
announce this edition now I didn't plan

214
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">to show you the slides to just talk</font>

215
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:39,479
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> people I want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show you what</font>

216
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:42,930
we're doing to make the processes behind

217
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,490
these structures much more scalable so

218
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,349
let me take an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

219
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">focus a little bit on an area that's</font>

220
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,660
maybe a little bit important to many of

221
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:54,449
you these days the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD services area so</font>

222
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,910
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into that department one of the</font>

223
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:59,760
first things we did is to build a

224
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:02,490
structure for the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD area which</font>

225
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,130
we needed in order to serve all of you

226
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,350
better the first thing we did is to

227
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,750
create a<font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

228
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,210
dns industry engagement office and we

229
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:14,750
hired a new vice president<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyrus namazi</font>

230
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:18,670
who's here with us today<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Cyrus will</font>

231
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:23,390
be owning all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the relationships with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

232
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:25,010
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD partners then in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle we</font>

233
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:27,050
built a service department a service

234
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,640
operations department that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is obviously</font>

235
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,069
responsible for all the policy

236
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,910
implementation and the service delivery

237
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:37,190
to the gTLDs and finally we're building

238
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:39,439
a true proper support function that

239
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:42,260
helps people come on board and supports

240
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,420
them now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go in a little bit more</font>

241
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,880
detail inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christine rillettes</font>

242
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,520
operations area we've broken that down

243
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,800
into functional areas each of these

244
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,660
areas have been defined we have put

245
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,589
behind each of these areas all the

246
00:11:53,660 --> 00:12:01,040
necessary processes all the necessary

247
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:04,490
tools so that we can make these areas

248
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,589
scalable so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example let me take</font>

249
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,410
transition to delegation as an example

250
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:11,870
when you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind that you can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

251
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> details of how this area works what</font>

252
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,560
are the processes they're documented

253
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:18,380
their repeatable they are trackable

254
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:22,790
they're monitored we're doing this

255
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:24,230
across I can that's what I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

256
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:27,650
share with you on the area of

257
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:31,280
structuring so yes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our season to</font>

258
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:35,360
enable<font color="#CCCCCC"> icon and enabling I can is taking</font>

259
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:38,030
three things first our<font color="#E5E5E5"> people building a</font>

260
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,910
new culture a culture that is agile a

261
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:43,550
culture that is adaptive a culture that

262
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:45,680
is global secondly maturing our

263
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,689
organization as you saw with the

264
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,550
processes and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure that allow</font>

265
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:53,000
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scale it on a global level and</font>

266
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:56,990
lastly building the<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems building the</font>

267
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,150
systems without these systems the dream

268
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:02,960
of three hubs is not going to be

269
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:05,300
feasible because if a compliance person

270
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:09,260
takes a case and then goes to sleep<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

271
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:11,540
Istanbul and then the the the

272
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,880
stakeholder calls the next morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

273
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time zone gets answered in Singapore</font>

274
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,500
if they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what happened if we</font>

275
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,060
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the systems to do that it</font>

276
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,150
will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

277
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,579
so we're deploying a true crm system a

278
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:28,010
true trouble ticketing system this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

279
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,420
happening as we speak we selected<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

280
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,790
system and it's being<font color="#E5E5E5"> configured and</font>

281
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:34,339
deployed and we will finally have the

282
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:36,560
ability for stakeholders to have their

283
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,410
trouble tickets and their calls into I

284
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,380
can logged and visible through my I can

285
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,850
and you will know the progress of your

286
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,370
communications with us that is all in

287
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:49,730
motion right now but as I note on the

288
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:52,340

291
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,330
through this and it will probably take

292
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:01,550
us at the earliest later this year in

293
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:05,360
Buenos iris to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting to the</font>

my travels our team's activities around

the world because we committed that we

303
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:42,950
had to do by action not just by talking

304
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,900
so we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and spend time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around the</font>

if you remember from the Prague meeting

312

00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:11,660
encompasses all of the key stakeholders
