itself are here these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very big</font>

73
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:28,590
numbers from our history I think the

total which is now<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2,600 was previously</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> by just a little bit but by a</font>

82
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:03,919
let me talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about themes</font>

83
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,810
overarching themes for<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can it will</font>

hear you have heard you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

85
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:12,380
hear quite a bit about<font color="#E5E5E5"> generic top-level</font>

86
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:15,230
domains it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very big effort and it</font>

87
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:18,889
is absorbing a considerable fraction of

88
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:21,440
our attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> and our resources and so</font>

89
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:24,290
it is necessarily one of our themes but

90
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,370
it is not the totality of what we're

91
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:34,130
about from a broader perspective we're

92
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:36,590
in a very important phase of moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

93
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:39,680
our early stages of just trying to get

94
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:43,099
organizing it going to developing into a

95
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,040
more stable and more solid form of

96
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:49,130
operation we are building strength we

97
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:52,040
are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build trust and work with</font>

98
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,760
others and support the community and

99
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:59,150
find a comfortable place in the entire

100
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:01,849
internet ecosystem at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we</font>

101
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:04,010
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused very much on our internal</font>

102
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,470
organization where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

103
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:09,620
develop not only accountability and

104
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:13,460
transparency but also efficiency and

105
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:15,320
effectiveness so one of the things that

106
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">you will see it is the less interesting</font>

107
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,409
less newsworthy but nonetheless

108
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,919
extremely important from my perspective

109
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:28,220
thrusts of our activity is to stabilize

110
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,969
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop to continue</font>

112

stability<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term planning and</font>

114

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,320
like I can to become less interesting

116
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:51,710
meanwhile I can't get away without

117
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,520
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the gTLD program the pace</font>

00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:35,300
now expand several fold and we will see

00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:38,629
experiments<font color="#E5E5E5"> with new business models</font>

149
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:30,289
including many other scripts around the

world Cyrillic Arabic a number of Indian

151
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:38,419
scripts and so on this will have two

152
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:41,000
effects that almost go in opposite

153
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,848
directions it will of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course as is</font>

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,019
intended broaden the accessibility of

155
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:50,899
the domain name system to a much larger

156
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:55,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">fraction of the world and it will also</font>

157
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:57,170
pose some barriers as there<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

158
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,839
communities that will understand some

159
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:03,229
but not the other and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

160
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:07,610
more bridges to build and more hurdles

161
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:10,760
to cross as we progress nonetheless this

162
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:14,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">is absolutely an important step and it</font>

163
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,100
will serve to put another fraction

164
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,390
another portion of the internet on a

165
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:22,040
global basis instead of the original

166
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:27,920
regional basis if you will

167
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:32,860

171
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:48,500
so forth we are also making incremental

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:52,610
small adjustments as we go along but one

173
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:54,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the biggest of these sort of smallest</font>

174
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,720
rumbling off the right best term but

175
00:09:54,529 --> 00:10:00,620
we're fortunate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have in fadi chehade</font>

176

industry mature itself and of helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

179
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:16,550
a qualitatively improved state over the

00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:18,019
next few years of course one of the

181
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,560
biggest things which I've alluded to

182
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:28,130
earlier is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make sure</font>

of the local business to share with you

this morning you will see on thursday

191
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:56,119
that we've made some changes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

we operate the public forum there will

before we've worked very hard

207
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:40,560
make it as uninteresting and as boring

208
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:43,410
as possible which reflects actually

209
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,900
getting the hard work of sorting out the

212
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,260
so that by the time it comes to the

of having to invent policy or invent

an orderly process and as part of that

217
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:11,790
sort of thinking we have taken note that

complicated
