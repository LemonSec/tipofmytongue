there and I know that the work obviously

102
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,190
fermentation is dependent on the wording

the recommendation which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> essential so</font>

131
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:20,998
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

132
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:26,939
would find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> a better solution on that</font>

133
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:30,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know how we can keep people educated</font>

134
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:32,939
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this regard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be helpful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

135
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:36,149
don't have a final<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but this</font>

136
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:37,800
is a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to work on and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

137
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:39,989
finally one more question<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you had to</font>

138
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,759

effectiveness committee of the board the

140
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,949
air we see on a I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a biannual</font>

141
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:49,529
basis every six months is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that something</font>

142
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:51,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was helpful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was that a burden</font>

143
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:55,800
does that help to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to organize her</font>

144
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,959
focus your work<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I would say it</font>

145
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,469
didn't matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> so so because why it</font>

146
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:05,339
didn't let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me say impact our work you</font>

147
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:07,619
know it didn't impose any any any push

148
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:10,559
you know to Tolliver like you know that

149
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:13,199
we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well in three months</font>

150
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:15,869
we have to report to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the OEC which is a</font>

151
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,569
report committee so we have to hurry<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

152
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:21,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">also know we did body had on plan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

153
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:23,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">did plan which I which had told you a</font>

154
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:26,610
reliable<font color="#CCCCCC"> can AC asset you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have</font>

155
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:28,769
and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> build on and and then when</font>

156
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,289
it came to the report<font color="#CCCCCC"> you put that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

157
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:34,529
the report but what we did in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font>

158
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:37,289
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's it and made it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

159
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:40,889
form which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it was understandable</font>

160
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:42,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see oh he sees and and also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the to</font>

161
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:46,829
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> council via to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> report to the council</font>

162
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:50,969
as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way we did so</font>

163
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:56,039
there was not any<font color="#CCCCCC"> any big push you know</font>

164
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:57,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">that he had in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> background here well</font>

165
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,099
I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all the questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

166
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:00,329
is there anything else you can think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

167
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:03,149
that you wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it advice</font>

168
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:08,819
for future chairs who<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take up</font>

169
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:12,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work yes well you know there's an</font>

170
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:16,950
ongoing discussion

171
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:19,110
by a public comments and other<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

172
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:23,010
the review process itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it's</font>

173
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:26,160
a long term it's a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> going thing so</font>

174
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:30,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I and and I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I go to an</font>

175
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:33,510
implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> again so I would try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

176
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:36,030
even to accelerate this process<font color="#E5E5E5"> so how</font>

177
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:40,860
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a question the first thing</font>

178
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:43,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">is I think like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the council when it</font>

179
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,660
comes to the review<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself it should</font>

180
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:50,220
from the beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> also think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

181
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:54,600
implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

182
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,790

00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,910
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it what is going to be done</font>

184
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,620
could it be implemented<font color="#CCCCCC"> or where would</font>

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the difficulties and on the other</font>
