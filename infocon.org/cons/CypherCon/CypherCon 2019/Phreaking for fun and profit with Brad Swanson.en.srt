1
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:26,630
This talk is freaking for fun and
profit. How we pwned the phone. If this

2
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:32,570
is not the talk you're looking for, tough
you have to sit through it. Didn't anyone tell you?

3
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,390
So who am I? My name is Brad Swanson. You can find me

4
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,500
on Twitter as the d1g1t4l_t3mpl4r. You email me if you like.

5
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,019
I'm a manager of threat intelligence in
response for a SAS provider out of San

6
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:55,220
Francisco. About 25, 26, 27ish years doing
digital security. Not all of it was, was

7
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,809
deemed digital security back in the
old days. It was just doing computer work.

8
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,839
When I was a kid, I had a very large
recreational interest in how phone

9
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,460
systems work. It was really neat to go
exploring the phone systems and find out

10
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,479
what, what things we could make them do.
When I'm not busy computering, I'm

11
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:14,539
bobbing around in my Jeep out in the
desert outside of Las Vegas where I

12
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,160
live. I love social engineering. One of my
favorite things to do outside red

13
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,720
teaming and romantic walks on the
beach while sipping Wi-Fi. So the

14
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,710
standard disclaimer. These are my
experiences, my opinions, my input, my

15
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:34,130
thoughts. In no way does this reflect the
thoughts, opinions of my employer. Most of

16
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,589
my employee doesn't know I'm here today, so awesome. And then a couple of just simple warnings, so

17
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:45,350
yeah. Sold by weight, not volume, don't inhale the fumes, etc. So we're going to cover a couple of

18
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,140
things today. We're talking about how the
phone system works, and this is going to

19
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,340
be at a very high level. We're not going
to get into a lot of the super technical

20
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,420
details because, that's really not the
point of this talk. It's going to give a

21
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,619
little background on how it works so
that folks understand some of the, some

22
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:03,409
of the other things. We're gonna talk
about types of boxes. Which covers  a

23
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:07,130
little bit of an understanding on
how the phone system worked. And how some

24
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,220
of those exploits were able to be
leveraged. We're going to talk about

25
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,989
some famous people that used to phreak.
Why did they phreak? How did they phreak?

26
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:18,680
What was they're reasoning behind
it? And I cover a couple of interesting

27
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,400
numbers. There's still some, some neat
numbers you can use for things that

28
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,540
still work today, even though a lot of the
boxes and things no longer work. And if

29
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,209
we have time the very end,
I'll go through a couple of

30
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,420
entertainment stories about some
interesting numbers and some interesting

31
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:38,989
experiences in the past. Just about the phone system and how that works. So the older,

32
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:46,250
the older phone system ran what was
called SS5. Signaling System 5. It used

33
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,690
what's called in-band signaling. So that
means that, the control challenge for the

34
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:56,120
phone system went down the same channel
as your voice. That's good. The phreakers

35
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,650
were super happy about that because it's
very easy now to send each control

36
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,340
signals right through the mouth piece.
You din't have to do any crazy high jinks to get

37
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,840
those signals in to the band. You just
play it in the mouth piece and off they go.

38
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,220
SS5 was designed to work with
intercontinental traffic. This was back

39
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:20,840
in the early days of satellite, you know.
The, the sub-oceanic cables. And so SS5

40
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,030
was, was designed for that. And it used
what's called MF tones, multi-frequency

41
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:34,010
tones. So you dial a telephone you hear
multi-tones like... Something about a

42
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,470
touch-tone phone.
These are different multi-frequency

43
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,040
tones that the phone system used for
signaling. The reason they usedd different

44
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,880
multi frequency tones, is they don't want
anybody with a touch-tone phone to be

45
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,730
able to start hacking the phone system.
They want to get them to go through some

46
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:54,079
effort. So then after SS5 started getting
just pwned all over the place, they said

47
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,360
we need to fix this, we need to come up
with something better, something more

48
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,489
robust, something much more secure. They
moved to Signaling System 7. There

49
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:06,200
was a 6 in between, but it was pretty
short lived. 7 was the big one. You still

50
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,730
find a lot of systems running SS7 now. In the big change with SS 7 is,

51
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:18,079
they took that in-band signaling away.
They took all the control frequencies,

52
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,120
all these MMF frequencies and they put
them in a separate channel. So now, you

53
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,770
can't just send tone to the mouthpiece
and then go interesting places. Now it's

54
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,760
a lot harder to do, you know. This
phreaking and the box doesn't work

55
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,389
anymore. People who phreak were not happy about it.

56
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:42,530
It made them sad. It came out around 1980. It did not roll out right away. You hear talks

57
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,568
of a lot of people. I was able to box
calls. I lived in a small town, in

58
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:55,550
Illinois. Had a small, local phone company.
We were able to box calls until 1986. So

59
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,909
yeah, it took em' a long time to roll it
out. We'll talk about why, about you

60
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:03,650
know, why it took so long in a minute here. SS7 has a very, very large vulnerability in it.

61
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,068
There's a couple of, a couple of
vulnerabilities. One of the big ones, with

62
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:11,990
SS7, you can track the cell phone user
with 70% accuracy. And that only can you

63
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:18,349
track the location of ss7 your and also
intercept and decrypt phone calls so if

64
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:22,340
you're running 4G and it's running
encryption doesn't matter that's a 70

65
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,599
you can decrypt that communication and
people have actually used that there's a

66
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:33,889
case in 2017 in Germany where criminals
use this vulnerability to bypass to

67
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:37,729
conquer and they stole money from
people's bank accounts so people would

68
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:41,180
be like I want to make this transaction
my bank the bank is going to factor the

69
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,849
following via SMS pro can intercept that
using this ss7 vulnerability so this is

70
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:51,289
an addition this is different than like
you may have heard of sim hijacking this

71
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:56,060
is yet another way that people were
intercepting to factor and it was bad

72
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,919
and they they they kind of knew it was
an issue but they didn't fix it right

73
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,479
away and no one's gonna find that well
people found it and they leveraged it so

74
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,258
just another reason why you SMS is
really a bad idea

75
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:14,150
here q-factor stuff you use a third
party app or or whatever but SMS is not

76
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,729
anybody go as I mentioned it wasn't
rolled out as quickly as people had

77
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,740
hoped it would be it's a telco hoped it
would be

78
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,259
so precursor joist you know people don't
like to explore the phone system we're

79
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:29,539
excited
you know we can keep doing this this is

80
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:34,128
coming it is near but we can still play
until the end comes so why was it so

81
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:40,099
slow to roll this out
it was slow to roll out the cost was

82
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:45,760
huge I mean it was an extremely excited
all your switches it was a great big

83
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,430
infrastructure change which costs money
there's also a court ruling that if you

84
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,320
were a phone company and you provided
service in two different ladders you had

85
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,960
to have separate infrastructure in each
ladder here not by one big that's a

86
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,310
sudden system and using that everywhere
you're hoping for one everywhere you're

87
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,730
doing business so that you know the
costs exponentially increased based on

88
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,870
that there's a lot of effort well that's
a seven there are a lot of differences

89
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,980
between have such five to ss7 so
important you just roll it out and just

90
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,640
drop it out there you know just range of
people on how it works how to use it how

91
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,510
to roll it out you have to make sure
that they understand it before it goes

92
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,590
out so and there are problems your
linemen and your people work in the

93
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,239
central office are able to fix that and
then you have the actual fiscal roll out

94
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,680
of you till they don't take these that's
this box opens out put the ss7 switches

95
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,400
in so with it with us at seven you
really roll out all these new switches

96
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,210
we need to keep phone service off while
we're doing this we can't just say okay

97
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,239
everybody you're going to being turned
off and maybe they'll be back on next

98
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,020
week when the new switches come in let's
be a staged approach so there's a lot of

99
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,280
planning involved and then there's the
maintenance of it yeah kind of spare so

100
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,179
there's more you know there's more
financial out cost for that you need to

101
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,540
make sure that again your wine men are
trained on how to maintain this

102
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,890
equipment it's not roll it out you know
set it and forget it you didn't need to

103
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,789
make sure that it keeps working because
the bones go out people freak out if

104
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,600
your cell service drops for an hour from
Verizon people are like torches and

105
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,340
pitchforks right and then they need is
there really needs you so you know

106
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,520
homecomings have a finite budget just
like all of us have a finite budget

107
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,799
where we work if there's really not a
big me they're really not driven to

108
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:36,010
spend that money and that's a seven role
Ben where I lived in central Illinois is

109
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,799
a small phone company small community
they didn't really need to roll it out

110
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,859
that's a firework but why should we
spend this money now let's wait until we

111
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:51,360
absolutely
to roll this out so sf7 kind of is

112
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,950
leading into the modern day which is boy
a lot of a lot of companies are now

113
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:01,920
using voice over IP and people still
freaked but freaker's have become more

114
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,540
hackers than preachers
so basically boy turns your handset into

115
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,930
an end point and it calls a server and
it rocks your call over the Internet to

116
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:15,599
another VoIP server often you know Sarah
has fallen so if their servers involve

117
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,120
servers gonna be hacked
you know there's following the

118
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,930
building's there's all kinds a man
should suit any server whether it's a

119
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,959
white server and exchange box or or
what-have-you

120
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:32,070
in fact there was a Melbourne based void
company rolled out point servers didn't

121
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,910
panel there's some bad ball and
abilities that came out on these servers

122
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,319
they didn't patch and their servers got
popped well as soon as it serves you

123
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,160
popped the the bad guys get on the
guitar equipment share this information

124
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,500
there's a white provider in Egypt got
ahold of these credentials for this

125
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,190
company in Melbourne started routing all
their web traffic through this company

126
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,400
in Melbourne the benefits of the
Egyptian company they're still charging

127
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,199
their customers the same rate you know
it's in a costume for much of this fall

128
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,839
but then has painting point beats
because they're routing it off the

129
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,220
melbourne servers box the Melbourne
server was still response from the bills

130
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,860
because the bills always have to be paid
that's their the phone coming that bill

131
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,760
always has to be paid they ended up
writing him over a hundred thousand

132
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,450
dollars just the company in Egypt not
counting all the miscellaneous smaller

133
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,140
people that are going in and taking
advantage of this and that come to and

134
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,370
out of business six months later because
of this there's another company that

135
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,270
said hey we're not going to take Chandra
to set up our own our own voyage system

136
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,890
we're gonna manage it ourselves we're
gonna take care of it and we'll know

137
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,490
that sure well make sure it gets patched
as soon as the patch comes out we're

138
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,440
gonna patch it we're not gonna make the
same mistake that Melbourne did except

139
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:54,440
one of their Edmonds on that box reused
password $25,000 on authorized calls and

140
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:01,010
they yeah because only companies want
their money if you've ever had

141
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,589
erroneous charges on a phone bill and
ever tried to get those four movies you

142
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:09,839
know how hard it is the phone company a
million okay hey that pillows have to be

143
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,830
have to be paid we're gone so who makes
the phone company's income knocking for

144
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:20,640
it so modern-day freaks are really
computer hackers more so than that maybe

145
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,970
the priests of old or more electronics
each sort of so instead of a time a new

146
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,959
era that we're going into with with Boyd
and butch is gonna get bigger and bigger

147
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,040
treat go so it's gonna it's gonna
continue to expand the the happiness

148
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,870
skill set if you will of the modern-day
folks so some of us said this is kind of

149
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,670
an overview of how the phone since
weren't sent again a super high level

150
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:51,120
the main thing to do wait a minute SS 5
SS 5 please like it so people sort of

151
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,320
make me these boxes to do crazy stuff on
the phone system Bell used to like to

152
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,550
bread and toot their own horn they had a
thing called the Bell technical journal

153
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,430
and they would publish articles in it
hey this is how we're doing this look

154
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,160
how cool we are
awesome oh where we figured out here

155
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,900
look to publish an article on then there
really some technical specs on how the

156
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:16,079
phone system signaling worked in a 1960
issue of this technical journal all

157
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,180
these engineering type and electronics
type of people back in the 60s got ahold

158
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,930
of this started reading annoying well
they just gave us a key to the kingdom

159
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:31,260
right here this explains how everything
works so we had a small group of people

160
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,170
that were they were playing with the
phone system and then exploring I'm

161
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:40,229
trying to find what happens if I do this
where does that go Esquire found out

162
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:44,490
that there are people in this kind of
underground little crew doing this with

163
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,430
the phone system as far as like we
should do an article Esquire was a

164
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,510
gentlemen's magazine
there was around back then but they're

165
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,670
still around or not they were not huge
on like pages and pages and they

166
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,819
interviewed all these famous phone
creeps back to maintain and said hey how

167
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,080
does this work show us and this reporter
went and would hang out with these

168
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,620
individuals and they would take him out
late at night and do things

169
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:13,279
hey challenge home bones they would show
them that the very nitty-gritty nuts and

170
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,000
bolts of all this worked Prince
individual wrote an article very

171
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,290
detailed article you know Blaine
Johnson's names to protect poets but

172
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:29,449
that was it so then everybody because
it's in this national publication so

173
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:35,480
basically that blue box works and the
blue box was was the the main focus of

174
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,630
this article so if you're below twenty
six hundred Hertz tone into a phone it

175
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,770
would capture the trunk and basically
what it does it tell us whatever number

176
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,750
you're calling have hung up so you just
true twenty six hundred Hertz it

177
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,990
releases the trunk but as soon as you
stop blowing that you seize that trunk

178
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:59,089
again so now you have control of this
trunk they use twenty six hundred Hertz

179
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:03,500
because it's not in a normal speech
pattern like you and accent law 2600

180
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,930
Hertz who's talking somebody on the
phone your boy 2600 Hertz on a call you

181
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:14,000
maybe call 50 6070 miles away so you get
outside your data you blow that 2,600

182
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,600
Hertz tone the other end things you come
home what you call an 800 numbers that's

183
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,850
hanging a billion that 800 things you've
hung up releases the trunk well then you

184
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,570
stop blowing and you cease that trunk
again and now you can send a key press

185
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:32,600
signal KP and a number and then s key
what you start and it dials that call

186
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,760
she could call London you can call China
you could call your neighbor next door

187
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,630
you can call another phone in your house
doesn't matter

188
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,240
pretty said okay that's cool but what
can we do let's play with it let's

189
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,480
explore you only have this inquisitive
minds that we want to know what we did

190
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,950
what else we can do how does it work so
they would start stacking trunks they

191
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,680
would say okay I can take I can go from
here to London to Brisbane

192
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:05,989
to Kenya to Canada to South America to
New York see the benefit of that and the

193
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,589
freaks that just plain didn't have that
niche wanna see them to do it they

194
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:14,810
didn't have an ulterior motive for it
you can call phone numbers you get all

195
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,099
set out special codes in the phone
company you could become a directory

196
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,000
assistance operator so $70 five five
five one two one two let me get the

197
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,940
operator they get you and then you just
mess with them and have fun no the other

198
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,550
thing you can do is you dial internal
codes that would give you what's called

199
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,329
a verification line so in the old days
if you're trying to call something if

200
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:39,380
I'm trying to call my coworker Brandon
or Hana in the lines busy

201
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,420
for hours I can have the operator break
into that call and say excuse me if

202
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:49,339
Brett's finding an emergency phone call
can you please clear the line those

203
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:52,610
verification lines you can just click
into that and just listen and not say

204
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:57,350
anything this is kind of a very very
very early form combining some some

205
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,550
other numbers of the phone company of
daxing you listen an eye on a call learn

206
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:05,810
things about people so it was pretty
scary stuff for people to be able to do

207
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:12,079
that I'll give you could set trunks all
around preach did it just because it was

208
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,110
fun because it could and it was cool to
hear that I feel like you could call

209
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,580
yourself on another phone after stacking
it several times you can say hello and

210
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,060
like three percent Slayer you hear
yourself on it oh I need you to stock

211
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,920
yourself back and forth we're all kind
of introverts right so who better to

212
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,689
call than yourself yeah and structure
real humans that way the Vegas syndicate

213
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,750
found out about those blue boxes they
said wait a second okay there's

214
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,990
potential for this you can stack clunk
and you can bounce calls and you can

215
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,950
call an 800 number my phone bill shows
that I called an 800 number but I'm

216
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:48,170
really calling someone replace what
better use for blue boxes and bookies

217
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,709
but these don't want the cops or anybody
to know what they're calling they want

218
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:54,649
the feds to come in and rate and get
their phone records and say oh well you

219
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:58,220
know they they've called all these
people let's you invest it all these

220
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:04,510
people for illegal gambling that's sad
let's let Chuck go to sleep

221
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:18,959
I'm new at this skinny time I told you
my password so the Vegas crime syndicate

222
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,189
said we need to miss blue boxes we want
when we get raided we want more like

223
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:27,660
week all the time and temperature 800
number and Phoenix and that's it all

224
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,490
right the Phoenix time and temperature
place let's not have them raid our other

225
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,390
bookies are calling or our other
criminal associates let's also make it

226
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,340
very hard for me to trace our phone
calls if I call from here to Madison and

227
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,540
they started traced they've got it
almost instantly but if I take that call

228
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:50,159
and I call London and then I bounced
that to Paris and then to Tokyo and then

229
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,420
I'm done to Brisbane and then I'm up to
San Francisco and then Madison that's a

230
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,860
lot harder for them to trace out because
they're tracing each tandem that I've

231
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:05,250
bounced that across so the mob was like
we need these they placed an order with

232
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,410
a gentleman he went by algo el
Gilbertson but that's not his real name

233
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:15,630
he was making blue box isn't selling we
settle for $1,500 a piece to people in

234
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,440
the late sixties early seventies that
wasn't trying to change her just a low

235
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:30,390
electronic box the mob comes oasiz 1360
peace dawn so I had that order he

236
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:34,350
doesn't ever say whether he actually
delivered on that and got paid by them

237
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:40,559
that's kind of a question and that
actually went through but suppose we it

238
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,870
didn't she here we have some examples of
blue boxes the one on the far left a

239
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,409
large one this is one of the earliest
blue boxes this is actually in a museum

240
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,179
and I've waited Sydney Australia and
that's what it look like it was a keypad

241
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:58,140
I had to come with extra buttons on it
for doing the 2600 Hertz tone and for

242
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,740
doing the the key press and the start
and then a little mouthpiece you just

243
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:07,770
hold all my speakers sorry they can hold
up to the mouthpiece of the phone blue

244
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,820
box are illegal they're very illegal so
people in disguise here's a blue box the

245
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,870
size is a calculator
hello charging I like old calculators

246
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,050
you could plug in so it had a charging
jet

247
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,980
tap the calculator you'd plug your
speaker into that if the cops showed up

248
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,680
you unplug your speaker you chuck it and
you've got your blue box yeah I know

249
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:31,080
it's just a calculator officer cops like
have a nice day see you this is a new

250
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,449
blue box this is actually built off an
Arduino

251
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,890
no blue box is no longer worth here or
pretty much anywhere because of the new

252
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:42,060
signal switch I mean you might be able
to use it in some faraway place but what

253
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,020
about is really not working or it's just
a just a project it's more of a

254
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,740
nostalgia thing so many peridot how to
make blue boxes using Arduino you look

255
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,400
smart we know libraries you know this
keypad on the right he's got to ditch

256
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,600
key buy some components and the other
blue box again does it work but it's

257
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,899
cool just to have to play with them to
talk about conversation piece that's

258
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,980
blue box
any questions on blue boxing hey so

259
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,900
there's a black box a black box was used
going the other direction see blue boxes

260
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,730
you make calls out for free a black box
would allow incoming calls to be free so

261
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,380
the phone company there are two relays
in switch one control billing and one

262
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,390
control ring so I've been calling
somebody else they could use a black box

263
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:32,310
and what it would do is normally when
you pick up your phone your line voltage

264
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:36,360
when it's raining drops from that 48
bowl constant not about 10 volts and

265
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,919
that's what trip so it's realized to say
okay make the phone stopped ringing and

266
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,330
let's start billing for this call back
then everything was by minion welcome to

267
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:50,550
one of their money using a couple of
caps a resistor a Zener diode you can

268
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:55,050
make this black box it would hold that
line bolt to tie enough we're going to

269
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,680
trip the relay to stop the ringing so
wasn't driving in Sandy Creek want to

270
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,430
talk to the person but it wasn't enough
to trip that billing relay so that

271
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,950
building real I would never trip as far
as a phone company thought your phone's

272
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,460
ringing and raining and raining in any
and this is before the days where

273
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,330
everybody had voicemail or you know
answering machines so this time and

274
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,939
having fallen drink 30 40 times if
you're trying to get a hold of somebody

275
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,140
see could get a quick quick message back
and forth pretty easily it was one way

276
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,470
so work to people called you wouldn't
work if you called out you'd still be

277
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:27,600
billed normally and these are actually
created by an ex-felon point his name

278
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,240
was John Draper
it was by Captain Crunch he was there

279
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,600
so figured out that these little toy
whistles that you got in boxes the

280
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,770
Captain Crunch in the late sixties would
actually blow up 2600 Hertz telling that

281
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:45,460
you talked about the blue boxes and it
was a it sounds kind of loud but sound

282
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:55,480
like this I'm right-handed about 2600
person he peered out he didn't still

283
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,559
phone calls with that um we're gonna
talk a little bit more what John later

284
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:02,649
it's kind of a cross-table individual
because of some stuff I'm going about

285
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:11,130
today I don't yeah so black box free
calls then any question that black boxes

286
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:17,559
red boxes first and foremost it is still
illegal to possess a red box if you have

287
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:23,800
used it with nefarious intent aka to
defraud the phone company right Bob just

288
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,909
don't work anymore because it's at 7 but
it's still along the book challenge it's

289
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:33,850
a legal tire horse outside the tavern on
a Tuesday afternoon um ten years in

290
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:38,080
prison if you have a red box they
actually arrested somebody that worked

291
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:45,428
for 2600 magazine in New York Bernie ass
his real name was Ed Cummings he had a

292
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:51,040
red box didn't even work that's what a
red box Oh red box that you generate

293
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,909
coin tones to a payphone nickels dimes
quarters so the paper one thinks you're

294
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:59,410
putting coins in when you're really not
you have to change the processing

295
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:05,280
crystal out this is a RadioShack pocket
tone dialer it comes with a 3.5

296
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,330
megahertz processor crystal and so when
you turned out you didn't store all the

297
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:15,939
numbers in and it makes it easy because
you can use dial a phone number if you

298
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,300
were to and I would never possess an
illegal red box because

299
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,800
illegal was about to sir illegal but if
you were to take one of these and swap

300
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:29,980
out that processing crystal and play
five like asterisks with that new

301
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,510
processing crystal Oh

302
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,240
Mustard's a glitch everybody uh it would
generate a quarter-ton to a payphone so

303
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,200
if you're called Zimbabwe and they're
like $12 for the first minute you would

304
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:52,660
just never knew live get less every time
you do that it's not important people

305
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:57,920
say don't never do that just make sure
to just add risks never never use a red

306
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,510
box illegal ten years Ernie had one he
didn't have that crystal yet it's

307
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,530
Saturday then he just had this in a
crystal that's like having a gun and a

308
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,470
bullet not in the gun and they charge
you for murder

309
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,860
he made a year and a half in prison
Peggle prison

310
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:18,169
yeah beat up pretty bad he was doing
strange things to the bone and president

311
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,670
making some phone calls and a larger
meaner and made that was in there for

312
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,640
far worse crimes than Bernie was he what
were wanting to use the Fallen brains

313
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,510
like let me just wrap up real quick
didn't you connect your phone apparently

314
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,450
that wasn't good enough of the guy so he
proceeded to knock burned it down and

315
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,800
stopped the space and broken space up
pretty bad busted his arm he was in

316
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,270
intensive care global Bob it was there
could I make an example of Bern he

317
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,690
released the pictures of Secret Service
agents Secret Service's not pleased

318
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,950
about that so the Secret Service kind of
for the book Ottoman and best of them

319
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:55,550
pretty good services actually the one
that enforces us so let's not worry

320
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,680
about kind of Atlanta
let's not worry about we're telling the

321
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,420
president let's go up Dropbox it doesn't
even work anymore because you know

322
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:08,480
that's where the threat is so the the
quarter tone nickels and dimes

323
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,810
they're their combination remember we
talked about multi frequency to

324
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:17,690
frequencies so it's seventeen hundred
Hertz at 2200 Hertz a nickel is one a

325
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:24,200
diamond to headquarters five so he can't
see a nickel dime quarter that's all

326
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,110
that's all baseball and they work really
good you had to be careful how you use

327
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:35,990
that ceiling to pop by an operator and
third times I'll pop by an operator

328
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:41,210
operator come on how much money did you
actually put in $1 and then like welcome

329
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,990
try putting in real money not using your
silly box or I'll call security the bail

330
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,530
trucks on the way
the nearest bail office is 200 miles

331
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:54,320
okay you sit on down
oh wait for them um so the telco to find

332
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,230
way to combat that's what they did is
they started on like payphones they

333
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,830
would mute the mouthpiece until you put
all your money I'm gonna call and then

334
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,649
they would unmute that mouthpiece so you
couldn't hold this up to the pole and

335
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,679
play the tones people drown ways around
that as well

336
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:11,330
they cut into the wires coming out of
the box and then beep tones in there so

337
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:16,370
yeah so red boxes super fun no longer
work stole illegal any questions about

338
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:21,918
red boxes everybody has questions you
have to talk to a pretty tribe you dial

339
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,130
yet the Wisconsin happy history village
come see me one have to talk about this

340
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,669
stuff while you play with it explain how
this mysteriously makes weird taunt

341
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:35,929
randomly then we have the beige box a
beige box is basically it's a buck set

342
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:38,929
for people can't afford about set or
can't steal one out of a Southwestern

343
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:48,230
Bell trunk this Amazon so my old one
home one day and you know but super nice

344
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:52,250
for fighting all what number you're
calling from if you wanted to get into

345
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:58,040
something let's say the statute of
limitations in Illinois is let's say you

346
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,540
want to get into the modem at the local
pizza just to play just to explore you

347
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,168
go to their their ta9
or like the telephone now we're gonna

348
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:10,100
make a little telephone box and outside
the building you open it up you put then

349
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,918
and you dial a number and we'll tell you
what number you're calling from

350
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:16,910
oh okay now we have all these numbers
for all these lines I mean the pizza I'm

351
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,820
gonna start getting all those with my
modem and should I find kids a lot of

352
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,379
time rather than Warren Island the
entire exchange so beige but and these

353
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,210
are these are integers so I mean it's
not bad

354
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:30,650
70 80 bucks but you know if your if
you're a young freak and you're broke

355
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:35,090
that's a lot of money so people get
these cheap one piece $9.00 Walmart

356
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:39,590
bones one piece for the court and you
set it down and hangs up they make beige

357
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,309
boxes out of those you cut the module
plug off you put a couple of alligator

358
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:48,770
clips on the wires and now it's
basically the same exact unit you plug

359
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:53,870
those alligator clips in
there you go about set alignment set

360
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:58,229
here use it not only at the outside of a
building or a business or a house at the

361
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:02,550
network interface box you're gonna
telephone can that down at the corner of

362
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:08,639
the street clip into that if you're in
an office area you can clip in the punch

363
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,590
down blocks any anywhere that you could
catch a phone signal multiple uses for a

364
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:19,169
beige box right you could clip on the
while ahead of it if you're a jerk you

365
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,690
go to somebody's house you go by the
line you make a long-distance call

366
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,960
alright I made this call this person's
getting billed for it it's kind of

367
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,670
crappy do just eats up on people okay my
my external promoter and I'm like a

368
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:38,400
creepy stalker weirdo my co-founder
lying on the sue she's talking to stuff

369
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,640
like that
hiding your captive fraudulent calls so

370
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,260
if you want to maybe make your twenties
people it still try to cards you want

371
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,850

372
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:54,899
that I did that you catch that a stolen
car that back tracks it it's run of that

373
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:00,270
house and not yours you can also use it
with a blue box so you use this this

374
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,960
beige box you clip onto a phone line and
now you're gonna start blue box recalls

375
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,340
if the telco catches on to you and they
try and back trace where this blue box

376
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:13,379
call came from yeah it's gonna miss
house over here maybe whenever did

377
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,670
something like that would tip about it
if they weren't complete jerks they

378
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:21,930
would try and find like an eight year
old lady tie into her house because when

379
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:25,200
the poem come he comes and says you've

382
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,640

go to somebody else and these but you

384
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,830
know you said neutral hard to combine
different price you got them these are

385
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,560
expensive sometimes you'd find a Bella
truck that was unlocked

386
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:52,139
unlike belt racks were awesome to the
hallways at manuals you'd spent an hour

387
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,880
at a none one mellotron no truck in the
middle of the night with a

388
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,929
with a camel and just start taking
pictures of manuals but the man you

389
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:03,080
about your home you film developing I
have a copy of the important pages out

390
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,939
of that manual not really unlike some of
the pictures that we're all taking here

391
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:13,820
today as we pack badges and trying to
coach the caption con same same kind of

392
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:19,909
theory I'm just older and more
old-school because it's about you

393
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,730
usually you wouldn't find something that
said I'm like all talk every day

394
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:28,780
who's the bonus but again at that point
here to get criminal justice feel

395
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,740
two big bucks any questions about phase
fronts and lassitude assault pretty

396
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:42,610
quick again if anybody comes up with any
questions that's what that pump me down

397
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,610
there's the example the beige box
everybody needs like elf super cheapo

398
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,320
phones some of us some only these things
in the past absolute garbage but they

399
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,530
weren't good further for doing page
boxing cheering it's put some alligator

400
00:30:54,530 --> 00:31:00,440
clips on the end and off they go - guten

00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,120
end here reach out to me I'm more than
happy to send to slide that collective

407
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,989
poem so he just want to copy the link
second I can let you know those as well

408
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:34,460
so that's probably did an article in 71
that really opened the doors for a lot

409
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,720
of people the LA Times said we can't be
out come by as far we need your on an

410
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,700
article so they did one and 71 are the
Wall Street Journal in 76 dozen articles

411
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,720
so there there's a lot of coverage
there's a lot of big-name publications

412
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,549
there were telling people how to do this
this telephone from so a lot of people

413
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:59,480
right this is kind of cool some of these
people you know wise the jobs so Steve

414
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,280
Wozniak read the article in Esquire and
watch was very technical he was a

415
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,030
builder guy you know why is this guy
that build stuff and Jobs was a guy

416
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,678
that's
old stuff so I was reading this article

417
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:17,159
he gets super jazzed she's like half way
through because of jobs and says oh my

418
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,830
gosh yet your countries article they
talk about the state and I'm pretty sure

419
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,070
it's fiction I'm pretty sure it's a
made-up article but you got to read it

420
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:26,970
it's so cool to be sauce with this word
so they read it and they got excited

421
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:31,890
they went to the Berkeley library and
they did some reading and they found out

422
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:36,690
that all the Articles that made up these
tones actually work so wise builds the

423
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:41,789
first blue marks so trouble making it
work so he gets all of the giant Draper

424
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:46,490
who's mentioned in the article the
Captain Crunch guy John goes and visits

425
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,730
Steve and Steve and says oh you're doing
it wrong I mean let me show you how to

426
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:55,710
do this teaching them how to blue box
well at that point was a jobs like this

427
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,730
is something big they start building
like Y starts just cranking out blue

428
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:03,240
boxes and jobs start selling them on
campus other students hey you want a way

429
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:09,299
to make three phone calls will say this
box well I'll teach how to use it the

430
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:14,158
sales from their blue boxes gave them
the startup capital to start Apple

431
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,210
computers this is where they had the
money to build the Apple one so if it

432
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:23,159
weren't for blue boxing then freaks
none of that iPhones or iMac sure iPads

433
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:31,350
or iPods or any high things they were
they were so jazzed about it and some of

434
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:38,908
their some of their actual direct quotes
are like Waze says of all the articles

435
00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:42,630
I've ever read in my life the Esquire
articles here's a little blue box was

436
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:46,919
the one that affected my life the most
every day but that's true right because

437
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,909
they read this they started getting
money they start Apple and look at these

438
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:55,980
guys now I mean apples does a huge I
mean it all started because they read an

439
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,559
article in a magazine and built the
little box I was on a job says

440
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:06,809
experience like experiences like that
taught us the power of ideas that sounds

441
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:12,060
jobs like doesn't it if we hadn't have
had those blue box experiences there

442
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:16,290
never would have been an Apple Computer
so yeah that's fine maybe think about

443
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,639
how big Apple is now in
how many places Apple is and the fact

444
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:23,300
that it all started from wash picking up
an armored car pick up a magazine

445
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,710
reading article one night it's kind of
neat to see that that that transgression

446
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:35,510
off transitional it's been a long day so
the abilities box they gain confidence

447
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,360
hey we're good all the times we made
this thing it works we can do stuff with

448
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:43,610
it it's cool we explore stuff this is
fun we like this good small jazz and

449
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:48,620
it's at that point we can change the
world and they did which is very cool

450
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,520
and again you know Draper worked with
was and the very beginning of times to

451
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:58,850
kind of teach him the ropes and they say
to touch in fact Draper ended up working

452
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:03,350
for Apple and between prison stints
writing some softer form but that's

453
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:10,250
another story we'll get to that
Oh Rhett not so uh my apologies that you

454
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:15,650
have a temper but it's actually John
great brother how Carl got it so he goes

455
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:19,490
by Captain Crunch because again he was
the individual to discover that the was

456
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:23,169
soul football 2600 Hertz you get blue
box with it

457
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:27,200
here's in the Air Force you're stationed
up in Alaska I've never been to Alaska

458
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,740
but I'm assuming there's not a whole lot
to doing a lot of stuff so John had a

459
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,000
lot free time on his hands he would get
like all Air Force radios or treat him

460
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,200
and build them up and make things he
made some radio stations he started

461
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,020
teaching other servicemen to these
dinners how to make free calls from

462
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,500
Alaska because back then was expensive
to call from Alaska back on the mainland

463
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,780
because the telephone company always
gets paid there's a blind individual

464
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,980
named Ginny Theresa it turns out that
there is a large group of blind freaks

465
00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:00,230
back then Denny
contacts challenges hey we want you to

466
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,310
build this electronic box for us and
it's going to generate these weird tones

467
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:09,620
build this so john built on the blue box
then he found after building the blue

468
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:14,960
box learning about the challenge he
found out about the whistle the Esquire

469
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,210
article he was interviewed and
mentioned his name in the article as a

470
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:24,069
result in 1972 he was arrested for toll
fraud as a telephone company have always

471
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:27,310
been paid and were since the five years
probation

472
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:35,319
easy peasy right well not really my job
he meets he teaches laws have box was

473
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:38,319
like oh you're a cool guy like you know
I can work for Apple

474
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:44,109
she Johnson yeah he went to work for
Apple and and wrote Easy Rider much like

475
00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:49,089
an earlier word processor never got paid
what he was supposed to and they had

476
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:53,799
kind of a falling out he also wanted to
make charlie boxes for the Apple it

477
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,460
would allow you it's kind of a modem
that would allow you to call wats line

478
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:02,170
watch lines like eight hundred-number
said they're called inbound wats it

479
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:07,150
wouldn't be a way to talk have your
computer talk to these wats lines that

480
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:11,589
point in time woz and jobs like modems
and there's not really cool no one's

481
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:15,790
really gonna like talking to other
computers that much not to read about

482
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:21,490
that and a couple years later Draper
sold his charlie box idea to another

483
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,049
company announced used in like voicemail
systems and then all kinds of stuff

484
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:30,490
again he didn't get credit for it and so
deputies took it he couldn't stop boxing

485
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:35,709
on couldn't stop explain the phone
system so he he continued to explore and

486
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:41,980
continue to get caught so he saw prison
sentences in 1976 and 1978 both times

487
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:48,130
for toll fraud he's very well known all
the freaks new Captain Crunch was they

488
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:53,520
would call him in the middle of the
night just to talk to him he was

489
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,859
eccentric
always has been kind of eccentric often

490
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:04,150
felt he's being watched people would
come up and his first goodness this is

491
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,060
like being traced who are you recalling
from why trauma

492
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:13,480
it's very paranoid you and then do you
like strange conversations with some of

493
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,920
the people that call them um recently
he's been accused of some stuff hasn't

494
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,930
been convicted but there are enough
accusations that I heels in the same

495
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:27,460
town I do it
come on Mia so um he claims he and two

496
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:31,900
other freaks to bring out all phone
services the entire you us he like a lot

497
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:38,410
of like kind of out there there is an
ideas some people again maybe bit of

498
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,549
take a lot more than two other freaks
yeah but uh a large group could drop all

499
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,660
the phone systems but it'd be more than
three people and basically they were

500
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,410
just stacked all the clumps and busy out
all the trunks in the whole you guys I

501
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:56,080
don't think a lot of people would do
that brings us to Joe Joe and rested in

502
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,040
jr. he's also known as Whistler anybody
hadn't seen the movie sneakers with

503
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,290
Robert Redford and the movie sneakers
there's a Whistler that character was

504
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:10,660
based off of Joe and Gracia loosely Joe
is born blind he had perfect pitch he

505
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,890
could whistle any note perfectly he was
really into the telephone he was blind

506
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:20,230
he was left without like a babysitter uh
he his dad didn't laugh when he would I

507
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:24,280
think before he's even born his racist
by his mom shouldn't work full time to

508
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,859
be able to take care of the ball so he
was just left all of this babysitter

509
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:31,450
that really didn't give a crap about you
sooner and entertain yourself yeah so

510
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:34,990
you do that he would start calling
people at like four years old and start

511
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:39,220
playing on the phone he'd call like like
time and temperature numbers just to

512
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,990
hear people just to have some sort of
interaction with something because all

513
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:49,750
the way up he's blind he's lost one
sense he wanted that that contact that

514
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:53,200
he wasn't getting it from human so let's
play the phone the phone will he's

515
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,180
talked to me I can call random people
and talk to him at five years old he

516
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,379
turn on a switch tricked I'll switch
your dialing on on an older phone that

517
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,130
has like a handset that you actually
hang up on the receiver there there's

518
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:09,760
two buttons that come up and the handset
pushes down when you hang up you can

519
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,660
take those in Tampa min dial phone
number that's a whole styling paste is

520
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,170
what it is even if your phone is set the
tone holes will still work so if you

521
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:23,609
want to dial up read a five would be if
you're ready you dial the phone that way

522
00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:28,150
so he's charged payment but then it's
760 funnies time a temperature numbers

523
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,700
he's seven years all these Lizzy's
numbers about this point they're

524
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,109
starting
kind of all she like whistles coats

525
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:40,330
ovens listen hamster whistle at 2600
Hertz ton the recording stops he's a

526
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:44,210
that's weird
hangs up he calls it back maybe this is

527
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:49,100
a seven-year-old kid and the guy was a
genius had an IQ I thinking like 172

528
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:56,000
he's a smart smart dude so he calls her
back and say oh he's fine now what was I

529
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,570

according goes dead shows up oh I'm onto
something if I whistled this song why

531
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,450
and then he calls with the phone company
and says hey so I called this number and

532
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:15,230
I was listening this song and it made
the line drop and I noticed when I

533
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:20,350
whistled his song it was like the et
above middle C iana a piano

534
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:24,770

a babysitter and off they went
capture the central office he was blind

543
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,950
so he's feeling all of these things to
kind of understand how it worked and did

544
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:12,020
that help drive that interest of the
phone company that Joe had so you became

545
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:16,280
very well-known people would call him a
Nightwing like multiple precone every

546
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,570
night just say so it's so cool to meet

547
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:24,680
privilege on the BLA yeah that's kind of
like you're you're walking to the hotel

548

that's that's kind of how how Joe was he

551
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,560
would call mom and that was his form of
communicating with the outside world

552
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,680
that was that was how he just kept
himself entertained

553
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:50,618
he went to school down in the University
of South Florida and everybody likes

554
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:55,180
because of his phone phreaking ability
right so he's that desperate left her

555
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:58,540
some of my self-worth my value comes
from I'm gonna help all my fellow

556
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:03,820
students get free phone calls he starts
helping them get free calls and gets

557
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:10,630
busted toll fraud it doesn't do anything
have a couple of days we waited sitting

558
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:15,310
judge gets out people want to get a job
at AT&T ATT's if you got busted we're

559
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:19,270
not hiring you so much work for a small
child code Memphis and loved it did that

560
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:25,390
for a number of years then moved to
Minneapolis he had some emotional stuff

561
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:30,129
going on they all do who doesn't right
but he wanted to be a five year old kid

562
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:33,520
again there was a happy time in his life
for him now he was playing at the phone

563
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,100
system had busted and so he declared
himself to be fine and changed his name

564
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,339
to Joy bubbles
some people enormous joy what was some

565
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:47,380
homeless was there some homeless Joe and
he ended up dying of congestive heart

566
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:52,330
failure and Minneapolis as as a kid here
look out the then it was it was like

567
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:59,200
there's a child and enjoyed it so don't
you go to sleep again alright so those

568
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,850
are a couple of famous people that that
kind of got freaking where it is or

569
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:08,230
where it was a couple of years ago it's
just some cool number so we used to play

570
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:13,810
with loops so a little bit a telephone
company test number there's two sides

571
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:16,630
you look my high side and the low side
he called one side you hear a tone to

572
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:20,290
call the other side to hear nothing when
he called his two side you get connected

573
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,980
to whoever's on the other side she
freaked should use this a lot of these

574
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,760
loops because their access number didn't
build even though it was in some weird

575
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,290
area code you'd call them be an on
supervised number like the building one

576
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:40,660
kick in so if I wanted to talk to my
friend Dave who is in San Francisco and

577
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,410
I'm in New York
none of us wants to pay for that call

578
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:48,069
phone company always gets paid unless
it's a phone company's own number sort

579
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,950
of call loop number we be can actually
talk to free wouldn't cost

580
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:56,259
Lewton still exists you can still find
roots and certain exchangers I'm gonna

581
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:01,630
talk about some of those in a second
here there's also a Mac and a ni ni is

582
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:05,380
what your caller ID runs off of
announces the number that you're calling

583
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:14,440
from Enoch is is the same type of thing
but it's it's a more base level it's

584
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,700
much harder to scoop a Mac than a night
a night they make fall until the spoon a

585
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:23,290
night for you a Mac still works so if
you're ever had a phone and you can use

586
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,920
this not only for nefarious freaking
purposes but if you're if you're

587
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,220
installing some phone lines at work and
you're punching stuff down about I don't

588
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:34,870
remember what line this says plug it
with a little etc summit and call it a

589
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:38,770
night number and I'll read the number of
activity or calling from super handy or

590
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,170
if you're trying to have a local Pizza
Hut and you're in their telephone

591
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,870
network box calling a night number
trying to find out what the phone

592
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:47,440
numbers are saying is formed with your
motivator if Saturday is a toll-free a

593
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,830

596
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:07,090
Anderson number if you call that number
it will read back your number it will

597
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:12,010
not give you the MPA or the area code
but if you know like where you're at

598
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:15,870
when you're calling it you kind of know
the area code is there at a place some

599
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:20,380
then there's called the birders you can

cool exchanges nine five eight nine

615
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:28,710
fifty-nine and most area codes those are
reserved as telephone types exchanges so

618
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,240
the telephone company uses for testing
loops will be in ninety five eight nine

622
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:56,009
part of an urban legend and kind of I
don't know how true it is I've never

623
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,740
been able to verify myself because I
don't have a number and I've enjoyed I

624
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:04,080
want to find the number but there's
exchange eight four oh it worked in

several different area codes it was a
specific number after the eight four oh

626
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:14,069
it was only one or two numbers in that
entire eight poro dialing range that

627
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:19,170
actually reached somebody and it turned
