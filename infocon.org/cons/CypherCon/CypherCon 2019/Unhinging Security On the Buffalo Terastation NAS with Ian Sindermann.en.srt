1
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:26,180
We're going to be faced looking at the
Buffalo station. Where this Mach number

2
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,920
is, cocked name is unhinging security on
the Buffalo care safety pass. We'll find

3
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,739
out why it was ff9 second. I just the
obligatory Who am I Section. My name is Ian

4
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:39,739
Sindermann.
I work for tenant security evaluators..

5
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:45,680
Your security or application level
security audits. I kind of grew up as a

6
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,500
traveling performer sort of thing. I live in a bus. I like to hack. I think our mission

7
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,440
at obscura, I like to share what I find.
So again, ISC, so we do black box,

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,459
white box, security developer, secure
development, all the good stuff.

9
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,780
More importantly, we recently came out
with IC labs. Which is the research

10
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:12,050
division and we started the SoCo 2.0
project. Where we have refined our sofa,

11
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:17,750
sofa 1.0 project. Where we essentially
took a little bit IP garbage and found

12
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:24,979
out what is how terrible it all is. So this time, we found over at CVS of so far and this

13
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:30,020
device was one we poked at. So the
device itself does the interrogation

14
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,548
whatever model number that is, we'll find
out in a second. The model number

15
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:38,630
there. It's kind of a soho, slash enterprise thing. They call it business

16
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,630
grade. It's rather expensive. Also, we
don't call it business grade. Again we'll

17
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:50,089
find out first hand has an admin
interface, give it a web application.

18
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:55,250
Is kind of my bread and butter, so it got
my attention pretty quick. But, why do we

19
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,360
care? Like this IT garbage is all
over the place.

20
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,960
The thing about this device, is that
demonstrates a few key concepts  all around.

21
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,840
More importantly, key concepts that apply to anyone looking to get into performing

22
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,970
application security assessments. We're
just looking to break a IP devices and

23
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,200
move on for profit. Your choice'
Something like approaching an unknown

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,709
place. How small mistakes you have very, very large impacts. An abstraction can

25
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:29,640
scare those mistakes, but as we shall know
series over series, there's no security.

26
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,599
There's also recently the Maryland
Democratic Party. Apparently they have

27
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:40,089
all the data on a parasation among
Internet. And then pretty much every

28
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,220
other country counted. Some was in the
news. Also, over it shells, district shells

29
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:51,970
and the defender responses. So then again,
but we'll get there. So... we'll probably

30
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,829
really intrigued with this device, it was our
first interaction. Where we encountered a

31
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:02,500
lot. So the NAS can be locked and it
was easier than with it.

32
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,440
we didn't event so we had to do
something about that so locks job is to

33
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,560
deny authorized access and it was doing
quite well in its job is to allow a

34
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,489
little and easily acquired so what if we
give they until up in hand turns out we

35
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:26,739
can just pop and drove in and completely
bypassed a lock this kind of a set the

36
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:34,840
theme for this device so I guess we'll
get to that done it and in but oh wow

37
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,400
looks like I brought something but you
get the idea so where do I start

38
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,099
that's something that I hear
surprisingly often my fuck we people

39
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,970
without the research that I've done
research that I intend to do and a lot

40
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:54,269
of air holes regarding ite or
application occasion security gentlemen

41
00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:00,310
and the things that I have noted so far
both from input from others finding

42
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,959
sources on the Internet in my own
personal experience in so well and my

43
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,329
job in general might not see there are
kind of three stages they're all pretty

44
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:12,480
intertwined
some people great

45
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,869
in or or less but for me I like to see
this appreciation

46
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,370
they're fun being gathering information
start with finding manuals and known

47
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,500
vulnerabilities GPL source code can do
quite well quite valuable and

48
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,100
downloading firmware especially for
these devices sometimes they will have

49
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,400
you do SSH
sometimes it will but having that

50
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,710
firmware oftentimes allows you to
extract a very similar copy of the paws

51
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:43,650
system and perform static analysis error
also for web applications but make a

52
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,250
slight now kind of go through so that is
efficient push everybody report

53
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,270
everything you do so you can go back and
trouble through that data to find

54
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,460
anything but inside and previous work is
also quite you've worked your cover that

55
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:03,900
a little bit from there usually go into
analysis active testing scanning static

56
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,299
analysis but I always come back and
continue gathering information hasn't

57
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,680
we're talking about analysis the same
thing they've got an expansion they'll

58
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,900
go through you'll find SSH or tell me I
will give yourself a shell that's the

59
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,700
memory stop that's where you go back you
gather more information go out more a

60
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,590
larger understanding of what it's
looking like

61
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:36,239
and then expand gratz s5 more hands use
those bones feet and one day thing that

62
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,090
I like to like to say to people is over
the juicy bits first juicy bits I means

63
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:47,880
suffering populous database operations
interactions its shell is anything they

64
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,360
can get you a very juicy payoff of path
if you mind in issues and it's up like

65
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,660
in or even points a surprising number of
devices have those and sometimes they

66
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,690
just forget the authorization of the
thing on those inputs and there and go

67
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,840
further
keep looking keep pushing and don't be

68
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,049
blinded by those views events because
there could be some very fun

69
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,970
functionality abilities and stuff that
doesn't immediate here

70
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:24,010
something conventionally juicy stuff
like anything overly complex as

71
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:31,150
Chancellor the developers may be neither
we can build an understanding finding

72
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,719
issues with it

73
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,070
but on that same note you could thought
be simple it's your chance they have

74
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:44,440
some oversights there an abusive
deviation from best practices all the

75
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,830
good stuff but some of it does come down
to have following their death stuff like

76
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,789
you can see that someone is if they've
implemented you know saying these guys

77
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,350
okay it just doesn't feel right here's
there's usually a reason behind that the

78
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:05,020
other I follow that feeling one that
said that that feeling usually requires

79
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:16,210
some experience and some knowledge but
experience and knowledge and so

80
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:20,590
approaching the terror station itself
this is kind of what I did but it's a

81
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,280
dig through and find all these issues
along with my colleagues entities in

82
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,369
Sheen the initial section gathering
green again flip every switch push every

83
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,410
button report everything news so you can
fall through and while doing so I

84
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,920
determined there was no excitation
functionality now for a lot of these

85
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,240
devices especially acids will have this
attention so you can just log in and at

86
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,230
some sort of show sometimes you're
sometimes not that can you do a very

87
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:51,280
good football for the rest of the
assessment in this case we didn't have

88
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,159
that also we need to find replacement I
also found that there was low EVPs work

89
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,290
on that central core
I think messenger bottle who've died for

90
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:07,180
a few months but appears to be back up
if it is up it's a great resource I

91
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,530
highly recommend going through it so
let's take now to focus on acting gases

92
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:16,888
surprise surprise that's rather
and then from there I delved into

93
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:22,979
analysis the firmware is available but
it's encrypted NASA at work has all

94
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:32,429
video gription easily pull it out
announces and the site map that has all

95
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,758
of our information in it and through
that information I found some Peugeot

96
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,979
see if you have errors that included the
location of the file an accomplice issue

97
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,339
so instead of having trouble through all
of that file system for the firmware

98
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:50,310
packages take that error CEO send this
location right in the source code they

99
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:55,709
showed there was actually crying Python
however the Pegman was pretty much the

100
00:08:55,709 --> 00:09:00,300
problem all so they ever worked with
Python before you may know that when you

101
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,069
run a Python script you'll end up with a
high C bottom we only have the icy

102
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:11,729
bodies which are created by our with
Python it's extremely easy to eat a lot

103
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,990
of that or on compiled using something
like on your class 6

104
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:21,329
we just ran that the unenviable called
source code pretty much called it yeah

105
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:25,709
okay people I was reading with the most
are being at a very real

106
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:35,189
first go to work and to exploring source
and where there was expanding shell

107
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:38,160
trying five of the moment though these
they can be able to access and their

108
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,040
foothold and stand our scope so we get
the bottom line making did you find

109
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:53,069
abilities go to Ruby so one of the first
ones that hang out there was see become

110
00:09:53,069 --> 00:10:00,389
18 1 2 3 2 4 which means nothing
it's alibi that's so what kind of

111
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:04,829
prompted this was that the Jason Martin
see it get handles all station across

112
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:13,469
the entire devices one end one and that
API uses a signatory my security IDs and

113
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,889
it was a lot of things such as
performing actions that are our admin

114
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:23,310
privileges I looked into that it won't
let me see Sir

115
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:31,008
that'd be providing again I do not like
this it to go away

116
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:38,008
that's where buffalo is an urgency to
payment so in this file

117
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:43,740
I'm almost immediately like this is the
first two definitions in the viola there

118
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:55,680
is something rather interesting see skip
off okay get out your word or consumer

119
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,170
so it seems that see bought that upscale
office and find somewhere but not here

120
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:08,748
so we just search through the bottom you
know in didn't / oh there's fun segment

121
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:15,329
where we see that it seems that they're
using the HTTP POST environment variable

122
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:23,279
and that's mumbles then it's obviously
wrong now if you're familiar with issue

123
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:32,129
be headers you might know this
interesting no so if you think about

124
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:36,449
this from you know the developers point
of view it makes a needs the interactive

125
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:48,300
was only having some form or another and
all commutative him but does this so he

126
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,329
just built the whitelist over us so I
series means that the host header is all

127
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:59,540
these logos in a little of us and
snapper below what was in mine request

128
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:05,839
so host entered equal blows
means it the whole of us straightforward

129
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:14,449
way truth yeah job done
did he go the wholesalers mind control

130
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:21,030
so the host hair is all these locals
even though it's never love

131
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:30,829
hey mom so those services so the posters
means I was said with locals does that

132
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:40,350
mean and but I think causes this
misconception is the idea that that

133
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:45,330
boasts hazard for is used for some sort
of profit in both bounces this is

134
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,570
actually correct that was said there is
used to determine where that was nice to

135
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,770
go tree but in any other situation
that's not quite true

136
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,910
so hope centers of the application there
I'll be around the decisions are made by

137
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:01,680
the way down the member but networking
there so at most ever is maybe note nor

138
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,900
any of us where that bus - no no it's
server the server to do something with

139
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:20,100
it so you have issues like this where
you can just change so we have normal

140
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,930
repetitive we're trying to reboot system
we have a jump SID and it says that our

141
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:31,680
session is without truly over that's
legible so from here I figured you know

142
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:38,339
just replace posts with Lobos we still
get merit which is disheartening but

143
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:44,160
it's a good in itself you see the air is
rather different coming out before it

144
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,990
says that the parameters are invalid and
that reboot I was given wandering

145
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:56,520
crackers doing parameters we gave it was
secured ID so remove the security at

146
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,689
needs as the result was double then the
Masters have make some meat Moses and

147
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:06,839
they're not fish is a carp not a good
signing group and we're using the Vice

148
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:15,810
but for us a pre great so here we are
the Jason our PC eight guys gets all

149
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:23,939
objects everybody HTTP POST editor is
logos so it was there I can prove I'm a

150
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:29,120
good source for any news this
those headers were close to getting sick

151
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:37,399
parameters fire it off and prove your
app but memorize that there's no mistake

152
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,080
no shells yet
what's the fun in that we have them out

153
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:50,300
with some English out onto the next part
I was CBD 2018 one three degrees in one

154
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:56,930
just expose in two methods in a red
little Frank so you get a body this word

155
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:02,120
strange though digging through that
looking for those juiciness and any

156
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,290
danger I think the command line order
hurt there were lavas and let's pay

157
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:11,990
attention everywhere and every license
or I'm gonna feel that pretty was

158
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:20,180
something for me minutes so NZ guy there
was no distinction from nature - 4

159
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:25,279
methods really snotty way that you've
always seen on occasion they're looking

160
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:31,730
face studies at once there were no
decorators five occasion I just didn't

161
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,209
sit right
I didn't know a lot but it is something

162
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:43,790
that I want to investigate so I did not
about me to do throw in or Olivia she's

163
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:51,730
not a baby the same type of model fourth
server it has this massive terrible loop

164
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:58,339
essentially locusts in any function that
module that's hollow is not premix

165
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:04,160
monogamous or out of spare comment at
all of your kind of local bumpkins with

166
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,560
a understory victim of your public
functions is an opportunity just like

167
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,959
that bit further decide you know it is
of the functions you need they've a

168
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,750
nine-point makes loading a Cayenne point
super easy but potentially a little too

169
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,100
easy
see the thing about Python said happens

170
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:31,100
the importance in one of the songs this
article I said was it doesn't several

171
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,320
others were bought it is intolerable
so that

172
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:43,279
you have what we import from us
sar anything that's called an LS it is

173
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:49,100
not because of others or becomes a down
in point a lot of dangerous State at

174
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:55,640
once
sadly there was sorry however some

175
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:03,740
models particular therapy bottles it in
word everything from cognitive in this

176
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:11,089
case is WTFs hi I don't remember what it
was but it's some modulus we've done

177
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:17,389
twice or some sort of back functionality
all carefully comp you do anything there

178
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:23,089
as an end point so let's dig into that
so we have to work with so how beautiful

179
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:29,530
exposes read comp and write common these
are designed for interacting shell style

180
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,710
convinced essentially just key equals
value

181
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,470
I don't know when it's outside that's a
new source code so both of these

182
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:46,010
endpoints and nobody can get WTFs or
both of these become n monks living TMS

183
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:51,230
because of important so this what
happens if great pomp can pretty much

184
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:55,120
write arbitrary shell scripts anyone
replace

185
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,649
sadly they're not executed so can just
drop one of these shell spirits in in it

186
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:06,530
and then get shot whatever there is up
we can overwrite things but most of

187
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:12,379
those aren't going to be a shell except
for perhaps of trauma if you're not

188
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,070
familiar with prom it's this wonderful
little utility that allows you to

189
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:22,669
schedule commands something that can run
every day every hour on certain hours of

190
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:28,460
certain weeks and sort of fun stuff I
can also run on every minute to be quite

191
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,210
nice for shell
let me have something like this where we

192
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:40,150
just use our our old off bypass exploit
we just tell WPI best are a comma to

193
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,900
modify routes from death take the
original Quran down

194
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,970
just sticking this new one that executes
element D with the snare on

195
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:54,970
48:33 with a new shell within - so it
has a lot of location just start that

196
00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:03,280
every minute and it just says dude whoa
case seven with prong it's not going to

197
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,750
automatically free vote that part I
usually get a gift to sync up it I could

198
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,309
be wrong but let you know that it will
not just reload that bottle there's your

199
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:18,100
gluten thing we should do that is we
bypass the king but anyway so just

200
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,000
reboot the system and make some fun
beeps turns off Amazon and then it

201
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,690
starts flying shall ever enact just so
happens to walk in it's about a gigabyte

202
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:38,980
so they run there a Pettis overkill
everything on the net because it

203
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:50,500
catalytic functions a little too
overzealous but really struck home

204
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:59,500
this device sir the TLDR the endpoints
in modulus e needs to define any

205
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,910
function which functions prefix if
another store or normally in terminal

206
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,130
just load Annie Hall go let's not do
this

207
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:11,320
so a function in defining the module
happy daily ones from exit with star the

208
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:19,470
DFS imports everything from detail bring
calm any work whatever we like yeah

209
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:24,460
there you go
but what struck home kind of the

210
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,929
terribleness of this device and just I
became gentleman was the disclosure

211
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:37,780
timeline these are usually plenty try
this one what most part is we try to try

212
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:42,220
to contact them regularly send emails to
multiple locations

213
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:48,200
eventually we sent them the balls
multiple revisions of the CV is multiple

214
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:54,110
locations still are nothing
so we announced a public livestream

215
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,300
demoing long abilities as we release
them

216
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:20,990
I did my demo livestream and be really
certain abilities respond so I guess

217
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,850
they effectively briefly the link to 700
days and then thought it's not something

218
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:30,439
I expected to happen
but having pre confused birth weeks I

219
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,310
guess eventually they realized that was
a terrible thing to do intervene through

220
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:41,270
the idea one that happen but they
deleted the they realized something was

221
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,720
terribly wrong
so of course all of the Volvo v70 fix

222
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:53,240
part is over
and work on the B hat by attackers I'm

223
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,590
not really sure why they haven't fixed
anything but they have they think they

224
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,720
have to have known - something's wrong
VW degree it's been almost eight years

225
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:09,440
since we initially tried to contact them
a lot of checking availability last week

226
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,530
I decided to download some our Mars that
they have so remember I said the model

227
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:20,149
number doesn't really matter if it's a
terror station you can probably get

228
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:24,890
written is still including the like
17-grand ones that are their flagship

229
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:30,650
Moulton enterprises but that's our team
except it's not moving I'm Fatima oh

230
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:40,000
well done so they said it was yeah so
that was a that was quite the trip and

231
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,800
that's about all I have today probably
wait that's Avengers but such as it is I

232
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,820
think that gives us a lot of time for
some questions so if you having knows

233
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,669
the time
they have all my resources with me so if

234
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:03,680
you want to poke anything diversity or
anything other device as a time

235
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,279
it's not gonna take

236
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:14,290
you
