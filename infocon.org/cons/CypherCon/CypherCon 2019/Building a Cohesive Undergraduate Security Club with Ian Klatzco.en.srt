1
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:29,000
So I want to pose a question and that is, 
who is the queen of cyber? To give you

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,500
some hints, here are a couple of our
favorite of wrong answers from the

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,070
beginning of the year. These were
submitted by undergraduates from our security

4
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:47,239
club. Does anyone have any ideas, feel
free to shout em' out. So h,i my name is

5
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:50,510
Ian Klatzco, I'm an undergrad Computer
Engineering at the University of

6
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,890
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. So I'm
really all about being nice to people and

7
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:00,140
building organizations. So I spent most
of the last year working on building up to

8
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,129
plus University. One of those are the DDR
Club and the other one is the

9
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,360
undergraduate security Club, whose name
is statement. Here's a longer list of a

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,820
couple of other things that I'm
interested in, in particular I want to

11
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,940
point out that last summer I worked on a
fuzzer. It's a

12
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,990
open-source, cross-platform it's called Killer Beez. And at the end of this year

13
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,750
I'm going to be going to Japan for about
three months. So if you've got suggestions

14
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:27,080
for places to go in Japan, or cool people to meet, I'd love to have them. So I'm here on behalf of and with a large

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,030
contingent from SIGPwny. Which utilizes
undergraduate security club. The SIG

16
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,830
stands for special interest group and
Pwny is a pun on pony and also pwning,

17
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,929
hence the whole unicorn. This logo was
actually made on really short notice by

18
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,220
one of our members whose name is Daniel. So we're from U of I which is

19
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,939
approximately three and a half hours
south of Milwaukee and we drove up here

20
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:54,830
last night with a group of about 10
people. And I think from the University

21
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,850
there's about 20 people total, including
loss. So we're advised by three

22
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,020
professors. These are the people that we
go to whenever we get into trouble and

23
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,350
we need help getting out some issue.
Whether that be with the University

24
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:12,260
I.T. It doesn't happen too often, but
there were a few incidents this year.

25
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,620
And people who we go to for general
advice or how to run the club. So if we

26
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,760
have some issue with, we don't know how
to handle this situation with

27
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:27,890
bureaucracy, or with financing, they help us out. So it's pretty well known that getting knowledge

28
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,510
into security is really hard. And
this is kind of a subset of a larger

29
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,599
problem, which is that getting people into
technical things, or learning about

30
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,179
technical things is a really challenging
thing to do. So, why is that the case?

31
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,769
Well, security itself is a really
difficult field. There, it's fast-moving,

32
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:50,599
you constantly have to keep up to date under the research. You have to study a lot for a

33
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:54,950
long period of time by candle light
basically. Let the computer monitor add

34
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,510
to the mood I guess. With along with the
computer in order to pick up all this

35
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,548
sort of esoteric skills for a really
wide set. There's a lot of

36
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:07,670
other interesting things in life too. And
that's especially true on a university

37
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:14,540
campus when there's lots of different
clubs so beyond that there's not a huge

38
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,608
amount of learning resources if you want
to pick up something you need to go and

39
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:22,970
find those resources yourself which can
be a challenge in and of itself and

40
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:28,160
they're really difficult to make as well
if you swap a code so we've got kind of

41
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,150
our problems days which is that teaching
people security is a really challenging

42
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,560
thing to do so why do they care about
them well it's also really important

43
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,410
there's a lot of jobs and security and
the concepts are really broadly

44
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:44,060
applicable so if you're an individual
who may not necessarily care very much

45
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:49,010
the concept of a threat model or
allocator currently based on how much

46
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,940
you're concerned about something is
really broadly applicable and then

47
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,090
password managers are 200 days and
others that works really well for a

48
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,569
broad number of people beyond that a lot
of people are really drawn to security

49
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:05,810
because it's a cool field and if you can
capitalize on matter

50
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,819
split so to speak then you can help a
lot of people learn more about it so

51
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:15,890
that gives us our motivation for why do
we care about this problem so the

52
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,519
responsible industry in the security
community it's time to make seeds yet

53
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,770
and this rather whole thing is basically
said ok let's take a bunch of challenges

54
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,430
that teach some small nugget of security
information handle into the game or find

55
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,400
them so let's give people different
levels and let's give them a strong

56
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,810
incentive to do them and this works
pretty well

57
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,690
you typically log into the website that
looks like this one it has a question of

58
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,820
challenges you select a challenge which
is valid this short district actual

59
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,669
description of what's going on and it's
a little bit of a pig it'll have

60
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:54,830
something like a net cat like NC and
username at an IP which to an untrained

61
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,789
eye it looks like a bunch of taxes and
numbers and at times and without a new

62
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,810
context this doesn't make any sense so
if you manage to get far enough then

63
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,870
you'll realize that oh there are these
challenges which is kind of like

64
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,380
amorphous concept that's not super well
defined and that you're looking for

65
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,159
flats and if you get flags when building
a place I want to point out that it's a

66
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,729
bunny we don't refer to them as points
we refer to them as 20 points they need

67
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:22,669
to be delivered with exactly that
reflection to so we've tried gamifying

68
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:28,609
this problem of learning hard things but
it's still really challenging it's

69
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,570
really lonely exercise and that a lot of
CTF challenges can solve solo and then

70
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,349
you won't actually take too much away
other than what you can do yourself and

71
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,850
this can be really deep motivating
people so let's go back to city pub so

72
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:47,720
sick money is a clock it's a group of
young people if you look at schools like

73
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,610
RPI or C mu sigma doesn't really hold a
candle to there are really poor

74
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,250
accomplishments they regularly send a
lot of people to death

75
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,450
they'll place the top CD of leaderboards
they have really cool research output

76
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,380
these spin-off confidence that are do
cool things like we need artists cyber

77
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,790
Grand Challenge certainly speaking the
company after how much they'll publish

78
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,560
entire classes that are dedicated to
binary exploitation and just showing up

79
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,370
on github for anyone to do this is a
really cool stuff the suit coming had

80
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,970
some we'd like individual projects that
were impressive but nothing that really

81
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:27,330
wasn't being happened so I was talking
with Paul who is another senior from our

82
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:33,390
school and and I went out after our last
meeting where we traditionally of watch

83
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,469
hackers together now for people change
that meeting Toth and Paul and I were

84
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,980
not getting food and we were talking to
each other but hey why aren't there more

85
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,540
people do why not more people drawn to
come and work together and fight

86
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,590
together you know it seems like sitcom
is not that good

87
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:55,679
and I want it to be good so that
naturally leads to the question of how

88
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:03,020
can you make it better so that then
becomes our big question for the year

89
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:09,990
okay so we've concluded that the core
team of soup Konya was be BTU and that

90
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,440
if the meetings weren't good then the
club wasn't good and the meetings

91
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,900
weren't good they were not fun they were
really long like they need 90 minutes a

92
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,780
one-person would talk alone without any
actual leg

93
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,770
interaction with people and then you'd
be kind of thrown off the deep-end to go

94
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,570
and try and solve challenges and this is
a way for some people to want to

95
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,890
security in particular if you have this
in context it's relatively easy but

96
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:42,500
outside of that newcomers have a really
hard time like this and so if we want to

97
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,710
make sick money meeting this better we
need to make it easier to learn and the

98
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,890
flip side of this is that we need to
make it we need to get better at

99
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:54,860
teaching okay so that's our answer
we know that teaching security is

100
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,480
hardened we have this basic unit of a
meeting we need to focus on teaching

101
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,040
better meetings so that's so that's an
easy review all right teaching this sort

102
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,070
of education suit is this thing that's
not super challenging or technically

103
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,360
difficult right that's why you know if I
want to teach bunch of freshmen how to

104
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,630
install Linux for the first time I give
them a couple of shell commands and

105
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,810
they're off finding zero days in
software and winning significance right

106
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:27,020
yeah that's not that easy and this is a
kind of really given my 15 years of

107
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,169
education that I'm about to finish
really gives me a newfound appreciation

108
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:37,159
for my teachers it's not quite as simple
so you might ask why I waited until I

109
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,729
was about to finish college they or they
try any of this well when I came into

110
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:45,440
college I didn't know anything about
security and so I needed to build from

111
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,830
the ground up a lot of the basic
concepts and then once I had picked up a

112
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,290
certain amount of prep this way to go
forth and teach things to younger people

113
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,349
the other thing is that signaling didn't
have a good way for young people to

114
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,530
contribute and this was kind of a shame
because I had this interview that I

115
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:04,850
wanted to learn I didn't know what I was
doing but I didn't have a place where I

116
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,080
could sort of push this that was
well-defined and actually create some

117
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,580
galleries in the club so we created a
list of things that we wanted meetings

118
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,750
to be which the I think the important
one here is drop you didn't want to

119
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,230
shake people for not being able to make
and so we made each one a standalone

120
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,890
completely self-contained things that
only require concepts from that one user

121
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:33,740
and this allows newcomers to still be
able to learn a lot regardless of

122
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,850
whether they'd be able to make all the
meetings throughout the entire youth

123
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,210
beyond that invention learning in Nasik
puppies

124
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:46,460
so we came up with these questions and
these are sort of the big three things

125
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,360
we thought would lead us to be better at
teaching in particular that's how we

126
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,170
make them come back how do we make it
less work to generate all this and then

127
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:58,699
how do we actually measure our success
so the basic structure of a week for us

128
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,980
is that on at the beginning of the week
I will message some unlucky underclass

129
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,420
and say hey you're responsible for
teaching convening this week or it's

130
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:15,740
often a which really and then Tuesday or
Wednesday we'll meet in person or

131
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,630
remotely collaborating you know be some
online tool and we'll flush out the

132
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,590
basic flow of the challenges so we'll
make a bunch of really easy ones that

133
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,700
are targeted at people are like hey I
don't know what a 64 is if I don't know

134
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,020
what x86 is move instruction goes and so
these very simple challenges will just

135
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,250
try to teach the extreme primitives and
then from there we have a medium and on

136
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,030
our challenge which kind of wind up to
being like CTF a hundred two hundred

137
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,810
pointers which is to say something you
would recently saw all the like thirty

138
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:51,020
minutes if you have experience and a lot
less a lot more time if you don't and so

139
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,100
will present to all these things and the
person responsible for preparing communi

140
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,390
muscle
your presentation and then people would

141
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,130
go and I'll actually solve them so then
hopefully this means that Thursday will

142
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,920
teach the meeting that people will do
the challenges and if they have a spare

143
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,329
time then we'll go and do it on the
weekend as well this is the ideal of

144
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,200
things but actually typically happening
is that right before 7:00 on Thursday

145
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,430
will quickly crank out a new meeting
ends up working for you people take a

146
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,120
lot away and they learn from it learn
from it so we choose something that we

147
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,200
don't see don't be upset ways to measure
that so let's walk through the actual

148
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,810
structure of what we do every week we
came up with a couple of things that

149
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,869
worked really well for us that we think
are positive like the whole it might be

150
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:42,089
useful in other permutations these the
first one is be in attendance live which

151
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:47,520
helps us solve a problem let's get
people coming back to the club and what

152
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,230
this is is at the very beginning of a
meeting I'll walk up to the board and

153
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,920
all right a flag or coming that's worth
a reasonable number of points like

154
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,329
typically about half the sum total of
what you think if you solved everything

155
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:04,110
yeah I actually implemented this out
kind of a head reason the person at the

156
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,880
top of the leader board was never coming
to meetings but still held the top spot

157
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,960
leader boards this baby really unhappy
because I want the club to be like the

158
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,070
teeth right if you never come in person
you can't do it too so I started making

159
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,760
these relatively higher point value
attendance flags so that not only would

160
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:26,640
people be incentivized to come up you
fall off the top so at the very

161
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:33,990
beginning of a meeting will actually go
and show people why they're here so what

162
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,500
this means that we'll go to our sick
Pony to see cat website and we'll login

163
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,860
I don't know where my

164
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,330
the sense of being particularly useful
for the cops because they see exactly

165
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:59,430
what the point is of coming right away
and show them all hey you can go and you

166
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,310
can click on challenge and the reason
why we're here is to keep challenges and

167
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,569
that's the you know

168
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,330
and so this simple act of showing them
exactly what they need to do before the

169
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:22,010
beginning of every meeting it works
really well if maybe soon we get why

170
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:28,660
they're there and so this does think for
us in terms of being able to actually

171
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:35,050
you know it's this is really useful for
us in terms of helping newcomers

172
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:44,240
understand we're so tight and that was
that we could look at the list of songs

173
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,329
for a given week and we get a nice list
for everything this is kind of cool

174
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:54,019
because then it gives us a gap so we can
measure when you people come with us

175
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:56,810
when our people leave together
you'll notice that there's a whole bunch

176
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,050
of lows whether we have midterm week if
there's a whole bunch of Hadas

177
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,319
predictively first meeting when all the
freshmen come for the first time and

178
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,630
whenever we have an external speaker
coming particularly headed to this first

179
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:16,100
one was Thomas project who's a security
professional founded which was later

180
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:21,079
bought by entity group and so he has
kind of a similar idea of play learning

181
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:25,399
by doing and was really happy to come
and teach a meeting for us that was all

182
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:30,709
performance so he focused on a again
attacks on a DES and DC realization of

183
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:34,670
attacks on web applications and then
we've also ran an event with Northrop

184
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:39,649
Grumman which is kind of great excuse to
make a flyover Comic Sans holiday

185
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:43,610
hackathon that you actually do have
which is a tagline that I really like I

186
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,529
hope to use in the future so this is
nice because we got to be together in a

187
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:51,040
room
they pizza to solve a couple basic

188
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,439
reversing challenges so we focused on
making sure that we got through all

189
00:14:55,439 --> 00:15:02,620
personalities so let's move up to the
next meeting feature which is that we

190
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,569
came up with a strict format
we'd have 15 minutes to speak and 45

191
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:13,420
minutes to help people solve challenges
and this is to fight the boredom that

192
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:19,870
Simoni kind of created initially it's a
necessary component of security to learn

193
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,930
by doing you can't just read about
things and books you have to actually

194
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:31,329
apply your skills and we then made our
meetings reflect this so this also kind

195
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:35,439
of solves our issue that we need to get
people coming back because then they're

196
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:44,019
able to they have a consistent like they
actually are doing things and learning

197
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:46,540
things they're more like didn't come
back and the thing that we noticed here

198
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,129
is that just by walking around and be
friendly you're a lot more likely to

199
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:55,480
have people coming back and that's kind
of a powerful thing I really like Julia

200
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,240
Evans who was this cool person who works
right and she has kind of this general

201
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,559
aesthetic of hey let's learn things
together as opposed to focusing on who's

202
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:09,519
right or who's the best and this goes a
really long way for helping newcomers

203
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,439
actually say when you retain Congress
than their club can grow so if I want to

204
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:18,160
revisit this question of who is the
queen of cycler okay but now I want to

205
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,209
do it a little bit more in the format
obvious economy so like here's the

206
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:26,109
challenge description it just has a link
to this Twitter account and I want to

207
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,850
encourage all of you to go ahead and
open up this Twitter account and try to

208
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:35,050
find the answer to this question I'll
give you a small hint we run a CTF every

209
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:40,540
year it's a it's a polynomial university
if you're just search for this you might

210
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,639
find some interesting things on this
Twitter account so we're gonna take a

211
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,639
small break and go ahead and do that our
Sigma numbers are actually gonna walk

212
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,110
around help
this the format of our meeting typically

213
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,330
so um feel free enough that make some
difference if you wear has nicer syntax

214
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,690
it's up quite Gmail like so if you go
searching for from this particular

215
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:05,250
Twitter account with the name of our CTF
will find this tweet which is apply what

216
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:12,300
we use for one of our public CTN
competitions okay so what do we learn

217
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,589
from this particular kind of a meeting
format well it's like if we kind of

218
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:21,569
really aggressively push people towards
the answer if we help by giving them all

219
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:25,170
the parts and giving a lot of support
and they're a lot more likely to learn

220
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:29,730
things especially if they're you know
because this field is so intimidating

221
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:36,320
it's really useful to help new people
learn things and keep coming back so

222
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,600
let's move on to the next one we started
a like a full-time an internal CTF with

223
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,439
a live feedback component that I think
is really cool so this was a little bit

224
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,330
of an accident um we had technical
instance of C T FD for our very first

225
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:59,340
meeting and then we left it up so this
wasn't super Intendant I kept paying the

226
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,939
server bills but was the case that we
needed a meeting for the following week

227
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,690
it sounds like oh okay I'll just up with
some more challenges to the CTF to you

228
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,970
you just kept using it because people
text all the things so on top of that we

229
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:17,130
added a very social component to it this
court is slack but basically markets

230
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,270
itself has or gamers it's really useful
for a lot of things and sneakily it has

231
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:26,010
a web more functionality just like slack
does and so we've worked C T FD and we

232
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:30,240
added read books to it such that every
single time that somebody solves a

233
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,330
challenge that'll get posted directly in
a one of these hats and so this is

234
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:42,210
really cool because if you are working
late and trying to solve a really hard

235
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,380
challenge and then you finally get it at
3 a.m. it's no longer lonely or deal of

236
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,980
oh I got the flag and I moved up a spot
on the leaderboard it's a little bit

237
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,649
cool
because now your friends doing a nice

238
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:56,399
job I wrote that challenge you just
solved it what you learned or even

239
00:18:56,399 --> 00:19:00,478
cooler how did you solve it or they
could be like oh you stole my son oh

240
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:06,299
you're bored I'm gonna take that back
tomorrow and so this happens a lot but

241
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:10,049
the cool thing is that it's a lot more
of a friendly sort of leaderboard

242
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:14,719
hopping this was implemented by one of
our students whose name is James and

243
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:19,649
this is probably the single best time
that we've done in terms of making the

244
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:24,089
experience of Sione more social and more
friendly and more enjoyable for people

245
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:30,658
this really does a lot okay so let's go
to the last thing of opportunity to come

246
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:35,820
we decided to document a lot of things
so sick ponies seniors graduate and

247
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,779
active like academic clubs have a lot of
turns so we wanted to have some way of a

248
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,619
cohesive Club identity and this goes
back to our Pony question of how do we

249
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:48,988
create less work for us in the future so
we're investing all those effort if we

250
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:52,349
make some documentation for how to do
things then a little expedite the

251
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:56,849
process and into the future so for
example we have us an intersect on our

252
00:19:56,849 --> 00:20:00,210
we can demonstrate okay this is the
formula we fell over for making a

253
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,690
meeting and once you if you follow all
these steps then you'll be able to

254
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:09,779
pretty quickly make something that can
be reused in the future and so that's

255
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:14,009
where Canada meetings comes in Canada in
your box and their packaging will take

256
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:19,229
all sort of we had this issue where we
would constantly recreate meetings every

257
00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:24,839
year and this was a lot of wasted effort
but then we thought hey what are the

258
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:27,530
actual work
things that you need to reproduce and

259
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:32,030
we'd settled on sort of these breathe
and so that if we can just make that in

260
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,889
a nice small format that we can really
easily reuse this in a future

261
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:41,600
so there's another useful aspect here I
have this thing I like to call minion

262
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,949
recruitment which is where students can
get actually in the University credits

263
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,670
or doing research projects and
professors this is the benefit of being

264
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:53,180
on really good terms and having a good
working relationship with professors is

265
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:59,360
that we can sign up all the freshmen so
that they get a grade for six points and

266
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,560
this is really useful because now they
have a bigger stake and to actually

267
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,820
doing things I'm coming back I get to do
things like hey can you do this unit of

268
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,960
work and then if they don't do the unit
of work that they don't get it great so

269
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,760
they've got strong incentives keep doing
signals this also kind of cells of our

270
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,240
earlier problem policy really have up
into fine structure for young wants to

271
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,160
contribute but now with this if there's
a very clear path with oh I want to do

272
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,310
something cool I want to learn about
this topic how can I do it either way

273
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:34,399
that's more fun and more social so we
created like basically reduce same deal

274
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,710
documentation to flocks of these
meetings and a text format that's based

275
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,280
on the animal that just beats right up
to our blog format so all a student has

276
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,190
to do is update this text file with some
information according to so you know

277
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,390
this small how to how to do list
and then it will read they're really

278
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,840
nice to have a website and just give
them okay as a person writing the

279
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,750
meeting this is what me and there's
email or just send this out and we put

280
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:04,130
this all on our website so if you're
interested you know if you were

281
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,880
affiliated with running any sort of
security education internships and you

282
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,470
need a presentation on short notice
you can totally feel free to grab them

283
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,770
from our site they're designed to be
reused and we be really happy to see

284
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,190
other people getting value for work I
also want a shout out a program called

285
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,690
hacks which is run by the Fair Work For
Less our rim

286
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,070
this is sort of the same idea where your
university is like we'll team up into

287
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,990
this program and that someone will be
responsible for making a challenge every

288
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,680
month or so and then they'll share it
amongst all the universities and so this

289
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,410
reduces a lot of the workload of
actually designing challenges because

290
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:42,850
that's really apartment so I've got a
small disclaimer we do reuse a lot of

291
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:49,419
existing things like CTF sorry are often
running this helps cut back on the words

292
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,690
a lot trying to attribute this as much
as possible and then the actual value

293
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,710
that we create is in the presentations
that we give and then walking around and

294
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,270
helping people solve this ok so we went
over these cool things that we did to

295
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:06,760
make our meetings better and we went
over all these you know ways to keep

296
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,300
people coming back and learning more
things and doing less work so how do we

297
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,889
actually measure our success use so
here's this current status the leader or

298
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,730
does it last week these are the top 10
players you'll notice that some people

299
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,930
came away and mid January really big
March it still managed to climb into the

300
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:28,000
top 10 relatively quickly I want to also
congratulate three people repeating to

301
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,210
the most meetings because I think this
is an important metric as well this is

302
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,990
one of those useful side-effects to
collective lieutenants why these Thomas

303
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,800
and Jesse are both here today so they're
really friendly and well one of them is

304
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:44,560
really friendly and so uh please talk to
them and get to know them because

305
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:49,030
they're really cool people so here's a
zoomed in view of one week of our CTF

306
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,940
you'll notice that here's Thursday at 7
p.m. which is our traditional game time

307
00:23:53,940 --> 00:24:02,830
but this is Friday night and this is
Sunday and Monday Tuesday Monday Tuesday

308
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:09,210
and Wednesday so this made me really
happy because this was an example of oh

309
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:14,890
people are actually working on things on
their own time and that was kind of the

310
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,280
whole point of putting all this effort
into making better meetings so that

311
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,170
people would get into this and they
would walk to work

312
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,950
the other cool thing is that you'll
notice that

313
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,850
we'll stay after the one hour of the
beating which meant that they actually

314
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:32,540
wanted to solve it promise and that was
another thing that they knew happy a

315
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,810
side effect of collecting attendance
data is that we get an average number of

316
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:40,460
people over the course of the year so
fact your prior it would get to people

317
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,640
asking the semester it would be mean
three other people it's just you know

318
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,350
people who are really really dedicated
didn't get scared away but here we've

319
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:52,340
now had an average of 18 people such
that our last meeting still draws like

320
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,419
15 or 20 people all semester even when
they're spies and so I think that that's

321
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:01,190
another example hey we did a pretty good
job of making this Club way more open to

322
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:06,770
new cars and helping more talented
people get however we also had a couple

323
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:20,300
of them I like to say Lucy Lucy's there
today might tell me what this is you'll

324
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,750
notice in particular that I think this
is cool is that it says greedy and if

325
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,840
you look on a gritty keyboard the tea
and the wire right next to each other

326
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,419
somebody's pretty clearly had type fruit
along with our IP address on one of

327
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,720
their virtual machines that we have
running a hypervisor on a university

328
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:45,290
server so we got the reasoning for this
is kind of embarrassing Kali Linux has a

329
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:50,480
default password on her account and that
password is torn and we put a VM on a

330
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,600
public internet or that indivi through
that defect

331
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,879
so as a result terrorists started
spending out Nell spam and we got angry

332
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,060
slack message from the grad students in
cloud on a lighter note this is another

333
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:10,129
moment that made me really happy
the message was exact but he is a

334
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,960
freshman who's generally interested in
weapons and so if he was like hey it'd

335
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,290
be cool to teach immediately kind of cuz
we talked about it finding the next one

336
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,659
who encourage people to do it can I do
it

337
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:27,330
semester from now where I feel
comfortable and about six hours later he

338
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:31,169
sent me this message where he had
completely finished all the slides and

339
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:34,350
all the chocolates heard of me not shown
here is a whole bunch of back and forth

340
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,949
I'm like hey yeah this is like what a
cookie is right this is like how you

341
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:43,560
into traffic but I don't think it's
really cool that we had a fresh nothing

342
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,270
like was doing this and then really
quickly turn around to it okay I did it

343
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:55,200
and then he talked to me so we have our
original problem which is that getting

344
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,460
new people to security is a really
challenging thing to do and we have our

345
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,480
original answer which is that we need to
get better it turns out this isn't

346
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,100
really where we came up with these
really cool with ways to improve our

347
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:14,189
meetings we came up with a couple of
other questions to this or figure out

348
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:20,040
okay how are we doing what are we doing
it is it actually working that leaves

349
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,280
that one day on the graphic though and
that starts accounting studies so he's

350
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,030
got you what we have experienced doing
them a particular subset of security and

351
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,940
they want to work on projects that
directly interesting to them they're

352
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:36,330
going to be a little bit or by the
regular weekly meanness and we wanted to

353
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:41,100
make that okay so we have our senior
members kind of walk around and help

354
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,010
people out which is one thing that kind
of Browns Levin keeps them a few minutes

355
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:49,170
and at the same time we'll meet
separately in separate other groups

356
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:53,760
which is our fantastic bug bounty so
pentesting is like this very alluring

357
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,180
phrase that they're also a lot of people
and so one of our seniors was working

358
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,290
for a consulting firm and said oh you
know I know a little bit about this

359
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:05,670
let's do a separate group that
explicitly does this and so much people

360
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:09,330
met every week of the first semester and
then tried to do at testing offensive

361
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,780
things and then we did a separate bug
bounty room so this is one where we were

362
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,110
saying okay we need to sit down for a
long period of time and

363
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:21,790
and we're trying to find bugs in
operating systems and chrome and other

364
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:25,178
random browsers and try to submit them
for bounties and actually make some

365
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:31,240
insane money both of these are like
pretty new and they're not very far

366
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,270
along Island if you're only been working
on them for about a year and is slowly

367
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:39,309
trying to figure them out more so we
don't super have a good sense of where

368
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:42,700
they'll be in terms of identity this is
where we kind of need a hand

369
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,260
so there's a whole we've got a whole
bunch of different ways in which people

370
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,070
from companies or people from other
University clubs can contribute and we'd

371
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,668
really like to see these rules or things
happening particular we can expose

372
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:59,350
people to come teach our meetings so we
can offer you a place to stay for a week

373
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,709
so if you want to drive down to
Champaign and then teach you sit on your

374
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:07,090
meeting you get to meet a bunch of
Spartan undergrads women from them then

375
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,939
we totally invited - we'd love to see
that happen

376
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,540
Tom's Datchet coming down and teaching a
meeting on deserialization

377
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,230
AES attacks it was a really successful
example of us that I was really happy

378
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:23,410
with well beyond that we need money were
the reason why we managed to send a

379
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,350
bunch of people to this conference is
that a large Silicon Valley startup gave

380
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,889
us five and this enabled a bunch of
freshmen whose parents control their

381
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:33,130
money whose parents you know comics
still like okay whatever you need

382
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:37,750
including the drank with what were you
moving from you still make their way to

383
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,120
this conference because their parents
don't have to pay for them again but

384
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,678
kind of like mommy got this right it's
all paid for it's all taken care of you

385
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:46,780
don't need to worry about any of this
and then they can go to this conference

386
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:51,760
and get to meet all of old people who
are older and say like oh yes these

387
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,830
actions but I'm not to do beyond that
you can also use cash for things like

388
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:03,639
hardware we have a service
it's Oran and we also want to run a

389
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:09,530
another CTF for recruiting purposes in
the early spring so you did want to

390
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:14,090
already with northrup-grumman or we had
two cars from an engineer's name come in

391
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:17,510
and they bought us pizza and they ran
some really basic reverser challenges

392
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:22,160
and we also noticed a kind of spike in
Independence because of us so we'd like

393
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,340
to do this again but in a slightly
larger a/c at the beginning of the fall

394
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,909
approximately the first week of
September so we'd like to see about

395
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,919
maybe like ten or so engineers from
different companies come in and sponsor

396
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,780
prizes and sponsor pizza and run our
basic meeting formats and teach people

397
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,500
were freshmen and freshman in college
and about security before for the most

398
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,299
part a lot of really basic skills and so
this carries benefited for us and now we

399
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:50,389
get to recruit a lot of people because
they're like wow this club has like a

400
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,870
lot of clout and get companies to come
in and those companies want to recruit

401
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:57,350
us and get us internships and things and
so then that's really beneficial for

402
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:02,540
companies because then they get to hire
people out of that pool on tablets it

403
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,389
would look sharp especially if they're
early and they came out to a security

404
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:10,309
flaw they're gone so we need money
expecting something to happen if you're

405
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:15,678
interested in contributing was that it
was getting touch beyond that we've got

406
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,460
so you know we've done for all these
things there's a couple a sort of short

407
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,110
summary of the important emails the
copier and the first one is that when

408
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:29,510
you make CTF more fun and more friendly
people are far more inclined to it and

409
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:34,160
this helps them learn and this helps
your organization grow and it helps

410
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,600
really just makes each have a better
place for a lot of our people working

411
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,939
with him security they get jobs they get
money everyone's happy beyond that we

412
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,169
also noticed that flipping a classroom
does a lot so this is kind of an

413
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:54,020
educational research term for learn by
doing and making Saucony follow this

414
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:58,980
format of having a lot more focused
actual working on activities helps

415
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:05,190
people learn things that come back and
lastly you want to minimize all the work

416
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:09,540
that you do so if you are spending all
this effort designing a weekly meeting

417
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:14,540
then you might as well make it reusable
in the future so that feature your

418
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,180
underclassmen who will now be about the
classroom won't have to redesign the

419
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:23,250
entire meeting but they can take the
existing one and make it better okay so

420
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:28,110
where's that as well
at the end of the day we have to teach

421
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:31,350
200 freshmen to use the command line
over the course of the semester and

422
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:38,459
that's kind of not exciting but a club
is really about a lot more than that if

423
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:43,410
we can make the environment friendly and
fun and compassionate then people will

424
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:48,120
want to come back and work together if
they want to work together they'll learn

425
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,639
the skills and all the really awesome
stuff will follow so that's kind of our

426
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,480
mission statement love we've developed
it over the past year and I hope to see

427
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,100
the carry on the future it's nice to see
people well

428
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:06,240
freshman sophomore teaching meaning for
the first time it's nice to get together

429
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,250
and like legitimately be really happy to
be hanging out and learn even up TLS at

430
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,660
1:00 in the morning on a Wednesday
I think the clothes made a lot of

431
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,950
progress over the past year and I'm
really excited to see where they'll go

432
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,250
in the future
that being said I'm graduating so I'm

433
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:28,020
looking for a job approximately you're
from now if you want to see me working

434
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,800
for your organization

435
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:45,820
you would like flashers you encourage
and share flexible so the challenges are

436
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:49,720
relatively easy it's going to be a lot
less than what you typically see it in a

437
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,919
real CTO and the idea here is that
people are new you don't want to have

438
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,090
backpackers you want to focus on good
competition which is working together

439
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:02,770
and sharing flags it's a problem because
they're small comes in is who can share

440
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:08,440
a house and so we see a lot of that
happen so how do you reach out to put

441
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:14,200
flyers up do you have a list about the
classes it's there's a weaver one

442
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,049
recruiting event that's part of the
really big CS club at the beginning of

443
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,770
the year I would just go up say hey we
hack things come learn how to hack

444
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,310
things that draws a lot of people for
the first piece after that the only

445
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,399
people we get a kind of a slow trickle
of students who's basically looking for

446
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:31,388
security and so that's maybe not the
best well because we only really have

447
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:35,859
one big event that's why we want to run
an additional recruiting event with the

448
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:46,719
support of more people so you mentioned
giving money so yeah we are I'm pretty

449
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:55,029
sure we're tax deductible so donations
should be best with my tax break right

450
00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:00,790
there I'm 22 I still need to learn how
to do my taxes it's some time of year

451
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:03,600
right into Monday

452
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:11,220
you're doing the CT up all year round
you're aggregating those points and your

453
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,118
attendance accounts for so many of those
points how do you get those new recruits

454
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,530
interested in participating say January
February March after there's already

455
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:24,240
been a lot of meetings they're super
behind it's also the jumps in there but

456
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,049
they would theoretically never be able
to catch up to you know that senior got

457
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:36,720
it to be going every meeting I don't
really have a great answer that for the

458
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,779
most part so it depends on what
motivates an individual person the

459
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,420
people who are going to start coming
later in the year are going to keep

460
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,890
coming really consistent Thomas right
here didn't come until maybe two or

461
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:56,730
three months into the first semester and
he's so the other things that we have

462
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,660
ways like writing a meeting gives you a
lot of points and that's part of how

463
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,080
Thomas made up having to missed all
those meetings so if you designed one

464
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,119
which not everyone does and that pops
them up really high with you know also

465
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,310
be escalate points luck so I the
starting meetings are 500 points I'm

466
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:20,190
winning last week was for house oh yeah
that was more that we didn't have a

467
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:27,599
cohesive way of assigning points it's
not that important the point the reason

468
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,520
isn't the point value ultimately the
whole point is to motivate people into

469
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:38,550
doing things and so whatever serves that
is the best thing that we can do so

470
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:41,910
people typically don't care necessarily
about being at the top and if they do

471
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,950
they'll find other ways to do it like
constant

472
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:57,630
yeah thanks coming but I've got some of
these like these slides and other

473
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:02,070
resources are up at seek money calm if
you want to use them in any of our

474
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,420
meetings or submit meetings to us we'd
really appreciate it because it'd be

475
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,820
great to see people getting value out of
the work that we

476
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:15,200
you
