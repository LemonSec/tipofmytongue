1
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:28,040
It's a pleasure to be here.
What's my accent? Anyone knows? What, what

2
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,669
is my accent? Where are from? Where am I
from?

3
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:39,080
Any guesses? Okay Israel, all right. And
enjoys I am Israeli. And in fashion I

4
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,739
want to start with a direct question. So
if you know of Israelis that's part of

5
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:50,959
what we do, often. Who is this guy?
Anyone knows? I have one per person. Yes.

6
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay. This is Kevin Finster. He's
instilled and respected security

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,630
researcher. And he found the one
thing that, according to reports, leaked

8
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:09,050
personal information of DJI consumers,
according to the media reports. And at

9
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:17,270
time when Kevin has done this research,
DJI in fact had an active bug bounty. They just

10
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,030
launched a bounty and Kevin, although he
has you know, lots of hair. As you can see.

11
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,750
He wanted to do the right thing, he waned
to wear the white hat. He wanted to report

12
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:34,460
this vulnerability under this new, just
launched DJI bug bounty. Now, the way this

13
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,259
bug bounty was launched at the time,
according to the reports, as you can see,

14
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:45,380
was in this kind of fashion. There wasn't
really a clear policy, with a clear scope.

15
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,600
It wasn't a bug bounty kind of
policy you are used to seeing, you know.

16
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,048
Contract with the elements. It was more
of a PR announcement along this lines.

17
00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:01,740
So, because there was some unclarity
according to reports, expected scope, Kevin

18
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:09,179
contacted DJI. And he asked them is this vulnerability in scope? And they said

19
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,480
according to the reports, it is in fact in scope.

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,090
And you're authorized to conduct
this testing.

21
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,959
Now we got the active ability. They
offered him a thirty thousand dollar

22
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,310
reward for that vulnerability. So I don't know if we have bug hunters today in the room with

23
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,980
us? But, thirty thousand dollars throwback is pretty high. That's a pretty high back.

24
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:39,060
That's my priority back and then the
plot thickens. DJI also wanted, according

25
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,100
to media reports, Kevin to sign an
agreement. An agreement that he found was

26
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,239
one-sided.
One that lets him legally exposed. So Kevin

27
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:55,260
refused to sign this agreement, and in negotiations as far that process, a legal rep

28
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,649
drafted a letter mentioning that
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was

29
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,739
exchanged, according to the reports. Now,
this is an interesting example, because

30
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,660
this is one of the first time that we
heard about a potential legal question

31
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:16,489
going public in a bug bounty settings.
So how does this story ends? Anyone knows?

32
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:23,069
Anyone heard? Kevin ended up walking away from an improved thirty thousand

33
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:30,060
dollar bug bounty. So, refusing to sign a
contract and walking away from that

34
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,549
improved background.
And I think this is a bill you know,

35
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:37,239
there are multiple versions to the story.
This all according to reports and I

36
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,239
encourage you to go online and you know,
look at all the versions to the story

37
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,420
equally. DJI responds to this article.
But isn't this is, in fact an

38
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:52,420
interesting you know, story that just
relied on some of the emerging aspects that

39
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,170
we're seeing when it comes to the
legalese and the interactions of

40
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,668
bug bounties and one ability
disclosure programs we don't want. So

41
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:05,560
what I'm going to be sharing with you
today, is a bit about that landscape. So

42
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:12,189
just show hands anyone here is you know
with my prior work? Not at all, great. Because we

43
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:17,738
have a whole hour to dig into that. So
again, so this is mostly repair work that

44
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:22,299
I did before I joined Intel. Today my
director, I had a director global cyber

45
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,560
security policy with Intel. And also
teach at UC Berkeley, the master in

46
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,050
cybersecurity program. But I did this
work before I joined Intel as part of my

47
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:38,800
doctoral degree in the law, at UC
Berkeley law school. And part of that work

48
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,590
I really dived into a lot of contracts.
Hundreds of contracts. Both along with

49
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,460
the disclosure programs, backgrounds and
platforms and most important feedback

50
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,830
bounty programs. To inquire what is going
around in that landscape, and I'm gonna

51
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,620
be sharing a lot of that research we do
today and also going into some of

52
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,600
the transform here seen with respect to
bug bounty legalese and just you know,

53
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,030
looking at some myths that are
circling, circling around. Why is this

54
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:12,440
important? This is important because
there is a conception among the

55
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,030
information security community, among the research community, that you know, the law

56
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,799
matters here. That they're legal risks.
And you know that's the empirical

57
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,240
research. So this is one example, this is
work done by since D. Anyone here from

58
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,289
you know, the city Phoenix and democracy
technology there are doing very

59
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:34,190
important work and this type of in this
research what they did is they interview

60
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,750
twenty leading information security
professionals hackers and other

61
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,039
professionals working in this field and
they asked us specifically about the

62
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,380
laws and fifty percent than half of
those researchers said in that research

63
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,969
that they literally think about
copyright law and the CFAA and laws that

64
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,470
are going to be talking about them today
as they're doing their testing so much

65
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,979
that this is a consideration when
everything when they are thinking what

66
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:05,169
if they disclose the mobility and they
might even change the way they test

67
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:10,789
because of these because of this law
moreover we know from additional

68
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:16,190
research that was done among 100
security researchers that 20% of them so

69
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,840
this is research looking at 100 research
also from that academic center setting

70
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,520
that's 20 percent of them said they were
threatened in one kind of way legal

71
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,070
action and a broader research that was
conducted in 2015 with more than 400

72
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:38,599
researchers they found that 60% 60% 6-0
of the researchers reported that this

73
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:43,280
consideration of legal risk is something
that are thinking about when there are

74
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,239
that Junction when when they need to
decide where it reports to a cooperation

75
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:54,860
of our mobility so we know that this
conception is emerging that is existing

76
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,180
among the community and there might be
some gap between how the law operates

77
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,750
and that
reception but it really matters because

78
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,600
one foster that collaboration between
security researchers between hackers and

79
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,260
companies and even governmental
governmental entities we want to foster

80
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,070
but collaboration because at the end
getting the research to the right to the

81
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:20,650
right hands matters right and this is
for a lot of what my work was focused on

82
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,640
and I'm not alone in this kind of
relaying there are a lot of people that

83
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,510
are operating this remained in fact City
T is part of this work they also

84
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:33,820
collaborated and basically got a lot of
experts in the field of security 50x

85
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,230
which sign a letter to explain that we
need to address this issue of the

86
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:43,300
culture of legal risks that we have in
information security to ensure that we

87
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,500
and bond we want advises the release of
elbow vulnerabilities out there we don't

88
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,500
invite folks quarter and we are able to
foster coordinate disclosure practices

89
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,120
so a lot of ones you're gonna see here
today is basically a means a way to

90
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,350
foster that collaboration to build a
bridge between companies and hackers and

91
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,370
this is focusing specifically on bug
bounties but of course this is just one

92
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,900
example of what we can do in the broader
data system so let me start with this

93
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,409
question about this how many of you
familiar heard about the concept of

94
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,130
course these are programs in which
corporations big corporations and even

95
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,990
other entities are in Buckingham
statistics systems in exchange for

96
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,390
monitoring their interpretation of
reports so how many of you

97
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:35,130
see something that looks like this this
is a background in program that we've a

98
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:41,669
website over by party okay
even from from those for the for the few

99
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,910
that I have here that have seen
something like this have you ever read

100
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:51,839
the legal terms okay great so basically
what we are seeing is this landscape of

101
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:58,020
bug bounties that is operating that all
this matter of invitation to conduct

102
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:04,250
testing all this market even if you will
legal even exchange of abilities is

103
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:10,200
operating under contracts okay so this
is the first kind of inside this this is

104
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,800
an area that is mostly dictated by trans
abuse contracts like EULA's right and

105
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,030
utilizes license agreements that you
probably are canoeing or

106
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:26,699
other I exact terms that you click on on
every no your everyday kind of practices

107
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,860
you go through the internet and I'm
going to be looking at those contracts

108
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,730
and giving you some of the background
and how those contracts interact with

109
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,050
computer crime laws and other aspects
would be see the back bumper lien but

110
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,990
first of all I want to clarify then
again I'm talking about the entire

111
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,370
research before in details
I'm though I'm a lawyer in Israel I'm

112
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:53,820
not your lawyer this is not legal advice
and I'm expressing my own opinions there

113
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,620
you have it you know of the fine cream
the disclaimer just in line with the

114
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,310
other I accept terms that you want to
see here today so the bottom of the

115
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:07,949
phenomena phenomena is really expanding
this is a this is being a trend we know

116
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,190
there is value in that
stand right we have seen it not only in

117
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:17,620
Silicon Valley corporations like Google
Intel Facebook and others but also a

118
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:23,199
more traditional sectors like
transportation aviation and even the

119
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:28,180
government the government has conducted
multiple formats within the center

120
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,870
bombing in the Department of Defense I
think they're into the fifth or sixth

121
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,589
program they're doing right now they
have extended it to more platforms in

122
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:39,339
which they actually invite people from
all over the world to hunt and find

123
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:43,839
vulnerabilities on what you might
consider you know the most substance

124
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,120
systems of all and because of the growth
of this phenomenon it wanted to take a

125
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,160
look and see how we adjusting the legal
landscape to support that because this

126
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,980
is all you can say a newly emerging
field in security but it's definitely

127
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:05,709
expanding very rapidly and our time to
say that Intel the company that I work

128
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:11,410
for also has a bug bounty program that
is very successful so I first of all

129
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,529
would like to invite you all cyber
security professionals here in the room

130
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:19,000
to hunt on our program but the point is
that we're seeing this expansion in

131
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,519
multiple sectors including in the
hardware and firmware sector and this is

132
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,630
just one success story coming out out of
the back bounty relax that there are lot

133
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,189
of conversations
founders that I what I'd love to kind of

134
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:37,260
stress out the more the most is that the
way the battery these programs actually

135
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,910
allow us to develop the pipeline for
track security so this is Jack Campbell

136
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:47,339
any of you know him you know he's a
great guy I just met him a few weeks ago

137
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,060
now he studies in Stanford but this guy
Jack

138
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:57,479
before joining Stanford why after
basically graduating from his last year

139
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,100
in high school got to make that we
turned into ten tomorrow that's after he

140
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,080
participated in multiple programs of the
Department of Defense nearly we need all

141
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,520
the best challenge points out there for
the hack the Pentagon Act the army and

142
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,829
after US Air Force programs and what a
best life about Jack is not only that is

143
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:21,660
really cool nine disability story about
how that buddies are being used to

144
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,199
foster the timeline and get people
excited about security and even hired

145
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,150
them in very non-traditional ways if you
can think about it but also because of

146
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,829
this segments so Jack's tells us that
part what he likes about the bounties as

147
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:41,910
he can eat is able to participate in
paying for skill set in America is legal

148
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:48,360
without having to hide his findings or
to be worried about the legalese or the

149
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,230
implications and I think that is one of
the major advantages of bug bounty and

150
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,950
that is why I want to make sure that as
we are operating in this field we also

151
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:02,850
think about the legal aspects of it and
as I mentioned really cool story that

152
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,390
because of that black multi
participation Jack got to spend three

153
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:11,130
months before
with a Pentagon okay now another

154
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,000
landscape that is really developing is
the vulnerability disclosure landscape

155
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,090
and I want to make sure that I'm
distinguishing between bug bounties and

156
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:22,520
vulnerability disclosure programs so the
main difference between pack bounties

157
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,660
frameworks and which corporations are
invited external hackers to test their

158
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,060
system in exchange for monetary rewards
and vulnerability disclosure programs

159
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,880
which are basically frameworks to create
a channel of communication a weapon

160
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,150
security I'd email process for in which
you details how you're gonna address and

161
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,870
received vulnerabilities from external
researchers that are reported to you

162
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,880
without monetary rewards that's a key
that's the distinction between one

163
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,570
bility disclosure programs and bug
bounties now we also see a major

164
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:02,700
especially anomaly because believe it or
not regulators are actually pushing

165
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:08,210
towards fallibility disclosure products
they are saying that you as a user

166
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,660
corporation is part of your security
maturity as part of your reasonable

167
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:18,030
security practices you need to have that
channel of communication in place so

168
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:22,319
that when someone is fighting someone
something they were able to report it to

169
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,810
you and you need to have a process to
handle that not only that there's deceit

170
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:32,550
in two cases so the main federal the
main regulator who deserve protection in

171
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,140
the Mountain States the Federal Trade
Commission actually mentioned this

172
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:42,030
aspect that needs to have the one
ability disclosure program or the way

173
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:46,199
that is really the process and it can
process a place to receive on abilities

174
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:52,260
into cases in which yes armed with other
circumstances they viewed the lack of

175
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,040
such process unreasonable security
measure

176
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,110
so basically illegal under the law
because of this expansion for mobility

177
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,959
discussion
as well and the fact that it supported

178
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:08,849
by so many regulators are out there we
are also seeing more and more of these

179
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:15,509
policies accepted as well and of course
they have legal implications so let's

180
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:19,499
dive a little bit into the moment
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act the main

181
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:23,910
active hacking federal law in the
nineteen states from here some of you

182
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:29,459
are okay there are misconceptions around
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and I

183
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:33,209
do encourage you to learn more about it
if you're looking for a great resource

184
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:38,729
by the way little Bailey who is one of
the biggest experts out there he's a

185
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,749
special muscle to the DOJ computer crime
division has a lot of talks from

186
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:47,329
blackhat and besides online and it gives
a really great overview of the law

187
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:51,029
including some of the things we're gonna
focus on today so if you're looking as

188
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:54,899
you know for something as an additional
resource that's one thing that is out

189
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,259
there so the Computer Fraud and Abuse
I've been an actual the important

190
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:01,350
concept you need to kind of there are
many things to think about but they

191
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,629
really the poor or that law is like this
notion of authorization and the main

192
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:10,709
language suggests that whoever
intentionally exists accesses a computer

193
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:16,049
without authorization or in a manner
which exceeds the authorization I'm

194
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:20,899
going to speak about that and obtains
information from a protected computer

195
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:25,949
that is defined pretty broadly to
basically include any computer is

196
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:32,939
connected today tracks it is inspecting
commerce shall be punished by this and

197
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:37,919
that etc so this law has both criminal
and civil liability and if you look at

198
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,389
the statistics that is provided by the
Department of Justice interestingly

199
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:46,169
there are not a lot of criminal cases
that are using this provision against

200
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:51,059
security researchers they're really
really not a lot maybe two in all the

201
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:54,809
history of the State Fair the reason
however our additional component a

202
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:59,400
component of similar
which means that private parties can use

203
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,199
the CFA to other private parties
individual companies employees etcetera

204
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:10,380
that part of the CFA is more litigated
when it comes to this section so what I

205
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,940
want you to take away from here is this
idea of fluoridation now if we have any

206
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:20,760
pen testers in the room yeah
so often you take this contract but you

207
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:27,720
always have is consent to test us it's a
key component of any of any contest

208
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,280
contract which interacts with this
provision that relates to authorization

209
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:39,570
it's this idea that I consented for your
testing of my device on my computer now

210
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,850
we do have something that is called
circuit splits and my cervix leak I

211
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:49,679
don't mean an actual circuit I mean
there is a conflict in which different

212
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,840
states inside the United States in the
federal system are interpreting the

213
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,449
opinion and specifically this notion of
optimization and what does it mean to

214
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:08,250
explain conversation and that suite is a
lot of the kind of poor tension and

215
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,180
debate when it comes to state faith I'm
gonna give a very quick overview and

216
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,830
reminding everybody this is not a good
advice you should always seek your own

217
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:24,110
console so there is one key kind of
interpretation that is focusing on

218
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,679
circumvention of technical measures
this means that of authorization is

219
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:34,920
based upon technical measures ok I
include authentication barrier on the

220
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,250
way I could have password wall you need
to you know you need to provide a

221
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,760
concert forget it if you have
circumvented

222
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,960
password you have circumvented a
technical nature technological assurance

223
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:52,910
and answer convention could be exceeding
authorized access so that's one kind of

224
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,480
key interpretation that is being used
mostly in the ninth circuit for example

225
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,010
in the first circuit ninth circuit by
the way is California among others so

226
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:06,590
all the Yukon Valley and that is a
narrow definition to the CFA and it's

227
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,800
notional conversation because you have
to have those technical barriers in

228
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:16,580
place now there is another another kind
of way to think about this and according

229
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,740
to that kind of approach even
circumvention of contract language so

230
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,680
violation of employment contracts could
be exceeding authorization because I

231
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,890
have established the boundaries of the
flurries they should be our contracts

232
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,940
and if you violated something for
example you use the information in a way

233
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,050
that is not consistent with the contract
you have exceeded authorization and

234
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:45,050
violated the CFAA and that approach is
mostly debated and caused a lot of case

235
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:50,419
law and if I can recommend you one case
to look at is the nazil case in which

236
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,410
California looked at this approach and
said wait a minute this is not what the

237
00:19:54,410 --> 00:20:01,100
CFA was meant to address the CFA was
about happy it wasn't about contract

238
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,919
breach of employees so this debate is
still actually ongoing it's a really

239
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,420
interesting debate we have one case in
the DC Circuit so in the Washington area

240
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,920
that is actually looking at the practice
I wouldn't equality so these are people

241
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,530
that reverse-engineer algorithms from
the outside and whether spreading is the

242
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:26,389
violation of the CFAA in public facing
websites so that question of the

243
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:31,160
legality of scraping under the CFA is
actually right now highly debated in one

244
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,850
case in DC and to another case called IQ
in the Ninth Circuit so it's a really

245
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,240
interesting area of the law and I know
you're really curious about that but the

246
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,940
case no but I do encourage you to take a
look it is it is an important area now

247
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,980
in addition to the CFAA the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act we have another one

248
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:54,860
the DMCA how many of you heard about
Nixon many hands right the DIA is very

249
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,780
famous among the security community also
because of the extension and the trial

250
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,410
proceeding proceedings in which the
Copyright Office created a special

251
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,160
exemption for the purpose of good faith
security research so I'm going to talk

252
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,880
about that the reform what's to do with
the CF with the DMCA the density at the

253
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,150
Digital Millennium Copyright have and
the together you get I mean any

254
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:20,350
Copyright Act is in fact a provision
that is prohibiting the circumvention of

255
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:25,189
technological measures that effectively
control the access to software as a

256
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:31,640
copyright protected and there's some
statutory exceptions so the law itself

257
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,980
has exemptions for the purpose of
encryption and research in that area but

258
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,390
they have a lot of limitation for
example for security testing you leave

259
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:46,090
you know you have some conditions that
you need to follow in order to get them

260
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,679
but the copyright that the law also
recognized that with technology

261
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,490
development and innovation we might need
new exemptions from this active hacking

262
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:59,630
provision that we like that we have in a
copyright law so they created a process

263
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,850
a process in which people can go to the
Copyright Office to write to an

264
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,840
administrator regularly runs operating
operating in this field and tell them

265
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,000
give us an exemption for three years
from this anti-circumvention provision

266
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,210
for the purpose of doing something that
we the public need and is not really

267
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:24,830
undermining copyright protection and one
of these exceptions that started already

268
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:29,629
to the 2015
really because of great work many people

269
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:36,529
was actually be nude and expended last
year so we do have an exemption from the

270
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:40,549
DMCA from that specific law remember it
only gives you that the NCAA doesn't

271
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:46,480
deal with the CFAA that still operating
in the background and that extension

272
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,650
enables which it fosters whose face
appear to be our research but it also

273
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:56,450
has some limitations now one the
humanization was the device limitation

274
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:03,260
original 2050 this was actually never
narrowly applied to consumer voting

275
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:08,570
machines and Auto munille among others
and also medical devices but that device

276
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:14,330
limitation was removed so now this this
exemption is applied to many other

277
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,139
devices as well but there are still
other issues like you need to lawfully

278
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,940
acquire the device you need to only
engage in the practice solely for the

279
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,110
for the purpose of good security
research you still need to not violate

280
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,408
any other law including the same there
you're going to talk about that and you

281
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,250
need to carry the the reason we need to
conduct the research in a manner and in

282
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:38,870
an environment that is done to avoid any
harm to individuals or the public which

283
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:43,399
is really the key concern that's why we
are so focused about quoting one ability

284
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:48,260
disclosure because we want to minimize
that harm that potential harm for

285
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:53,120
end-users so you see there are many
conditions to this exception as well but

286
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,489
it's pretty it's already broader it's
applicable and what we knew once already

287
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:04,490
in 2018 so I encourage to keep following
those preceding and where that exemption

288
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,029
lies but most importantly where the
spark battlefield

289
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:13,309
you know gets into that discussion where
does bug bounty interact with that

290
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:19,700
discussion so in fact in that kind of
relationship between all these law the

291
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:25,760
key ideas of conversation also in the
context of the DMCA the practice the

292
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,000
goonies exemption one
the practice that you originally didn't

293
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,020
get the authorization of the owner for
if you have those certification the

294
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,790
percent of the owner then you do not
need that exemption because you you are

295
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,600
you have the consent consent to this
system and the way those laws are

296
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,600
interacting is essentially the backbone
T terms where are we going to see that

297
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,909
notional authorization played out now
when I first conducted this research I'm

298
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:57,590
talking about the year year and a half
ago when I was looking through the

299
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:02,870
torrents of our bounty programs this
notion wasn't as developed we haven't

300
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,500
seen a lot of are going to terms
actually including specifically this

301
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,490
idea of authorization inside their
program and specifically authorizing

302
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,480
access for the purpose of this law but
since then we have created industries

303
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,669
created standards in this area to really
address this tension and use the

304
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:23,630
contracts of the bug bounty to address
some of the legal risk in order to not

305
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:30,020
be relying solely on the DMCA exemption
that as you saw has multiple conditions

306
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:35,960
that you need to address in order to get
it so what is this notion of a bug on

307
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:43,150
the safe harbor so safe harbor the
concept yes we do have something right

308
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:49,610
so this is this is the idea the idea is
in a contract I can give you

309
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:54,620
optimization and I can in my contract in
this case in a bug banking policy

310
00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:02,178
includes our provisions that will allow
you to test and not basically feel that

311
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:06,880
risk or be worried about the legal
implications because I specifically

312
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:14,750
addressed those those risks in a
contract language now in that landscape

313
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:19,370
you're discussed a movement so when I
first did the research again we didn't

314
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:25,309
have a lot of safe harbors out there I
looked at the tentative part of policies

315
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:29,389
and in fact although we that we already
had some guidance for the Department of

316
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:33,320
Justice in there Frank
to talk about where they said you know

317
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,158
these legal considerations with respect
to the CFA it's something you need to

318
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:40,880
consider when you're establishing the
back bounty although we we have that

319
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:47,210
already adoption of safe harbor wasn't
as as popular but then Dropbox was

320
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:52,940
really the first company to come and
adopt a safe harbor into their policy

321
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,350
and I prefer to say that I had something
to do with this in fact I encouraged

322
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:02,178
them to adopt the DMCA exclusion that
you're seeing right there at the time

323
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:06,770
and again is from my work I started a
movement called legal bug bounty it

324
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:11,779
operated on Twitter and I had a lot of
basically specific programs that I I

325
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:15,409
looked at their terms and I published
some tweets around it and I work with

326
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:20,720
many of the companies in Silicon Valley
to foster more adoption of safe harbors

327
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,500
into bug bounties are going to speak a
little bit about that but what this is

328
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:30,520
geared to do is basically take that
contract of the bug bounty and

329
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:37,039
specifically address this question of
anti hacking was within the language of

330
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:44,299
the back party proof so you would expect
to see in this regard again a legal part

331
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:49,250
of a bug bounty not just a technical
scope or definition of what is it now

332
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:54,740
then how much you're going to get for
your bugs and some may be other parts

333
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:59,809
and also apartment is impressive example
the legal concerns and in that part in

334
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:03,649
some respects we're now seeing more safe
harbors learned a language that

335
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:09,289
specifically addresses the issue of
legal risks now why is this important by

336
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:13,250
the way we do have some empirical
research out there that looks at the

337
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,750
market of bug bounties and this is very
important academic work that is done if

338
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,620
you're looking for a little bit you know
of academic work that can give you some

339
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,510
insights about the real economics of
that market I really I really invite you

340
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:30,899
to take a look
but the worth of plastic I tell the

341
00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:35,580
zaccharas now they have multiple papers
in there in this area in fact they're my

342
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,120
co-authors in future work but I'm going
to recommend you to take a look and one

343
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:46,500
of their work looked in 77 policies from
Haku one as of January 2016 so yes this

344
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:52,590
is updated work I recognise that fears
in bug bounty industry is a lot a lot

345
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:57,178
has changed since then
but over but then at the time they found

346
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:03,419
that 17 from 77 analyzed policies had in
fact that clause that suggest that the

347
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:07,830
corporation will not take legal action
if you follow the terms of the bug

348
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:12,449
bounty but they also found that having
that Clause from an from a statistical

349
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:17,789
perspective didn't effect the crowd so
it didn't cause the crowd to change

350
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:21,899
their behavior or to operate differently
just from statistical academic

351
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:26,039
perspective so really interesting but
again we're talking about the partial

352
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:29,639
safe harbor just an obligation under
pristine legal action Knopfler is a sure

353
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:33,658
and also we're talking about data from
January 2016

354
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:37,350
one of the interesting things to see is
how is this what a change now that we

355
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:42,449
have seen such a movement in this area
we also know that sometimes policies

356
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:48,779
have different they have language that
really relies on the reading

357
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:55,200
capabilities of the reader so they also
use this image that is called that is

358
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,040
really areas that is used widely that's
them

359
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:03,320
what they found is that the average
readability score of back parking

360
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:09,020
policies is around 40 which requires
some college education now it could be

361
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,810
because there are a lot of typical terms
in back bounties and it could be just

362
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:17,629
because of how this academic is geared
to offering but it's still very

363
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,110
interesting because we really want to
clarify that language and make sure that

364
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,879
we are communicating the base
communicating in the best way possible

365
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,170
okay so what happened in this safe
harbor movement what we basically saw is

366
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,170
more and more companies agathi this
language and I think one of the

367
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:39,680
interesting things that we also saw this
tesla doing this really noble move so

368
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:44,600
again I have to say that I did have
something the doing is in fact Tesla

369
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,010
gave me one of their challenge points
one of only 20 in the world because of

370
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:55,580
that interaction and what they did in
their language that they not only ate

371
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:00,020
the safe harbor and address the legal
risk in terms of saying that they will

372
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,980
not pursue legal action against hackers
but they also did something that is

373
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,960
pretty novel and they said that if you
are cleared if you are pre-approved

374
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,300
researcher so you need to sign up with
their bug bounty which is public by the

375
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,350
way it's a public work on it so it's
open to all but for the purpose of this

376
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:22,159
provision you need to be a pre approved
researcher if you sign up your Tesla as

377
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:27,140
a bug bounty test not and you have
conducted testing and something went

378
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:33,620
wrong because it could happen you they
will fix it for free if you follow the

379
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,489
guidance of the program and if you sign
up you're here yourself as a researcher

380
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:43,130
then we'll fix it for free so they gave
you waivers from the warranty

381
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:47,450
limitations that they usually have in
their EULA's in the end-user license

382
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:52,310
agreements for the purpose of the bug
bounty and that's one of the kind of new

383
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,040
abilities that we are seeing in this
legal netscape that is really

384
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,750
recognizing that especially when it
comes from cars for example these are

385
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:04,580
very expensive devices so in order to
foster that testing in that cooperation

386
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:09,149
with a crowd
with the external community they had to

387
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:13,140
go and basically create this legal
novella and I think they really deserve

388
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:19,230
are you chat out for that okay so what
are we doing we know that we searchers

389
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:23,280
care about the communication elements
when it comes to one ability disclosure

390
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:28,470
and coordinate one ability disclosure we
know from research that when when they

391
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:32,340
were asked a majority that said that you
know they would like to coordinate and

392
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,699
to coordinate disclosure with a
corporation if they don't do it it's

393
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:40,770
because something went wanted went wrong
in terms of their expectations and we

394
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:45,810
also know that policies and disparities
in this empirical research again ii l

395
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:53,490
the policies that have more contact more
content actually attract more bugs so we

396
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:59,510
know there is a lot of impact to the way
a policy could be drafted in this regard

397
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,840
so what are we doing how we basically
fostering this tonight's game and how

398
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,340
are you operating as an industry in this
community to make that legal landscape

399
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:13,830
more solid and more innovative as the
research continues and as this economy

400
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:18,389
grows so this is one key document and
what I really would like you to alter

401
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:22,620
Michigan up that in this document that
it has actually to the Computer Crime

402
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:29,100
Commission at the DOJ so this is the
people that are really the experts on

403
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:36,300
the CFAA and DMCA are hacking provisions
and then July 2017 that this is why

404
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,379
after I started my research I already
had some research and some presentations

405
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,310
going out there and then in the OJ
published this work that really

406
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:48,210
complement in my work what they do here
is this saying when you are thinking

407
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,660
about what I'm going to be these
cultural programs policies so those

408
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,470
channels of communications that you need
to establish with the crowd to make sure

409
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,830
that when someone finds something they
are able to communicate with you

410
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,310
effectively they are able to report that
and they

411
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:05,210
they're able to find that and you're
handling that correctly when you're

412
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,870
thinking about establishing those
channels and we're when you are thinking

413
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:12,739
about establishing the bug bounty
program which is essentially a standard

414
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:15,889
phone contract it's a
take-it-or-leave-it contract that you

415
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:20,120
are putting on your website or if you're
using a platform

416
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,080
bug bug departments have you heard about
that concept that's the hacker one and

417
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,100
back routes of the world
absolutely so back bounty platforms are

418
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,850
basically market facilitators there are
plot there there there are companies

419
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:37,850
that are coordinating and sending up bug
bounties to allow companies to interact

420
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:43,850
with a crowd and they have their own set
of contracts as well at place so when

421
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:48,679
you are setting up those back bounties
and one ability discussion programs that

422
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:55,340
frameworks gives you a little overview
of what considerations especially from

423
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:00,710
the legal side you should be thinking
about now this is not binding this is

424
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:05,000
our accommodation this is just a list of
consideration it's only seven pages it's

425
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,880
pretty short
I encourage you to think about it I

426
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,440
encourage you to go to your put them to
employ or whatnot whoever you were

427
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,290
working with and tell them have you
thought about a vulnerability disclosure

428
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:19,340
program have you thought about
establishing that channel come in of

429
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,330
communication and when they're doing so
I encourage you to give them this

430
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:27,620
document it's really short again just
set seven pages and what we have in that

431
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:32,630
document are some key considerations for
example them to discuss on how you

432
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,380
should be describing what is the
authorized conduct and what is not

433
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:41,120
authorized in very plain language to
ensure that you have established that

434
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:47,600
communication is very clear and
establish those expectations and we

435
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,069
don't have any discrepancies or
conflicts or question marks to allow the

436
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:56,090
hackers and basically the researchers
that you're inviting to test your system

437
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:01,340
to basically follow the law moreover
they're talking about establishing bound

438
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:07,170
boundaries so one key element is what's
going around with

439
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:13,470
minimize your POC or proof of concept in
order to ensure that you are not putting

440
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:19,319
users data at risk how you minimize your
interactions with users data at all so

441
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:22,920
if you ever swap back bounty for example
you will often see a term staring saying

442
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,809
only use your own you use your
credentials your own dad I've never

443
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:31,770
interacted with the dialog of others
that is a very important element that

444
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:36,299
the Department of Justice kind of
clarifies and emphasized in that

445
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:40,140
document they also talked about this
approach of you have to be prepared you

446
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:46,650
have to be mature in order to to do this
kind of to have it place these kind of

447
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:50,579
programs and they either talk about the
legal language and the safe harbor

448
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:54,960
component that I just showed you with
respect to the authorization and

449
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,250
basically clarifying that we will not
pursue legal action against researchers

450
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:04,349
that are complying with the policy now
all of this is to say we are setting up

451
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:09,390
clear expectations and boundaries this
doesn't mean that you have an approval

452
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:13,980
to do whatever you want this suggests
that the document the bug bounty

453
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,859
contract it's a really important
document you should be reading carefully

454
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:22,230
because that sets the boundaries of the
Flores engine that we just talked about

455
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:27,150
if you remember when we talked about the
CFA yeah in the DMCA in the importance

456
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:33,780
of our ization in the context of anti
hacking laws in addition this document

457
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:39,720
also talks about scoping so in a bug
bounty you will often see a technical

458
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:46,009
scope which is important by the way if
you see a bug bounty without and scope

459
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:52,829
that should raise an a question mark
because this old notion of scope it's

460
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:58,200
basically what am i inviting you to test
and when you are preparing that scope

461
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,939
you need to know what's going around in
your scope in order to ensure that if

462
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,960
you are providing a post safe harbor
authorization you are actually in the

463
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,440
legal position to do so and you're not
authorizing

464
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,060
staying on other people's product so
this is this notion that you need to

465
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,859
consider what kind of components and
data you are putting in scope that might

466
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:25,980
implicate third party interest now you
also need to setup this according to the

467
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,040
Department of Justice according to this
document you also need to set

468
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,630
expectation then it comes to perfect
concept so what are you exactly

469
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:38,190
expecting from the crown when it comes
to the type of proof concept that they

470
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,520
are delivering to you where do you want
the crowd to stop

471
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:49,770
is it an exploit or what is the level of
kind of POC that you would like to see

472
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:54,030
from them to ensure that you are
protecting your users now these are some

473
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:58,079
of the considerations that you really
need to drill on and I mean one of my

474
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,730
key elements are main key messages to
everyone considering back parties out

475
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:07,800
there especially if this is a bug bounty
in which you are actively paying money

476
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,440
for research and inviting the justice
system do anything for the legal leaves

477
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:18,150
my prior work again that I've conducted
two years ago has showed multiple

478
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:22,470
programs in which there was no legal
part at all how many of us so there I

479
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,859
don't we don't have a lot of hunters
there but the hunters here might not be

480
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:29,910
surprised to hear that they probably saw
in the past a bug bounty with no legal

481
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:34,649
part at all because that was a phenomena
out there and I'm proud to say that you

482
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:38,339
know since then the market really
matured there is excellent work done by

483
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:47,549
DOJ another work that I'm going to share
with you here some more but it was it

484
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:53,670
was a thing so one of my key messages is
when even if if you're on hunter or if

485
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:57,200
you are program manager or if you're
considering anything along the lines

486
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,368
make sure that you consult your lawyer
because this has legal aspects that you

487
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:06,900
need to consider now this question by
the way is not just emerging here it's

488
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,700
also emerging in new york this is in
fact a very interesting document

489
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:17,339
prepared by CPS that's a task force that
reviewed all of the european computer

490
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:21,299
I'm landscape in the context of on
ability disclosure and what they

491
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:26,759
suggested is this issue of legal
liability due to some of the laws there

492
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:30,900
as well is a little bit murky and we
need to think as industry what we can do

493
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,400
in that regard
okay so again as I mentioned if you're

494
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,999
not familiar with my work again this
project you tell this song my prior work

495
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:45,718
I try to get industry to push industry
to to adopt more safe harbors and

496
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:50,430
basically standardize that landscape of
the legal language of both parties now

497
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:54,598
you all are familiar with standards how
many of you are familiar with open

498
00:40:54,599 --> 00:41:00,719
source licenses right or Creative
Commons which is the general license

499
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:06,599
that we have in the copyright community
that allows access to work basically by

500
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:10,710
enabling the owner to use one contract
to waive some of their rights in the

501
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:15,539
creation will go the law default is
something else those type of license are

502
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:20,369
operating as a standard and because
there is one car one contract there are

503
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:23,940
many benefits that are associated with
that and I'm going to talk about that

504
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:29,309
but my main kind of focus area and that
in this work was actually to work with a

505
00:41:29,309 --> 00:41:33,960
lot of companies again to foster the
adoption of these terms and one way that

506
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:40,920
I did that with the help of coin here
Ryan who is actually cyber con organizer

507
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,759
right or founder even though or not
absolutely

508
00:41:44,759 --> 00:41:50,789
that's that's amazing is to create this
big of a bounty hunter orange reserved

509
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:55,769
only for companies that I know time
adopted a safe harbor okay what I also

510
00:41:55,769 --> 00:42:00,808
did is to create this github repository
where I wanted to establish a language

511
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:05,729
that lawyers of companies can take a
look of course the you know people saw

512
00:42:05,729 --> 00:42:08,189
their own legal advice but this we had
one

513
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:12,780
my standards that people can take a look
at and was informed by the Department of

514
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:17,849
Justice framework to consider when they
are drafting their mark on the policy

515
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:22,200
and I'm proud to say that you have
recently adopted this language and

516
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:29,038
created another fork of that language to
kind of better better situated the

517
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:36,780
language as this landscape develops and
again Dropbox also adopted this language

518
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:41,190
and the interesting thing here is that
we sued the crowd is that in and out so

519
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:46,289
Justin here Alan is a great guy as well
he says you know way to God Dropbox

520
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:50,880
adopting this policy I'm going to be
hunting on a program because of this now

521
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,369
since since I started this legal bug
bounty movement and stomach work I

522
00:42:56,369 --> 00:43:02,130
collaborated with background to start
disclose I know disclose AO is another

523
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:06,299
physician project in which all of you
can take a look and check out their

524
00:43:06,299 --> 00:43:10,500
language six to create one language for
bug bounty programs that is also

525
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:17,190
addressing this legal landscape issue
and it's open source you can all use it

526
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:22,950
they just in think that back pad also
did is incorporate disclosed i/o into

527
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:27,390
their filtering system so as a hunter if
you are professional hunter and you want

528
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:32,400
to take a look at programs that are that
have language that includes safe harbor

529
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,930
you can actually filter in their
platform for programs that have a safe

530
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:41,578
harbor I think that that's one of the
recommendations that I originally did in

531
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:46,559
my prior work and on in my larger paper
and they adopted it and I think it's a

532
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,119
great it's a great system and a great
tool I mean that this is a selection is

533
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,559
key because then we have one language
and we have one standard and this really

534
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:59,730
serves the benchmark and reduces the
information burden on the researchers or

535
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:05,539
in the crowd and raises awareness
towards decision and it also it gives us

536
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:11,520
transactional cost drastic costs right
because you need to consult a lawyer but

537
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,880
at least
we have something one language

538
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:19,939
certificate all quite a thing to agree
on now this type of work will actually

539
00:44:19,939 --> 00:44:24,949
be key as we see that expansion of back
monkeys into new areas and new arenas

540
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:30,859
for example this Facebook's newly data
abuse program that is focusing on using

541
00:44:30,859 --> 00:44:35,929
the bug bounty not to encounter security
flaws but to uncover privacy violations

542
00:44:35,929 --> 00:44:41,140
in fact that can also share with you
guys that I'm a proud recipient of a 10

543
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:47,629
$10,000 $10,000 but not me alone me in
my quarters from UC Berkeley on a

544
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:53,089
privacy enhancing type of academic work
so as we are moving this backpack the

545
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:56,719
concept to new areas and your rayna's it
would be important to also look at the

546
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:00,739
legalese so finally and I'm about to
finish up I just want to put here on the

547
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:07,400
screen some research some basically
websites and some that points you can

548
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,779
all seek and look for if you're looking
for more information from the new jframe

549
00:45:11,779 --> 00:45:17,869
work I also did a podcast with general
Baili again great expert on the CFAA

550
00:45:17,869 --> 00:45:23,239
from the Department of Justice but we
only focused on issues of deep bug

551
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:28,369
bounty kind of legalese including the
interaction with extortion there is a

552
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:35,059
recent CFA indictment that involved
Linda subsidiaries did that in fact

553
00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:39,259
involve the bug bounty and someone
coming to a party with an extortion at

554
00:45:39,259 --> 00:45:43,160
CFA event it's a very interesting and
Agnes the first one that I'm aware of

555
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:48,140
that has an interaction with the CFA a
so that's another thing to take a look

556
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,990
at it if you want
and we discussed it a look at at the

557
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:56,000
post task that also puts you here the
links for that encourage you to take a

558
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,750
look at our standardization work
disclosed ago and little bug bounty and

559
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:03,680
if you want to see my prior work in this
