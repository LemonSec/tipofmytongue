1
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,520
Welcome everyone.
This is more than Tor: Shining a Light on

2
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,970
Different Corners of the Dark Web. If
you're looking for a different talk

3
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,540
you're actually in the right one. This is
the better one, I promise.

4
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:41,660
So, you have to excuse me if I do yawn.
Because of all the flight delays, I

5
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,720
didn't get into the hotel until like
6:00 a.m. So I'm like draggin'. But, my name

6
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,210
is Benjamin Brown and my day job is with
Verecode and I'm a principal security

7
00:00:53,210 --> 00:01:01,010
researcher there. So some of my focus is
lately, have been darknets and crypto

8
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:08,450
currencies, emerging digital underground
economies,  public policy in emerging

9
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,670
technology in general. And how can I make
it do stuff it wasn't necessarily

10
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:20,350
designed to do and what are the
ramifications of that? I also want to

11
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:26,059
start out with some groundwork, some
context in terms of definitions. A lot of

12
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,320
times the terms dark net and dark web
are used interchangeably, usually by

13
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,360
media or law enforcement. But they do
have distinct meanings. One actually

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,990
builds on the other. When I'm talking
about Darknets, I'm talking about a

15
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:44,509
framework that has software and
configurations that require you to set

16
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:49,970
it up for you to run and access those
networks. And they're not networks that

17
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,479
are separate from the internet, they're
actually overlay networks at this point.

18
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:58,610
There are some alpha and beta networks
that are trying to be sort of outside of

19
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,509
the Internet as is, but the major
Darknets that we're going to be looking

20
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:06,799
on, sit on top of what we understand as
being the regular Internet or the clear

21
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,829
net. And the Dark Web, that's the
composite of web content from all of

22
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:18,350
these different Darknet frameworks. And
again, they require specific software

23
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:26,418
configurations or authorization to
access. Why do I think this talk is worth

24
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:33,530
giving? Because I think the vast
miss portrayals of the Dark Web and

25
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,190
different Darknet frameworks in the
media, by law enforcement, or by

26
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,020
government entities can easily lead to a
skewed perspective of what that threat

27
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:47,260
landscape actually is and what sort of
budget you should be putting towards it.

28
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:54,019
Also, there's been a whole lot of new
vendors in the space that are trying to

29
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:02,720
sell you Dark Web insights at ridiculous
numbers usually. And understanding what

30
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,410
the threat landscape is actually like
and how easy it is to go and look for

31
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,870
yourself, or someone on your team to do
so,  could really help you in better

32
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,360
molding. Alright how am I going to put
resources towards maybe this particular

33
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:24,860
facet of our threat modeling or threat
assessment? So what makes these different

34
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:30,260
Darknet frameworks unique from one
another? Well I can't get away with not

35
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,190
talking about Tor, it is definitely the
largest and heaviest trafficked and the

36
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:40,730
most talked about. And it's in it itself, is
privacy oriented. But a lot of the

37
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:46,310
offerings on it are commercialized. That
you can find all kinds of data dumps

38
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,890
and hacker tools and stuff like that but
um, you got a pay. OpenBazaar, this one is

39
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:58,880
purely commercialized and this is a
newer one. It's not privacy oriented,

40
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,829
but there are some optional privacy
features you can use. To get an idea of

41
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:09,800
what the user base being targeted is
like, the two biggest currencies that are

42
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:16,970
in use are US dollars and Bitcoin. That's
followed by the euros, the pound sterling,

43
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:26,150
Canadian dollars and a good smattering of
verbal use. I2P a rguably the second most

44
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:33,289
well-known Darknet framework. This one is
indeed privacy centric. It's based

45
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,460
not necessarily on keeping the content
private, so much is the identity of the

46
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,229
users. And it has a balance between
both ideologically

47
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:47,830
oriented free information and also
it does have some commercial aspects as

48
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:53,469
well. In terms of the content itself and
what languages you'll find, if you use

49
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,380
just the major I2P official announcement
nodes, the content you'll find there is

50
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,670
mostly English. But if you also include
the content on the third party or

51
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,510
unofficial nodes, the Russian language
content far outweighs the English

52
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,849
language. And then of course there are
enclaves of Chinese language content, of

53
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:18,910
French language and Japanese as well.
There were a couple of Brazilian, but not

54
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:24,390
not very many.
That's Brazilian Portuguese. For Free Net,

55
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:32,320
that as opposed to necessarily making
its focus the privacy of its users, it's

56
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,060
the resiliency of its content. To be able
and protect itself and its network

57
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:44,410
against a censorship by an oppressive
regime or by some other entity. And most

58
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,680
of the content there,z there's hardly any
commercialization at all on Free Net.

59
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,980
Most of the content there absolutely is
free and it's a lot of it's ideologically

60
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:01,020
motivated. In terms of the users, the
geographies that they're coming from...

61
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:08,260
it's mostly the US and the UK, or the US
and Europe rather. Followed by Japan,

62
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:18,130
Russia and Brazil. A little, a little more
about Tor to give you an idea about like

63
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,020
how long it's been around and what it
uses. It's been around, it's publicly

64
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,390
released in 2002 but it was in
development by the US government before

65
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:33,640
that. Before it was handed over to a public
entity. It relies on the onion service

66
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,930
protocol. If you want to learn more about
that, I'll put a link to the white paper

67
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,130
at the end of this talk, that goes much
more into the technical weeds of the

68
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,870
different topologies and different ways
in which these networks are set up and

69
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,729
the
technology that it uses. This is mostly

70
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:56,258
focused on privacy and security for
Internet users. Specifically Tor wants to

71
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:00,460
make it really easy for people to have a
higher level of privacy while on the

72
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,870
Internet. And they do that by you know,
putting their browser bundle together so

73
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:12,699
you don't have to do a whole lot of
configuration yourself. So I'll show

74
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,199
you some numbers for Tor mean daily
users and then you can see that compared

75
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,259
to some of the later numbers for the
other Darknet frameworks and see just

76
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:26,110
how much of a bear Tor is in terms of
user usage. So the the US,  Germany and the

77
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:32,229
UAE make up a large chunk of where user,
users are coming from. The reason why the

78
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:37,690
UAE is so high on that list, is because
for just about all of the Arab states in

79
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,639
the in the area, they're all
funneling through the UAE major Tor

80
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:50,560
nodes. And then again, Russia's
following that up. As you've heard on

81
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,750
media were for law enforcement
announcements you can find drugs, weapons,

82
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:02,080
really overpriced weapons, hacking tools
and guides. The hacking tools and guides

83
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,400
that are for sale, most of them you can
find for free on the clear net so... Ahh.

84
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,940
There's definitely malware. Most of it is
malware that's been cracked before and

85
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:20,139
if you do have it, find any listings for
you know, a piece of malware that's newer

86
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:24,789
and hasn't really been reversed, it's
gonna cost you a lot more. Leaked

87
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:29,169
databases you can find for sure. Usually
those are used for account stuffer

88
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:35,949
activities or account checker activities.
But again, all this is at a price, no one's

89
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,570
giving these away for free really on
Tor. Also, whenever you read or hear

90
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,810
something about hitmen on the dark web,
it's bullshit.

91
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:49,899
Like no professional contract killer is
gonna take some bitcoins from some kid

92
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:54,160
angry on xbox live. Like he's gonna stay
with organized crime because that's

93
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,120
less liability

94
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,680
Besides all the gnarly stuff that you
hear about, there's also some pretty cool

95
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,290
other offerings on Tor. Like a lot of
whistle blower support. If they're finding

96
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:13,000
they're not getting traction internally
with the entity that they work for, then

97
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,520
they can anonymously give some evidence
and some idea to these different

98
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,460
whistle blower organizations that are
external.

99
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,080
There's also projects for censorship
evasion from oppressive regimes and

100
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,460
privacy from surveillance in general. A
lot of those are still pretty much in

101
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,810
their infancy and there are ways for a
deterrent state backed entity with enough

102
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:42,280
resources to, to get around those. There's
a lot of personal blogs and forums. Most

103
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,260
of the forums are like mundane talk
topics that people might not feel real

104
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,810
well revealing who they are talking
about it like... Maybe some rather raunchy

105
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,719
fanfics
or something like that. But also there's

106
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,770
a lot of medical forums where people who
have a certain you know, medical issue

107
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:04,120
and want to be able to talk to others
that also have it. But they are

108
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,090
embarrassed or don't want their name
connected to that. There's also a

109
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:18,040
Facebook portal for some reason Facebook
stood it up so you can anonymously log

110
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:27,969
in to your account that has all of your
information I don't know the new kid on

111
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:33,000
the block opened Bazaar again this is
like focused solely on e-commerce

112
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,970
specifically that what they want to do
is get away from the model of eBay and

113
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,920
of you know Amazon and other outlets
where you have to pay fees whenever

114
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,930
you're selling things so they don't have
any fees for their transactions and

115
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:53,620
their system is peer to peer the network
itself uses the IP FS the interplanetary

116
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,810
file system again the longer may produce
more into that and how it works but

117
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,930
transactions themselves between buyers
and sellers are based on Ricardian

118
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:08,670
contracts that's been around for quite
awhile I think like 12 years now

119
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,930
and it's been tested in quite a
different number of applications for

120
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:20,310
transactions in terms of who's using
this the main language support that the

121
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:25,369
developers have out and how is for
English Brazilian Portuguese and French

122
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,600
but they are currently developing more
languages and starting to try and crowd

123
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:38,160
source it more I believe the next one is
Spanish and then after that Russian in

124
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,569
terms of the listings as I mentioned
before it's mostly US dollars and

125
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:47,250
Bitcoin and you can see that you know
just just what your numbers those are

126
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:52,770
what most users are transacting in so
what sort of stuff can you buy on with

127
00:11:52,770 --> 00:12:01,319
them bazaar right now you can party I
mean the prices are outrageous but yeah

128
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,030
there's definitely just about any
illicit substance you can find on there

129
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:13,470
you can get some IDs passports you could
say that you graduated from Harvard and

130
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:18,120
get it on fancy paper or three
flattering and everything also if

131
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,570
somebody is selling a passport for a
thousand dollars especially a US

132
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:26,850
passport it's gonna be a piece of shit
like you're gonna be looking more like

133
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:37,740
six to ten thousand dollars for a legit
one so I write I don't have a bug-out

134
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,590
bag or anything so there are some other
things you get like hacked accounts for

135
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:48,750
snapchat and if you want to do a stroke
mostly this is for Astroturf a so you

136
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:53,700
buy a whole bunch of LinkedIn Facebook
and snapchat accounts and then you know

137
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,010
you can make it look like you have a
whole bunch of followers and your

138
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:02,960
business is totally legit streaming
services you can go ahead and buy those

139
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,190
for cheaper than the monthly costs would
be but chances are it's gonna get shut

140
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:15,690
down in a few months so your mileage may
vary some hacking tools you can

141
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,899
definitely buy those I understand why it
says

142
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,139
if there were some lead NSA hacking
tools but they got a little happy with

143
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:28,680
the three-letter acronyms and added FBI
and CIA I guess to seem legit but yeah

144
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,498
it's it's mostly outdated software like
that what's that finder bug has been

145
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:39,089
patched though that blue screen is
really interesting because this is an

146
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:45,209
account checker program that also has
bought fingerprint evasion techniques so

147
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:49,170
human emulation techniques that like
randomly move the mouse around both the

148
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:53,279
website and like we'll skip between
different dialog boxes maybe not in

149
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,779
order and we'll slow down how it's
entering things over time so it's not

150
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:02,369
like oh it's obviously Bacchus is doing
everything in split second and so I

151
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:04,649
thought I thought that was pretty neat
because those are the sorts of things

152
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:09,779
that a lot of the bots stopping about
tracking then their software usually

153
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:15,059
looks at so this was fun this was
somebody that was offering hacking

154
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:22,800
services hacking emails bank accounts
school results and so it was interesting

155
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,120
to see that probably about a month later
instead of having their listing for

156
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,740
hacking you know all these accounts and
stuff

157
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,839
now they offer consultation services for
business intelligence marketing

158
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:42,899
operations projects and security as the
exact same contact information so I

159
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,079
thought that was interesting and the
reason why I started seeing these

160
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,399
changes is because open Bazaar is
starting to block some of these more

161
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:57,199
illicit listings so it's not necessarily
a free-for-all I tried to find weapons

162
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:04,670
I found a grease gun and a nerd from
average it looks like it's been painted

163
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:11,969
it's pretty good quite sexually I did
find a flame thrower so I mean you can

164
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,889
get that you know on the clear head from
somebody who bought it from Elon Musk's

165
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:25,079
company yes yeah or or clearing snow
whatever so there's this those things

166
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:29,339
are cute and funny and like Oh drugs
hacking but the vast majority of stuff

167
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:33,420
on open Bazaar
by far is like really Monday stuff like

168
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,610
people selling their jewelry or people
selling you know their own original

169
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:47,040
artwork excuse me phone cases speakers
now I don't know if those speakers fell

170
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,120
off a backwards rocker not like I'm
gonna go with its public legit

171
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,820
there was one store that I was super
excited about because they sold

172
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:01,590
hard-to-find antique collectors books
and some of them were reasonably priced

173
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:06,530
pretty good there's another couple
vendors that all they sell are cactuses

174
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:13,560
diffusers and then somebody that makes
their own clothing as I mentioned before

175
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,040
open Bazaar starting to block the
illicit offerings but it's really weird

176
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,459
how they're doing it because they're
just blocking it from the main search

177
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,550
results the listings are still there so
if you have the direct link you can

178
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:28,859
still go to it and so third-party
searches have started to pop up they

179
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:34,290
very scrape and find all of those
listings that have been taken down from

180
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:42,020
the main search Frieda this one there is
love interesting stuff I found on here

181
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,949
it's been around for a while it was
originally released in 2000 and it's

182
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,600
really trying to be censorship resistant
and the way it does this is by using

183
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,680
treated data stores and so if you take
down one or a handful of nodes you'll

184
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,109
still be able to access the network's
content or people's free sites just by

185
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:10,319
contacting a different mode in terms of
user demographics you can see these

186
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,899
numbers are quite a bit lower than then
tours but still I mean a good chunk of

187
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,610
people are using it the United States
and then Europe followed by Japan Russia

188
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:29,639
and Brazil and the leaked data that you
can find is all free and nobody's trying

189
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,190
to get a Bitcoin out of you for it if
you want to look up Ashley Madison dumps

190
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,900
or adult friend finder dumps to see how
many pots were on there or to suit your

191
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:46,290
bosses on there
do that the emails from the French head

192
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:52,110
of state Emmanuel Macomb though I do
want to put a little caveat and note

193
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:56,850
here it has been confirmed that some of
these emails before they were released

194
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:06,810
were altered likely by Eastern European
actors during the TTIP negotiations for

195
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:12,780
for trade rules and for copyright rules
and stuff like that the Greenpeace had

196
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,370
an insider that was able to leak all of
the confidential documents from that so

197
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:24,510
if you want to go back and read those
you can this one's scary so these are

198
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:29,940
this is a dump of internal emails from
Diebold employees who work on Diebold's

199
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,260
voting machines and essentially the
employees saying like these voting

200
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,440
machines are terrible they're really
insecure I don't know why people keep

201
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,760
buying them there's a lot of problems
with them and like these are the

202
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:48,920
machines that like 37 different states
had so cute

203
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:55,520
a couple of disparate groups that are
under the heading Anonymous by their own

204
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:02,790
say so got together and pulled together
from a lot of different activities where

205
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,930
they had gone into sheriff's office
networks or into a police precinct

206
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:12,990
networks and gotten internal documents
mostly how to box things like you know

207
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:19,080
what's the digital forensic process for
this particular police office how do

208
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,399
they pull artifacts from wireless
routers how do they investigate websites

209
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,780
such as Craigslist so you can know how
law enforcement does those things

210
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:34,290
step-by-step including how they search
cell phones have they do captures of

211
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,610
cell phone data and things like that

212
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:44,310
because it is anti-censorship
oriented you do unfortunately find a bit

213
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:51,149
of a few paid groups on there mostly
white supremacists and they'll they say

214
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,590
and
about the reason why they're on Freenet

215
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,720
is because on the clear that all of
their hosts kept kicking them off

216
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:05,110
rightly so and so now the only place you
will find a lot of their content other

217
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:10,928
than the strong front is on free net
you'll also find a lot of things like

218
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:18,250
poisoning hand books you want to do that
but also the one with far left was much

219
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,570
more interesting to me it's an
eco-terrorism hand book like how to ruin

220
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:27,340
logging equipment how to you know take
down the oil pipelines things like that

221
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,550
and it's obviously like some really
smart engineers that know what they're

222
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:36,669
talking about that are going into it Oh
a LF the Animal Liberation Front still

223
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:41,020
has an active presence on Freenet and
like mostly they're doing documentation

224
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:46,929
of like their past activities and stuff
like that but there's also still some

225
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:52,090
updated content from them
on there this one was cute

226
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:57,189
this was a step by Store is a step by
step guide and Chinese on how to

227
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:03,910
assassinate Xi Jinping the head of China
and it was weird because it's very very

228
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:09,280
dispassionate and like just like a
checklist of things like oh this part of

229
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,200
you know the buildings that you might be
near have CCTV here here here so you'll

230
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,520
want to take this route instead and it's
just like a special thought way too much

231
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:25,960
about this there are blogs for how to
write malware and how to avoid D

232
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,380
compilation or reverse engineering of
your malware you can find those on the

233
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:37,420
clear net too but I was just interesting
to see them there this one was absurd so

234
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,220
this is an anonymous collective and how
they set themselves apart from the rest

235
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,929
of anonymous is their ham radio
enthusiasts that are skating the radio

236
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:53,080
waves for I don't know threats and
protecting us from them they never go

237
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,399
into detail about what those threats are
so I don't know it could be aliens could

238
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,220
be the government human trafficking
they wouldn't say but they really really

239
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:10,619
like ham radio and masks there's a lot
of socio-political sites a lot of

240
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:15,899
libertarian sites and blogs a lot of
anarcho-capitalist sites whatever that

241
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:22,709
means a lot of book or sites and
anarchic communists again those are

242
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:28,409
funny to me like so no central
government but central planning I don't

243
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:35,639
I don't know how that works maybe
somebody can tell me about it but there

244
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:40,949
are a lot of other things that like
aren't scary or quote-unquote dark and

245
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,729
the vast majority of the content is just
hobbyist so there are a bunch of

246
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:47,669
different social networks
some of them active some of them just

247
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:52,799
people continuously saying is anybody
here there's a bunch of co-chairing

248
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,168
initiatives github clone where people
are actively building stuff together

249
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:06,869
most of it mundane and there is just a
metric crap ton of amateur novelists on

250
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:11,849
Freenet it's amazing how much content
there is and it's not all like weird

251
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:17,369
very fanfic either it's like there's
like legit high fantasy and sci-fi

252
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:21,840
that's pretty good and I think they
should get published but yeah if you if

253
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,609
you want to read some new content that's
not like published out widely go check

254
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:32,460
out Freenet though my favorite site had
to be this geo cities looking John Wayne

255
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:38,039
site I mean this is a static picture so
it doesn't show it but it legit had a

256
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:41,879
scrolling blinking marquee going across
it I was surprised I weren't this little

257
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:48,449
flame that gifts to but it was just like
like wave files of John Wayne saying

258
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:53,849
stuff and like quotes and stuff about
his life and where you grew up and it

259
00:23:53,849 --> 00:24:03,509
was just very wholesome ITP is a mixed
bag as I mentioned before and it's it's

260
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:09,840
looking at both commerce options but
also there has its fair

261
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,629
I've ideologically motivated free
content and it's initially released in

262
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,150
2003 so it's also been around for a
while

263
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:23,490
and it uses an anonymizing PGP
distributed communication layer to try

264
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:31,230
and keep monitoring of its users and its
users activity to a minimum though if

265
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:35,040
you can control enough gnomes
like I believe the Dutch government did

266
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:42,570
very early on in ITV's inception then
they candy anonymize people in terms of

267
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:48,899
numbers more users than Freenet for sure
but the best majority of them in the

268
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:57,210
United States in Russia some interesting
things I found the cryptocurrency that's

269
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:03,840
in most use on ITP was not bitcoins
Monaro which was like cool to see then

270
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:10,560
there was also a large selection of
users of cost point I study crypto

271
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,970
currencies I have no idea what Gauss
point it's so I'm like what is this but

272
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:20,430
there are mining pools exchanges and
tumbling services for both and Gauss

273
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:27,330
point is really IGP centric it has
hardly any clear net footprint but

274
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:31,050
there's their description of what it is
is a digital currency based on

275
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:35,790
blockchain technology okay yeah it
allows instant payments were wired with

276
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,659
focus on privacy and security of its
users alright so tries to master its

277
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,830
users and what they're doing it uses
Russian government standard cryptography

278
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:50,730
that doesn't mean anything but they do
have give access to the code base so you

279
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:55,380
can't go and review it yourself to see
if you think that they're using legit

280
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,360
crypto and they're not just like rolling
their own primitives like idiots don't

281
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:09,360
roll your own crypto oh and the vast
majority since I've seen for it it was

282
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:16,290
money laundering if you want to use
Specter or meltdown and don't want to

283
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:20,420
like find out how it works and build it
yourself

284
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:26,060
somebody
for free the tool and see how to guide

285
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:31,190
on using it and for some reason PDF
copies of the Wikipedia pages for the

286
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:37,390
attacks in case you don't want to go to
Wikipedia I guess but yeah that's free

287
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:41,720
then there was some something I saw that
had posted on a number of different

288
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:48,410
forums on ITP or each sites and this is
a Russian and English speaker that is

289
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:53,270
trying to hire botnet herders or bot net
owners saying that you know if you have

290
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:59,540
a mil plus machines on your botnet I'll
pay $25 for 15 minutes of use I mean

291
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,010
that's that adds up that's pretty good
money

292
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:08,960
there were people selling o days they
were crappy o days like two of them were

293
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:15,770
O'Day's for Internet Explorer like who
wants that and then there's a new hacker

294
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:19,430
community that's being announced there
and that was interesting because for to

295
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,870
get access to that one you can't pay to
access it they give you a target that

296
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,840
you don't know beforehand like a website
and then you have to prove that you've

297
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,870
hacked that target and then there's also
a botnet that you can hire the Deucalion

298
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:39,350
there's a really crappy button that an
easy to block don't buy it the most

299
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:46,100
interesting thing I found on IGP though
was this activist collective they say

300
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:51,889
that their service for sec ops admins
and activists but they provide like that

301
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:56,150
a couple of tools that are based on
their sites ignore that use your own IP

302
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:00,620
address you know you can go and looked
at hacked cameras you can go in spider

303
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,850
and website for vulnerabilities you
could go in use their low orbit ion

304
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:14,389
cannon which is just a terrible tool but
they also taught live classes and like

305
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,310
legit interactive live classes on
writing malware hacking different

306
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:24,560
websites but the last two the advances
without exploitation and the exotic web

307
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,550
application vulnerabilities I went
through and looked at the archive of

308
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,850
those and the teacher definitely knew
their stuff and knew what they were

309
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:38,330
talking about it was really
and at the end they posted a link to

310
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:43,879
their slides now the bend that was
holding their slides how to use her name

311
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:50,360
attached to it a pretty unique one they
weren't very good at OPSEC that username

312
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:57,549
leads directly back to a director in a
very large firm in our industry that

313
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:04,129
sells web protection web application
protection software so I mean I guess

314
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,730
it's a sustainable business model like
you teach activists that I packed my

315
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:13,520
back's axe and then you sell you know
the web map protection as well but I'm

316
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:23,809
not gonna help them but yeah OPSEC it's
hard and so that stuff's the interesting

317
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:27,980
stuff the vast majority again the same
as the others it's mundane stuff

318
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,000
hobbyists people just playing around
there are gateways for cross traffic to

319
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,429
other darknet frameworks Cindy which is
mostly file-sharing zero net which is

320
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:41,539
new doesn't have a whole lot of users
yet tour of course and then there's a

321
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:47,658
telegram portal mostly used by Russian
language speakers there are also social

322
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:53,450
media instances on there no Facebook on
this one but they do have a diaspora she

323
00:29:53,450 --> 00:30:00,049
dies for instances over Qian don't
Google that one long life box and then

324
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:06,350
some basic like to treat forums there's
I get services free encrypted file

325
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:12,980
stores there's a Usenet network running
on ITP paste bedclothes clones if you

326
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,510
don't want to rely on mi t--'s PGP key
server there's one for you there on ITP

327
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:23,090
I don't know if I would trust it more or
less there's a not shady at all dot are

328
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:28,699
you registrar you can use on ITP yeah
it's totally not for malicious

329
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:34,970
activities the largest and most active
forum I found on ITP though was a

330
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:39,860
gardening forum it was great it was like
people talking about like oh my yield of

331
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,769
lavender was time
whoa and I think I might have a fungal

332
00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:46,580
infection in the bed it's like oh well
you can make this tea and pour it over

333
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,269
there like every two weeks and mental
health and I don't know it was very

334
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:54,769
wholesome that's great if you want to
play chess but you want to do so

335
00:30:54,769 --> 00:31:03,200
anonymously you can do that too
take that Yahoo games does anybody know

336
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,349
what thinners cards is okay so this is
supposedly an ESP test or you have to

337
00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:12,769
guess the next symbol that's going to be
on the card and there's an interactive

338
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:22,009
version of that on there so you can see
if you have ESP or not there's a really

339
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:26,299
cool ASCII art database which I mean the
only place I really still see this is in

340
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:31,700
the demo scene so it was nice to see
that there was this really angelfire

341
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:38,539
looking edgy 13 year old and a basement
probably service called Osiris's tomb

342
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:45,919
and it's all like his like original emo
artwork and god I'm glad my stuff is not

343
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,779
still on the internet from that time
period but yeah again it was another

344
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:56,859
chat room for people to talk and it was
mostly people saying is anybody here

345
00:31:56,859 --> 00:32:01,249
but anybody can figure out what the hell
this is I would be grateful

346
00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:05,840
I think it's an art installment I don't
think it's a puzzle because I sent it

347
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,478
for like an hour going through each
iteration of it and whenever you click

348
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:12,109
on it it changes the colored dots and I
don't know if you can see is the

349
00:32:12,109 --> 00:32:16,908
lighting but each thought has an arrow
pointing out of it from to a different

350
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:20,869
direction and when I was looking through
it it seemed to be pretty random I

351
00:32:20,869 --> 00:32:25,609
couldn't find a pattern but I think it's
just an art installment but I'd like to

352
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:30,259
find out if it's something more if you
want to I'll put my email at the end and

353
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:35,690
if you want a link to that I can send it
to you all right so what's the

354
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:40,720
conclusions or the sub conclusions that
you know we could draw from these things

355
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,040
the dark web and the dark Nets content
in general isn't nearly as

356
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,909
dark as the media or law enforcement
would lead you to believe I mean it

357
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:53,630
makes sense that they would present it
that way because they get more you know

358
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,960
losing AHS and cliques and law
enforcement our government would then

359
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,910
get you know a better argument for a
larger budget next year things like that

360
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:08,120
so they were definitely incentives for
that but if you go and look for yourself

361
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,179
the types of content that's going to be
on there that are going to be a direct

362
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:16,130
threat to your business are pretty low
if you aren't bank it might make sense

363
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:21,040
for you to be on the lookout for credit
card dumps but for most other content

364
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:26,330
you don't really need to spend a whole
lot of money on that on getting on fancy

365
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:31,159
the third-party vendor stuff for it
most of the illicit activity is actually

366
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,120
still occurring on the clear night if
you're you know looking for human

367
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,129
trafficking you just go well used to be
back page but Craigslist things like

368
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:45,230
that that's where you gonna find the
best majority of it so in looking at the

369
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:49,190
darknet frameworks themselves you can
get somebody on your team to just set up

370
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,970
a couple boxes to be able to get access
to this stuff and you know every now and

371
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:57,080
that you might want to check for like is
we do one of the dumps have your users

372
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,889
information and you want to give them a
heads up to originate that password or

373
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:04,730
something like that
then you don't need to pay out the nose

374
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:09,710
for another third third party vendor you
can do that yourself pretty easily so

375
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:16,130
essentially don't lose sleep over the
dark web I know some CISOs and have

376
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:19,490
you've been doing that you know I've had
people that come come up to me after

377
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:23,299
this talking somebody hey like you know
I had with my C so sit down with me like

378
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,560
show me the dark web right now we need
to know about our threats it's like well

379
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:35,679
first of all I which part equipment but
yeah so and looking at your your risk

380
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,750
framework and your threat modeling and
your resource investment out of fact you

381
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:46,820
really want to take into account just
how much of this content is mundane

382
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:52,510
stuff and how few users are still on the
dark web it's not a whole lot of people

383
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:56,650
that use the internet that you also use
the dark

384
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:01,040
there's the lead to the longer paper
also if you want to slide into my diems

385
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,420
there's my twitter handle and my email
address if you want to add you don't

386
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:11,150
want to ask a question now or something
comes up to you later that were asked

387
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:23,000
about this so now I'm open for questions
yeah it's really useful there is there's

388
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,340
both original works but most of the
music is like people just sharing in the

389
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:36,530
trees there are a couple streaming
services but really because of the lack

390
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:41,570
of so the robustness and the speed of
these most of these frameworks that's

391
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,770
tied directly to the number of users
because they double its nodes as well

392
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:49,970
connection notes you're not going to get
to speak to be able to stream like a

393
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:59,350
video but there are some audio streaming
services oh yes

394
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:42,950
yeah so I mean don't come at it from
your company I eat pool for fun but also

395
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:48,560
what some companies have done to get
around that is they set up a sort of a

396
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,770
third party entity in like the Cayman
Islands or something like that so it's

397
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:58,670
not directly tied to a parent company
and that way they can do their

398
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:02,900
black-budget stuff that way I know
there's a lot of bottom like underground

399
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,770
economy and malware researchers said
they want to be able to buy 0 days and

400
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,620
by malware and things like that
but they don't want to tie back to the

401
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:14,870
company budget so they set up a separate
entity to do that purchasing and that's

402
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:19,009
something you could do for that it would
use like a VPN that's basically serve

403
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:23,380
Europe or something like that
where a jump box from a bulletproof host

404
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:28,790
something like that so it says it pretty
opted who's who's on there and who's

405
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:51,620
coming from where yeah it's really
what's your risk profile for you and for

406
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:56,930
your company and is the type of content
that's going to be on there really worth

407
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:03,259
the investment and I don't know a lot of
vendors that will let our dark web

408
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:07,460
vendors that will answer that like if I
don't know but you could see into the

409
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:11,060
dark web well yeah but you don't have
access to that forums you don't have

410
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,650
access to you know closed groups you're
just doing scraping and keyword searches

411
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,860
like

412
