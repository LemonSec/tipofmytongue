1
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,820
So this talk is on werewolf's, silver
bullets,

2
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,380
vampires, those sort of things. My name is
Wolf Goerlich. I a, two things about me. I

3
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:45,160
recently joined DUO and by recently I
mean like, Monday. So yea DUO! It was really

4
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,309
good. It's like hey, I got a new job and then awesome, welcome aboard. Yeah it's

5
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:51,190
great,  like what are you gonna do? I'm
like well on Thursday and Friday I'm

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,699
going to be out of town. So awesome to be at CypherCon.

7
00:00:54,699 --> 00:01:02,050
Second thing is, second thing is, I drank
holy water. Now, you may hear that, you may

8
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:09,460
go mmm. When he dies he's gonna have a
hard time. But I would say, when I die you

9
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,539
all are really safe, here's why. First of all,
when you drink holy water, you really

10
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,330
shouldn't do this. But if you do it, a
couple key things need to be in place.

11
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,679
One, you need to be out of coffee, that's
important. No coming to uh, come to light

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,440
later why. Two, you need to be not only out
of coffee but it needs to be dark. And it

13
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,690
helps if you store coffee or in holy
water, in separate places but close to

14
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,990
the shelves so that when it's 3:00 in
the morning and you're looking for caffeine,

15
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:40,600
you can mix these things up. Now, if I stole the soundtrack later like that scratching sound, like

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,270
you know when the record skip, how did
get himself into this thing? So today I was, I was

17
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,990
with my boss and they took us to this
like monastery, I think it was close, it was like

18
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,658
Holy Hill.
Holy Hill, it wast Holy Hill. And I was

19
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:55,540
always telling my wife I want holy
water. You don't need holy water.

20
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,520
You don't need holy water.
So you don't need holy water.

21
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,408
So you never know when there's gonna be vampires. She's like you're an idiot. But we ended up

22
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:06,310
there. And we're walking and walking, we
found the place with holy water. And you can have some.

23
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,890
So I wasn't like stealing from the church or anything. So

24
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:13,089
I'm not gonna go to hell yet. But we
only had anything that the captors would

25
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,910
have like a monster.
I love energy drinks. I'm happy about

26
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:21,100
this energy drink bottles and I did and it was great. And fast-forward like six months,

27
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,829
I'm out of coffee, it's 3:00 in the
morning, I'm trying to get work done and

28
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:29,680
runs around, there's some energy bottles
up there. Why don't they have labels? It

29
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,350
doesn't matter why they don't have labels. Since I'm drinking it, I was like halfway through I

30
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,970
remembered and my wife told me I was an idiot.

31
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,260
And then I had holy water (in agony noise). So this is bad, this is really bad. But the good

32
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,649
thing is, the good thing is assuming that
my soul is not lost. If there is a

33
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,690
vampire attack here at CypherCon, I've
got all your backs. I will go to the door,

34
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:57,720
I will hold them off, you guys run, we've
got this people. Holy water's great for

35
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:04,350
vampires right? Yes? So we're good, we're
protected. The problem with cybersecurity

36
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,940
is, you're like I got this thing and it's
solved the problem. And now we go

37
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,510
celebrate and hopefully with coffee or
something stronger than coffee. And the

38
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,380
next thing you know you find out there's
like a bazillion other threats that, that

39
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:24,810
thing doesn't help protect against. And
you're like, But I've got the thing. And you're like, so what bro? So what?

40
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,620
So this talk is about encryption. This talk is about the thing, the holy water. The

41
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,440
Silver Bullet that saves everything and
how to use it and where to apply it and

42
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,250
what to do with it and where it works
and where it doesn't you know it all

43
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,760
starts with the traditional
cybersecurity stuff we need to identify

44
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,040
our assets except for nobody knows what
they have they don't necessarily have a

45
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,019
CMDB and if you caught like didn't catch
Kristen Merkel's talk I'm like I can

46
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,530
push a button and grunted an assent it
is true people push buttons in the live

47
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,910
data centers I worked on cloud security
programs and with great you could push a

48
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,970
button watch this or what assets do you
have just go looking comes whatever

49
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,769
there's what we have not an asset
management program people no problem

50
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:14,959
okay so maybe we know what our assets
are we can then assess the threats

51
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,470
because we all get great threat
intelligence don't we it's like clock

52
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:25,110
against this IP address there is matt
baer who's coming out of Russia

53
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,780
attacking us okay that doesn't help even
but we assess the threats sort of maybe

54
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,650
because kind of we know what that's
coming out of some you don't and then

55
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,169
it's simple from there just protecting
prepped it and that's really the end of

56
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:41,940
the talk there you guys can go home you
can grab lunch everything something and

57
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,760
at least sound simple it always sound
somewhat was never so Ebola and the

58
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,969
problem is - is that encryption is one
of those things

59
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:51,299
that people talk about and I think they
hand and think they're cool everything

60
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:55,049
everything's good so I sit down with the
seats on my page see so what do you have

61
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:58,198
for encryption like we are protecting
other things I'm like that is amazing

62
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,669
Larry yes
we've got HTTPS oh we got BitLocker

63
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:08,849
oh my go buddy we need to have a talk
you can't really put your arm around

64
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:12,889
Omega though your people are telling
you're protecting you're not protected

65
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:17,519
that easy yes it's fantastic it protects
all the attacker traffic break through

66
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:23,369
your back to your website awesome good
job and we know encryption doesn't work

67
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:28,049
right I mean did you make anyone look at
information is beautiful I look at the

68
00:05:28,049 --> 00:05:32,369
great graphs that they have for breach
the other guests haven't you should I'm

69
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:35,309
not gonna show I don't have it what I
recently found out was that they'd I

70
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:38,429
could actually redo the whole website
and the graphic software because there's

71
00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:42,958
so many breaches of breaking their app
like that is fantastic

72
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,129
we are breached so often we are breaking
the cool brass to tell us how awful

73
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:51,599
breach but here's my version of that
slide which is how many records have

74
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:56,998
been stolen from systems that have
encryption pretty much everybody right

75
00:05:56,999 --> 00:06:00,629
and again as you can see it's a little
bit out of date I don't have like anthem

76
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:06,689
or an early 2017 from a team Facebook
the hotel chains everyone else we almost

77
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:10,499
happening all the time the problem is
the encryptions misplaced a

78
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:15,479
misconfigured it's pretty much worth us
right we think we're safe or not and if

79
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:19,169
you're a senior person I guess C so our
CI or whatnot you think hey bro

80
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,948
everything's cool if your junior person
you're like oh you think he's way not

81
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,939
cool but don't tell them that because
I'm not give us more work and then if

82
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:30,329
you're the developer you're like hey you
need to work while your databases weaker

83
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:36,029
get arrested you like are you because do
look anthem have there be innovations

84
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,330
encrypted at rest and does anyone really
steal hard drives

85
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,469
we don't have a data center right so
it's a lot of different debates about

86
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,550
where your future a felon where should
be a what should happen and worse when

87
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,629
the kitchen breaks you get really weird
things like this famous quote from

88
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:56,189
Shakespeare and mrs. Ella Eyre has
occurred and a secure connection the

89
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:58,770
server cannot be needed it was a man
ahead of his time folks

90
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,789
he really was but this is one of those
things that happens when the encryption

91
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:07,979
goes bad then the developers look at you
can go see I told you we should not

92
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:12,150
refer to that and a higher-ups go you
know we will never ever use encryption

93
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,419
product acts ever again if we have
gemalto this would not be a problem

94
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,340
that's picking Jamal to your great
product

95
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,900
dude listen we can get my point whatever
it is if it breaks that product seems

96
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,870
mud for the next foreseeable future and
then it can get even worse if you got

97
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,289
like disk encryption and everyone loses
their hard drives like what happened

98
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:36,029
recently when there's the Microsoft
Update no one get it locker anymore so

99
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:41,189
these can be fine thanks again bro
finally go she goes wrong so those are

100
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:45,020
some of the things in my mind I mean
other thing that's on my mind is

101
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,919
recently I've been like absolutely
obsessed by recent me about a year year

102
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:56,250
having two years now absolutely obsessed
with this concept of going back to

103
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,150
drinking holy water for just a minute
you can look at it as a great security

104
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:06,029
controller it is it is it goes wrong by
me drink up rejected from a person but

105
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:11,129
the good thing is you can look at this
is a great life story of how things go

106
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:13,650
wrong and how to decompress and
decompose

107
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,669
errors and failure modes right whenever
we get hacked yeah decompose what the

108
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:22,560
organization was doing or trying to
protect and what the criminals trying to

109
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,889
do or trying to prevent right you've got
to look at the combination of those two

110
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:30,259
because the motivations the situations
the environments are oftentimes

111
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:35,430
completely different so okay let their
protection prevents and when it

112
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:39,299
oftentimes looks at is like we're
playing the same game with two different

113
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:44,069
boards you got here is our protection is
great protection we've got all the right

114
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,139
pieces
places but then you switch the board

115
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:49,809
around you look at from the attacker
point of view you've got the same piece

116
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:52,600
in the same places but it's a completely
different scenario there's different

117
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,509
gaps just different holes there's
different motivations that the criminals

118
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:58,899
are using the following and what that
means is we end up playing two games

119
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:02,919
simultaneously right me to protect
organization in its ability to do

120
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:07,660
whatever it's doing run stuff do health
care etc or preventing the crime and

121
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,199
what the criminals are trying to do and
all the time trying to stick encryption

122
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:15,608
in the right spot where it makes sense
this is not an easy problem even if you

123
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:19,839
just look at it from technical
perspective it's not an easy problem so

124
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,199
ultimately we did encryption to do both
of those things right protect the

125
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:27,279
organization's ability to machines
mission and active intersection where

126
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,730
the organization generates financial
value or the criminals are financially

127
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,689
motivated to attack this is the Rhino
problem

128
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:39,009
so just guys see in Paris a couple years
ago that all right not sort of got

129
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:43,600
killed the courts horn you want to see
this those in the news I was very

130
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,389
fascinated by that because I'm like why
would you do that hey I want to go to

131
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:51,819
Paris no in the European purse yeah no
okay you have like one of those I was

132
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:54,969
little I was so like I want to be that
guy right doesn't want to be the pair so

133
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,129
I won't eat the good food won't get the
good wine I wanna see the Eiffel Tower

134
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:03,429
it's romantic spider bring my wife she
won't call me an idiot of promise okay

135
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:09,160
so maybe I've got a good maybe out of
that buy but why would they do this I

136
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,069
mean you think like poaching would
happen in Africa or the whole country

137
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,759
the mint money or that they're starving
her on sir stuff why would they do it in

138
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:21,100
Paris so it's looking at this in the
price of the horn at that time was

139
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,419
something like 1.2 million dollars
Thomas Browns price to run more than 1.2

140
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:30,160
million dollars they had that right off
in a fenced enclosure with a little moat

141
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,730
right about this tall offense here's a
good round why the value to them was to

142
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,689
let me permanency the Rhino that's the
value of the organization so the zoo was

143
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:45,969
doing comes around here's our security
control do you think if he gave them 1.2

144
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,780
million
euros there just have a little offense

145
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:57,650
from maybe a gate maybe a wall maybe a
fault maybe a guard when you think about

146
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,819
things from the criminal perspective it
changes the whole way the organization

147
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,320
should think at the same time knowing
both of those areas allows the bounds

148
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,530
were ready to put controls so let's
start protecting the organization and I

149
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:16,520
don't necessarily mean doing an audit
not another audit please mother oh god

150
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:22,120
not another audit when I was a security
officer I used to call this the the

151
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,790
binder about it right the others would
come in and say are you doing the thing

152
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,480
and we would say we are doing the thing
and they'd write a report they're doing

153
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,180
the thing and then come back and go okay
are you doing this thing we're like

154
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,989
we're doing the thing give us proof I'm
like did I say we're doing the thing

155
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,650
we're not really doing the thing not
that one definition and they come back

156
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:43,069
with this binder if you ordered an audit
you see this it's like this heavy they

157
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,260
hit you over the head with it that I
cares all the things you're doing wrong

158
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,400
fix it and they give you this great risk
chart that looks something like this

159
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:57,199
like everything from findings
most of my wrists were blank stare you

160
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,200
stare at them long enough to go away
this is a terrible way to really run a

161
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,370
security program you figure out where to
do encryption a better way is is

162
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,490
leveraging stuff we learned from like
business continuity or code sorry the

163
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:17,900
impact analysis right can we take a look
at what our critical business activities

164
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,819
are what are we really doing with those
things what are the key people in

165
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:28,340
technology what's the value right what
does it all mean so I got a rhino

166
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,750
this rhinos over here the key things of
the Rhino is the people that send to see

167
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,730
the Rhino the
organization is the ticket sales the

168
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,490
controls for the Rhinos that moat in the
fence you get the idea if you think

169
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,880
about it from that perspective we can
start to see what the value that round

170
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:50,260
is to the organization odds have known
your own ticket sales and you can start

171
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,460
gathering some good information about
what this thing really means the

172
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,700
organization so when you're putting a
controlling place on the protect side

173
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:03,640
you can see you can measure it against
what we're trying to accomplish olives

174
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,319
have no darou we will spend quarter
million euro that part of the work

175
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,160
previously my point we can spend
accordingly and interviews are funny

176
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,459
things only do these things you got to
do them very carefully because you get

177
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:22,720
different answers every time I was doing
one in in Chicago it was great the Sun

178
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,870
was rising and my back was the window
which I didn't really think about at the

179
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:32,680
time the windows were open and it was a
blue clear day in Chicago which I think

180
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,439
it's like one day 308 but reliably you
want and so the the one was coming in

181
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,710
was lotteries teams coming in they're
sitting in front of me and I'm just

182
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:46,330
sitting down I'm looking it down and the
lights shining behind their eyes and I'm

183
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:53,890
like tell me all your problems what have
you done to our organization and it

184
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,100
didn't realize like so like 10 minutes
into the art in the interview that goes

185
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,930
like a scene from a mafia movie like
this is fantastic I just need like a

186
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:10,599
soundtrack and the cat I can rub I did
ask for a cap on it but but we do these

187
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,360
interviews you have to go through it a
couple different times so I was going to

188
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,480
get different answers or the person
sitting other feeling do they know

189
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,260
what's going on not it works does it
work really yes let me talk to someone

190
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,130
else does it work does what work we've
ever had that my fare was asking

191
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,660
someone's they had a fire I appliance
this absolutely we do we play the odds

192
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,740
and maintenance it's very secure I'm
like that's fantastic I talk to now

193
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,119
engineer Devo fire our clients
yeah it doesn't like don't tell the boss

194
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:42,829
folks I'm going to spend the money
somewhere else so out of this of these

195
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:45,738
business impact analysis you come up
with a great design that looks something

196
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:49,790
like this right you guys probably sees
diagrams here's our key people here's

197
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,480
our key technologies here's a key so
this is the castle we're ultimately

198
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,470
trying to defend against the vampires
the werewolves here it is folks

199
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:02,779
and using BC berp announce system and
BIA analysis will allow you to get there

200
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:05,989
now once you're there you're like okay
that's awesome but it doesn't really

201
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:09,949
tell me where I should apply encryption
tells me that it should it tells me how

202
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:15,199
much money I should spend that man tells
me that people would be involved but

203
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,998
where do I feel like the way to get to
that is doing data flow analysis right

204
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:27,049
you go ahead and you say document the
process develop the IT systems and

205
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:31,850
diagrams then if I what we're trying to
do this is like PCI DSS and hip up has

206
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,290
ever done those when the person daughter
says give us your data flow diagram so

207
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:43,009
most people go and then they down but
for those that don't fail and have it

208
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:47,299
this is what you're looking at it's
taking that business process down one

209
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:52,459
level you see all the time in healthcare
you see it all the time and HIPAA and

210
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:56,089
both of these are fantastic it's not
when I started looking at the castle

211
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:59,299
return to defend we're looking at what
people are doing within that castle

212
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:03,379
right we're looking at the stagecoach
that's driving up to the castle and how

213
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,739
we're going to protect that theater
coming in and out an example one might

214
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:10,399
look something like this we've got a
shopping cart system we got our online

215
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,089
big clients web clients are going
through firewalls we're getting this

216
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:18,350
great proxy but a great proxy allows us
to connect backs our databases my web

217
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,160
servers and there's another firewall
velocity for key systems and internal

218
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,249
right you can map out at a high level of
it data flows across and then you can

219
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:30,799
actually look at the controls which I'm
not going to bore any of you guys with

220
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,220
but you can do a control assessment just
on that data flow which is also

221
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,619
important because when you're doing
these interviews are like do you have

222
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:44,029
any picture they're like yes we did
you're like awesome where everywhere we

223
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:48,529
promise if you ever done these
assessments even if you're not doing the

224
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,730
whole Mafia thing tell me where you are
what you know because I know what you

225
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,209
know a big Tommy get will miss you even
if you're not doing that and you're just

226
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:58,969
like hey what the choice do you have
they're like we're galaxy MVP that's

227
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,610
awesome
we've got Asset Management's also we got

228
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:07,250
an MDM it's awesome that's fantastic
how many asses to have on a management

229
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,329
we've got a thousand that's fantastic
what if I told you at need thousand

230
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:18,800
devices in your environment thank you
yeah but we got those controls in place

231
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,000
don't worry for the thousand that we're
controlling it's really good 60% of the

232
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,010
time works all the time it's fantastic
so well you're go ahead doing that ID

233
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,850
system and I'm pros adjust to those
areas which allow us to actually get a

234
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,370
little bit more grain you know it allows
us to get closer to where we need to put

235
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,330
the scaredy allows us to get closer to
the truth right so luckily encouraged

236
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:43,750
from the right layers from a protection
perspective so the key takeaway this is

237
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:50,030
encryptions effectiveness is really only
specific to the layer in the stakeholder

238
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,660
right the stakeholder who's trying to
protect your data and what they're doing

239
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,530
with it and the layer in which it
happens TLS is not going to affect you

240
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:02,000
if you're trying to protect your patient
data in the database for example just

241
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,350
driving encryption that can affect you
if you've encrypted all of s3 buckets

242
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,550
which is a fantastic unit shards are all
great and you've got a old day your

243
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:16,280
website and you don't have a wife for
example from there though you can also

244
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,570
start digging in deeper in Korean very
specific controls around encryption I've

245
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,950
got an 8 point control set I can share
with you guys you wanna drop me an email

246
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,510
it's pretty open but it looks something
like this we look to the network traffic

247
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:33,850
number one we look at I should actually
know this so I'm going to sit down and

248
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:39,230
been a while so a few slides we look at
the active data right are the data and

249
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,420
files actually encrypted if I'm
submitting a whole bunch of thousand are

250
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:48,210
they erected and protected appropriately
we look at the data at rest that there

251
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,320
we look at things like purchased and
developed applications are they

252
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,159
protecting data appropriately as we're
going to third parties think about

253
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,660
supply chain attacks we look at our
databases we look at encryption keys and

254
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,980
certificates whether or not they're
protected I had a great one of the first

255
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:11,940
instant response systems I ever worked
on or problems I've worked on that we've

256
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,360
been breached because it's terrible it's
okay we've got a whack well good

257
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,620
but we think it was down okay yeah yeah
but all our files are encrypted okay

258
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,600
good and they all are also encrypted on
the transport layer but that's not to be

259
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,679
good and how do they encourage it in the
system with gpg good so file encryption

260
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,950
and on our partner schemes of excellent
like okay good

261
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:36,500
so we're all set like yeah we have the
keys on the server if you need them

262
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:43,860
again record scratch wait you say what
the the guys have been compromised by

263
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,830
Russian attackers they found that when
they went to patch because the past not

264
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,550
apply because of Russian language files
aren't there so they came up and a

265
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,280
vulnerability management protocol by the
way pay attention servers you don't have

266
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,960
Russian language about patch what so it
came in the investigated they were

267
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,160
completely compromised the Russians of
the back door had customized their own

268
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,480
keyboards it was great Russians were
very happy very very very happy to sirs

269
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,730
and they have all the keys to the
kingdom

270
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,020
I'm a keychain I'm the server under this
root which is also where Pesci was

271
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,670
running game over that's a good so we
have to look at hey are you protecting

272
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:22,740
keys are you protecting authentication
authorization are you doing multi-factor

273
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,420
right if you're doing a federated
identity with ping or OAuth is that set

274
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,170
up properly so you're protecting those
user drugs because obviously if we

275
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:36,120
didn't short-circuit that attack surface
a lot of the problems go away especially

276
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,040
with the tech we use everything else and
then finally give an entire program that

277
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,330
maintains all this overtime get out of
these central place what happens

278
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,110
tomorrow next week next month when
things are changing especially DevOps

279
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:53,340
environment
so those that eat make drivers we look

280
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:58,620
at when we assess from hey here's a
castle here's our process this is our

281
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,739
way I'm running up the chain here's our
technology enables all of it and then we

282
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:07,500
go through and look at these eight areas
of each one these controls one make sure

283
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:16,080
hey are you doing the thing is there a
standard is it written down and also are

284
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,340
you ensuring that it's maintained then
people know about it and what have you

285
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,330
because with staff turnover you don't
know what the like average time is that

286
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:30,300
people spend on the company these days
is it like six months is a year it's not

287
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,050
very long
no those were like I'm gonna tell you

288
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,450
I've been I'm a company for the
appropriate amount of time if you're

289
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:41,400
hiring by the way talk to me people jump
around a lot right

290
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,780
and so we jump from company to company
often times these things aren't in the

291
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,379
training aren't provided we finally
they've got great controls and six

292
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,590
months later someone else is doing it
those controls are long or retained or

293
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:58,939
they've been neglected etc etc so have
the thing do the thing check the thing

294
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,210
the next point is that curtains things
don't age well this is back to why we

295
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,060
need a program
what's things we said today are great

296
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,460
for today probably not be great for
tomorrow

297
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,260
just what every conference has some way
of breaking some technology like some

298
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,340
point in time and I think like BitLocker
it seems like every six months they're

299
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,090
like don't use BitLocker it's been
breached like okay wait Excel recent

300
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:26,340
patch break everything we'll put it back
on but it is very clear if you take

301
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,490
something that gets us out that these
things you know in a few years you got a

302
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,250
row together like a different cipher
together mean team and look at different

303
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,570
ways of putting it on and so it's got to
be a living security program this

304
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:43,500
encryption program desk right and back
to the assessment of those sort of

305
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,330
things disk inspector of saying about
asking people right when you ask me what

306
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,510
your security is you're not really
measuring their security and so many of

307
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:55,050
assessments and audits use that okay
coming over to interview

308
00:22:55,050 --> 00:23:02,070
awesome come on in so be great put on
some lights yeah fantastic but what are

309
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,379
they what these assessments are
measuring we think about spilling right

310
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,100
the feeling of how secure they are and
there's always that deeper reality and

311
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,389
we need to get past what we feel to
actually doing the testing and making

312
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,710
sure what isn't a deeper reality those
are often the control tastico

313
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,340
validations a you see again encryption
let's test that stuff of traffic just

314
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,090
take a look let's make sure it's sample
them the machines are doing BitLocker

315
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,959
those sort of things
all right so protecting the business

316
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,910
want identify critical activities - do
that data flow we want to make sure that

317
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,850
we know what technology supports and
then apply those specific controls that

318
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:40,439
covered that's what the tech side I was
talking about looking at from the

319
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,740
criminal side that criminals were going
to rush up here jump them out jump

320
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,360
thanks killer in a run off the horn and
make off the million euros that's the

321
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,090
prevent side we oftentimes hear about
all these scary things that security

322
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,520
people need to be worried about
well after them say about you know

323
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,620
security people should be up all night
because they only need to be right once

324
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,739
but you need to be right every single
time or every always hear about these

325
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,300
sort of things whereas here about
nation-state actors are out to get us

326
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:13,169
those sort of things and I think it
really matters just like when we're

327
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:17,430
teasing a part of an organization to see
what the technology isn't what

328
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,850
stakeholders are and what they're doing
that we have some tease apart the

329
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:26,219
threats to get similar insights and some
ideas so you're like things like naming

330
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,740
the monster it's like we've got a
description its rightful owner anchors

331
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,000
the curiosity goes over the
stereotypical hackers it's weird that

332
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,690
many of us are not nostalgic for the
ecotripping curiosity lone actors but it

333
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,880
is the case so you take those monsters
you look at instead of threats right the

334
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,080
lone actors driven by revenge they
didn't pay me right I shall take them

335
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,490
down
ask me not joining your company and

336
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,000
foreign companies saying we will pay you
X amount of money to install a backdoor

337
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,010
or steal data from us closer to things

338
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,480
activist group actors right the people
driven by cause anonymous I was

339
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,340
mentioning earlier before I got in stage
that I'm Monday I'll sit down with a

340
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,300
bunch of folks and I was by far there
was one I think most is more like half

341
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:20,330
my age where Gavin around but okay can
you tell us about scary in the old days

342
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:30,600
yeah yes do me like floppy drives what
no like anonymous like 2010 was the old

343
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:39,030
days thanks thanks I would tell you
about those we wrote dinosaurs I greatly

344
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:44,300
bought off anonymous with median the
Legion

345
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,149
so yeah activist but there's stuff that
we still know that they're going after

346
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:53,640
companies and everything else cyber
criminals the organized crime waves that

347
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,810
are all over the place the gangs by the
way and getting back to Chris Marcus our

348
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:02,879
flight just left I love toys like here's
a great DevOps case study next slide and

349
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,490
by the way they're criminals yet a point
about how it is the only difference

350
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:13,740
between infection rate and release rate
is how happier DevOps manager is like

351
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,760
that's fantastic so if you didn't see
that check on the video bye alright so

352
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,820
cyber crime was known impersonation
state which is what most of us are most

353
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,909
freaked out about because we're always
hearing about China and Russia and

354
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:28,410
everyone else during the attacks so if
you take a minute and we map the

355
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,760
business we understand what we have and
what's in the way and what it's worth

356
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,520
and how much we get to the cast so who
wants to get to the castle we can then

357
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,090
start figuring out what is the real
danger these threats and these debts are

358
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,810
a little bit old but I still think that
are very relevant guaranteeing a couple

359
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:47,760
percentages for what we're facing and it
starts up something that's nation-state

360
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,450
would most people hear about with most
no concern about it's only about 4% of

361
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:59,690
breaches when I was getting this data
insider threat or espionage another 4%

362
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:04,140
hacktivists 11% pretty interesting I
would have thought they would have been

363
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,710
small under their law
because there's a lot of them and the

364
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,820
rest of it is on sever ground it's
almost all cybercrime

365
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,720
so do you think about a prioritization
right like the the old proto principle

366
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,630
oh yeah you know you put some of the
results coming for some effort but we

367
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:23,250
can just attack off cyber crime
imagine how fewer threats we have and

368
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:27,870
how fewer things we have to face which
is again where I ii think encryption is

369
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,830
incredibly important with these things
but this is what this is what we're

370
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:37,230
looking at right this is this is the
scary night in which we operate under so

371
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,430
when we start focusing in on what
controls to put where we can look at you

372
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,580
know where the organization Center is
value which I covered earlier we also do

373
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,520
to look at where criminals are
financially motivated what is making

374
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,080
them go after us what are they really
trying to get obvious as things like

375
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,340
credit cards which are now only like ten
dollars I feel kind of bad for the cyber

376
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,810
criminals it used to be so much you
should be like make 150 $200 off credit

377
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:08,220
cards but then it crashed crashed right
around like 20 centers so because

378
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,080
because and this also makes me throw
wrote bad about cybersecurity because so

379
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,860
many credit cards are stolen like
targets now that happened that people

380
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,429
are like oh credit cards are no longer
worth that much we could there's a glut

381
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:26,100
of the market so spline demand is work
you mean crime genre ten bucks

382
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,919
first my Dendi is now we're twenty bucks
used to again be several hundred dollars

383
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:37,020
Thank You anthem for driving down the
market personal health information about

384
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:43,020
$60 so why this is important if you know
the area of business you're looking at

385
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,110
and the information within those
databases and information with those

386
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:50,760
files you can do some simple math x
number of records by something we

387
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,040
doesn't these numbers change all the
time you can find you know threat

388
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,610
reports that gives it I could number but
you can time somebody's number and you

389
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,889
can say my rhino horn is worth a million
and a half euros you can talk to that

390
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,560
about the people are like no but we only
want a little moment events because

391
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,629
everyone wants to see it you're yes I
know it's a beautiful ring a million and

392
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,100
a half euros right you can do that math
and you can start to open up a lot of

393
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:19,620
eyes and then you can start doing some
threat assessments right what did the

394
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,580
criminals gonna do how they gonna get
there and what's going to look like and

395
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,449
you can start using some good friend
colleges it's not the whole like here's

396
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:32,070
an IP address here's the name of the the
new nation-state hacker group here's a

397
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,509
new cool of name of a et group but what
are the likely actors hey right now

398
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:39,840
we're talking criminals one of the
likely assets or target credit cards

399
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,928
whatever maybe what are the
vulnerabilities now we look at those

400
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:46,710
systems waiting back early when talking
about protecting we look at those

401
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,009
systems to say okay what are the bombs
the the anchor points they're criminals

402
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:52,860
when we used to cross through those
systems to get to those resources

403
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,119
what's the path or anything I know we
can filter all of the intelligence all

404
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:00,269
the fur intelligence all over the world
that gives to us which will bury any

405
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:03,929
team anytime you turn read at all you
can filter it all just by those

406
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:07,649
connections down the things you actually
need to worry about me concerned about

407
00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:12,928
and then your world becomes a lot a lot
simpler and you can then go ahead and do

408
00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:15,869
some threat bombing because every day
take that threat that we've got some

409
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:19,799
stats on but we know how likely it is
there's another life cycle around I'll

410
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:22,529
show what that looks like in a minute
let's identify things this thing

411
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,039
controls we have what what detective
what what preventive will get the way of

412
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:31,379
it and let's go ahead and design some
specific threat specific encryption use

413
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:36,209
cases out of that very specific very
point solutions to go ahead and dress

414
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:40,230
just a threat you do that enough it's
something strategically what the county

415
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:44,490
themes are and there's another one ways
to threat model there's a million one

416
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,269
ways to do it I had to just take it was
a very simple whiteboard and just draw

417
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:52,230
it out right here's what we have we're
trying to protect they're our friends

418
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,169
and family we're trying to protect their
way in there trying to figure castle

419
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:59,309
this is the patented van hosing
throughout my own case you guys are it's

420
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:04,039
not really bad if you stay alright but
all right so we've got our monsters and

421
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:08,369
obviously drag Club really doesn't care
about anything else I'm castle but the

422
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:11,999
werewolves want everything else so we
can start layout for us white border

423
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:14,879
cross here's what they're going TAC
here's what we're gonna go through and

424
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:19,740
then we can start say okay what type of
things will stop them you know we've got

425
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,700
our get our holy water we got our
bullets we got an amount

426
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:28,789
we got our walls these are threats these
are controls these are assets very very

427
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:32,389
high level it's a great table top
conversation to say okay to start

428
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:37,008
mapping these things I'm talking about
what has the most stopping power what is

429
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:42,409
going to prevent us from going where I'm
starting to say really my my holy water

430
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:47,450
does not seem to be very effective I
guess don't hide behind me but you can

431
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:51,289
still buy me a drink in a bar you can
start laying these things out and having

432
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:54,200
some great conversations with folks
about where you need to invest and where

433
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,259
you don't and what would work and what
wouldn't now practically speaking when

434
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:03,230
you go to the next level you're gonna
want to document the screen alone right

435
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:07,279
up the tak path there's a lot of
conversations we've had about this you

436
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,669
can hit my YouTube channel to see whole
videos about how to do this we can lay

437
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:14,059
out all the steps are going to take
right across a consistent kill chain or

438
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:18,379
attack mitre framework or whatever types
are going to say you can lock that out

439
00:32:18,379 --> 00:32:21,949
and then do a Sankey diagram which looks
very similar to the earlier diagram I

440
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:26,059
displayed but a little more complicated
say here's our threats here's our

441
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:31,039
defenses here's the assets and you can
follow through and see what asset or

442
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,908
what controls have the most fat the part
where you need to invest where you need

443
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:40,820
to focus in that right and this gets to
another point and I just touched that

444
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,029
I'm just barely but I think it's
important to really pull it out but not

445
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:48,049
specific threat intelligence it's not
intelligence it's just noise we're

446
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,379
getting too much stuff coming at you and
it doesn't match your business and it

447
00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:55,158
doesn't matter the criminals are going
to attack and it doesn't matter to the

448
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:57,470
bonobos you have it's not necessary
threat intelligence

449
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,619
great information great fodder let's
have a good conversation about it maybe

450
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:04,639
but there's just so much other yeah I
think it's absolutely paramount that's

451
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:10,119
got a good filtering mechanism to get up
through all that sort of stuff

452
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:14,720
alright so specific intelligence needs
to specific examples right we know that

453
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,009
like for example hygiene will reduce the
harm so if you're patching you do sort

454
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:22,460
of things over just a lot of accidental
we can reduce the

455
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:26,000
services to sway the casual attackers
and script kiddies the Longboat

456
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,660
assessments and looking what's out there
and what could happen we could reduce

457
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:35,270
the lure right what is attracting the
criminals it's also something we don't

458
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,120
often times think about with the whole
like traditional risk assessment

459
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,020
approach but if criminals don't know
what you can but less like their attack

460
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,260
you if they're the dedicated criminals
who are going after and I'm talking

461
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,920
about the people are scamming us every
day at night that goes back to reducing

462
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,100
the attack service but you can start
plotting out different strategies to

463
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:59,419
attack and go after different types of
threat categories and then of course you

464
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,780
put encryption place would now earlier I
said from the protects that encryption

465
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:07,850
is layers for certain stakeholders over
the tank side encryptions effectiveness

466
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:14,239
is right specific what exact our we
stopping what exact front so redress and

467
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,709
why in what amount of money are they
gonna make out of it will drive

468
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:24,020
conversation about what amount of money
we should spend I'm correcting it right

469
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,960
and once we get there now we can finally
talk about encrypting a lot of people

470
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,440
jump right to the step we have data we
must secret we've got security

471
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,159
compliance programs we must have crypt
leaving out all of that conversation

472
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,009
what we're trying to protect all the
conversation what we're trying to

473
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,760
prevent most people want to jump right
to your why just the sexy stuff you want

474
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,880
to know hey what global
encryption how are you running how are

475
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,150
you doing your cue rotation right those
are the fun conversations you want to

476
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:50,360
have now let me tell you about our
business and what our revenue targets

477
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,660
are and everyone in the bar goes off so
you stop wolf there's a door over there

478
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:00,740
no I need to jump right into that now D
so when you do that you can start doing

479
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,149
some encryption so here's a couple case
studies in this particular case like

480
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:09,290
what we did was in this flow we found
that we've got medical personnel the

481
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:13,310
wrong in all over the place there's a
personal laptops that's always a problem

482
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,630
they're going into this remote desktop
on the connection to the work computer

483
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,690
to get into some stuff from there
they're in the EMR they don't ask the

484
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:26,000
files and this was an overall data flow
map that we got it over several days was

485
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,990
getting interesting about this so
microphones are sorry down below you can

486
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:36,779
see like yellow is someone encrypted red
is not encrypted and blue is is accepted

487
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,670
for data in motion and the keys are red
I mean cryptid for the locks it's not

488
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:47,250
blue encrypted at rest it is okay make
sense so what was going to extreme about

489
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:52,890
this is we're having this conversation
and we're talking to the sea so alright

490
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:58,470
so your portal that people are using to
log into this that station yes

491
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:07,830
absolutely awesome good yes so we will
mark that oh wait right this perspective

492
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,160
that earlier conversation on having
assessments about a feeling you're

493
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,980
feeling is encrypted
I think someone told me it seemed a

494
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,250
cryptid so what happens if someone types
in HTTP and all I'm doing though

495
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:21,210
well what happens if they did I don't
know we tried it HTTP works right away

496
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,060
no big deal
we're in it's unencrypted like maybe

497
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,350
they do some you never color it's like I
will fix this speakerphone thousands of

498
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,940
them the i-team in turn we've got a
problem

499
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:36,810
eventually okay sure let's fix this in a
few minutes people in there submit a

500
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:41,609
ticket no problem abundant so we got
this problem

501
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:46,590
people are telling H you can type HTTP
to read support them long pregnant pause

502
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:51,450
and I swear I could almost hear the
helpdesk icon all right fine you could

503
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,529
say it goes well yeah of course there
what even in verse there well that's how

504
00:36:55,530 --> 00:37:00,750
we train them to do that light yes and
then I didn't hear the rest of

505
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:07,109
conversations I pick up the phone but if
you a train the IT manager had trained

506
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:10,529
everyone and even sent up a little
helpful cards the roaming medical

507
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,080
profession on the personal laptops
here's something into the portal of

508
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,759
typing HDTV bubble pop whereas security
professionals and I renounce what we're

509
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,970
great we got the latest version of TLS
no no can't test it right get tested

510
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:28,350
so that was one area weakness we had
Empire another thing is the data

511
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:33,630
warehouse no multi-factor authentication
the EMR did have on track

512
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,830
that's good you know did that's goes
over like a this is true that data

513
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:42,350
warehouse have two factor authentication
well it'd be a little bit harder okay

514
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:47,730
was intended or else our patient records
okay on how many patient records again

515
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:53,160
Mac multi patient records by voters to
Moses told here's your rhino horn it's

516
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,310
just more really good because I can feel
like we can do multi-factor

517
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:02,340
authentication they can be good good
awesome so you can start having some

518
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,360
good conversations around a very simple
diagram like this where it would be

519
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:12,600
otherwise lost in the weeds if that
makes sense with that we can do that

520
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:19,230
awesome diagram here they wanted to do
stride so we're looking the threats we

521
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,440
map devoted to different protections you
correctly network traffic I mentioned

522
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,670
that already fix the identification and
multi-factor and you can start to see

523
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:30,060
where most your stopping power is to get
to those assets they healthcare and

524
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,660
racially crowd to the infrastructure
make sense so we're able to then use

525
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:40,759
that as a diagram to explain where
implement these new security controls so

526
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,890
here we found some health information
was encrypted

527
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:48,810
we found some passwords or we in the net
multi-factor authentication we ran that

528
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:52,680
those eight point controls I mentioned
earlier we've made a great spider

529
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,509
diagram doesn't like a spider diagram
every presentation of spider

530
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:02,790
security is built around spider diagrams
and then we went ahead and built that

531
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:06,230
business case for them to go ahead and
raw those additional security controls

532
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:10,170
that was how we did know it was a layer
of abstraction allow us to have some

533
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:14,730
really great conversations to move the
ball forward another example on the

534
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:21,600
payment side looks something like this
the folks had again personal laptop

535
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,400
sometimes
laptops is fantastic there could be no

536
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,359
website and this is a traditional model
it's only encrypted the endpoint and

537
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:31,029
everything was I'm hurt because you guys
remember back in the day I don't mean

538
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:35,500
back in the day like 2010 folks I mean
like back in the day where a person was

539
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,550
like overhead and slowed things down so
I'll make these great diagrams and

540
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:43,300
design models or it only occurred to the
edge yeah they bought it they built it

541
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:48,700
so it was unencrypted through everywhere
else and then the people go to the

542
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,000
website the website with the car donor
data that will go to a payment service

543
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,950
portal to push the payment processor
back in Florida the past ie the payment

544
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,460
processor would send the off codes into
this data warehouse and that will go

545
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,760
ahead and pass information is being paid
or not paid what was interesting about

546
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,380
this is immediately we're just off that
medical owner like look at it or else

547
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:12,220
this is why it's so important to
actually dig deeper because in this

548
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,549
environment there's actually no
information worth stealing the data

549
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,670
where else at all and they spend a lot
of time already thinking we need to

550
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:22,900
secure the data warehouse yeah we do and
we're looking like but it's got

551
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:29,560
transaction codes and user names but no
passwords or card data like it's a thief

552
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,290
I'd be really bummed if I spend a whole
bunch of time trying to steal this data

553
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:38,529
where else like man I got gypped so we
didn't necessarily focus there we did

554
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:43,270
focus a lot on the transaction data
itself over the network especially since

555
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:47,320
this was an environment that was
cloud when use cloud air quotes was

556
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,099
actually hosted environment not
necessarily ashore when I was when these

557
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:55,420
IT infrastructure providers and it was
running across other environments and

558
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,300
there's a whole bunch of complications
so I think you know that you would wanna

559
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,080
watch there you want to watch some of
the data on the website but then the

560
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,730
back then probably not so much
so we map this out there because of some

561
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,490
of the things we looked at in correcting
that active data as was moving through

562
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:14,618
the environment cooking the credit cards
once those accepted protecting that data

563
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:18,430
in the apps and then we're also looking
at some spoofing some key management

564
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,700
because they really wanted to get very
specific in their key management

565
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:26,500
handling so this particular one we went
ahead

566
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,820
and the mapping as you can see most of
the concerns were around those

567
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,360
applications the databases we use that
to build the business case we actually

568
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,980
ultimately move them to tokenization
we're recruiting than credit card even

569
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:42,220
at a very high level and keeping an
encrypted token throughout the entire

570
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:48,850
system which does bring up a good point
tokens are pretty damn cool promises a

571
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:52,330
lot of times we want and every day
that's useful it's helpful pass around

572
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:58,600
if he's good but but once it's stolen
obviously that things happen so how do

573
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,880
you have the same token or same ID
there's you can process it it's actually

574
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,940
recording with everything else but still
be able to move it throughout the whole

575
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:11,080
system and on what I see a lot of
monitor system doing is we decide the of

576
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,740
encrypted everywhere encrypted
immediately the minute the moves inside

577
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,370
the system this is the exact opposite
the old design pattern where you would

578
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:21,940
have it only occur to the Internet but
we all trust our environment right this

579
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:27,010
is the the encryption version of zero
trust the data moves in its immediately

580
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:31,000
encrypted it's only decrypted if someone
needs to use it your way you do that of

581
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,700
course by using some of these api's that
they do the decrypt but but predominant

582
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:42,370
mover through the entire system and the
decrypted State so for example three we

583
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:47,560
had this distributed site we looked at a
lot of different things here the event

584
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,009
of back Pinero's windows they have
single sign-on server we were concerned

585
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:54,820
about there's this corporate network the
different trust zones the web crime

586
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,360
reporting all that had multi-factor
authentication except the API

587
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,470
interesting link so we had to fix that
and that never happens all right you

588
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:06,279
never have like oh we've got an entire
environment configured with multi-factor

589
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,390
but we forgot one little thing no
company would ever make that mistake

590
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:15,640
like Microsoft with office a year and a
half ago okay I'll let you guys see that

591
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,870
they actually didn't have multi-factor
than that Outlook Web Access API so you

592
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:24,520
grab a token there and ask the Home
Guard officers fixed bias pretty snazzy

593
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,810
so they've got Mon factor there we're
looking at the web

594
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:33,340
certification service and the way that
this was ultimately architect was so

595
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:36,310
that when the data was processed by the
witness mine at the web pine or anywhere

596
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:39,640
on there it would be encrypted
no stay encrypted throughout all these

597
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,170
tiers and we started her to the database
we start encrypting the data warehouse

598
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:48,190
it's a token and that became the key
that everything else was run off of and

599
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:52,150
it was only the correct if someone
needed to use it and had a building to

600
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:55,000
use it so if he needed a credit card
they needed to take a look at that

601
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,220
credit card you click the button yeah
show me the credit card

602
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:02,910
that would actually instantiate the
decryption action that make sense

603
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:08,170
so that is the threat while there I'm
looking at my clock we got four minutes

604
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:13,810
so I'm going to zoom through a few
slides here so at the end of the day I

605
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:18,340
mean all controls make better criminals
the better things get the more likely

606
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,160
the attackers are going to move up the
stack and find new and better ways to

607
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:28,270
attack which is why things like key
management becomes so important and I

608
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:33,400
would see without key management system
corruption right it means if you don't

609
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,980
have those keys protects not even
purchase just encoding so as we start to

610
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,540
look at the XIT systems and figure out
where to do the encryption you can get

611
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:48,310
the more technical diagrams get more
deep into it you can look at things such

612
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:54,070
as application layer encryption where
you're actually doing the encryption

613
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:58,480
using something like an API or you can
look at format Missouri Krypton when we

614
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,660
do in picked everywhere I actually
prefer form a encryption preserving

615
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,740
phishing presenter can flow the legacy
systems like mainframes god forbid use

616
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:09,580
that mainframes with offense it do so it
can flow through and all you're saying

617
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:15,910
reporting would work and at the end of
the day with that very complex system we

618
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:19,540
had a threat model of something like
this and were able to show a nice layer

619
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:24,220
where the encryption was and why it was
from the protect side we were to show to

620
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:30,700
the threat specific version where it
wasn't why was in the prevent side so

621
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,540
next steps if you want to do something
like this obviously we want to protect

622
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:37,810
this organization instability to its
mission how by an employee some

623
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:41,810
encryption strategically making sure
where the encryption is placed is

624
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:46,279
the business processes trying to protect
back to my Rhino example making sure it

625
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,690
protects that level and making sure that
takes into account where threats are

626
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:55,250
actually trying to do and being so aware
that the media often times is hyping up

627
00:45:55,250 --> 00:46:01,670
threats that are unique and interesting
but also unlikely especially unlikely

628
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:06,170
before a lot of the organizations that
were working with when you do that and

629
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:09,590
you take this approach you can work from
the bottom up starting with the

630
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:12,860
traditional IT diagram so here's the
environment we have news we're trying to

631
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,460
protect moving up to data flow diagrams
here's how the deal is flowing through

632
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:20,270
the networking what needs to be again
this relies heavily on what we've done

633
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:24,050
four years of the PCI HIPAA domain and
then going to the business side of

634
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:30,200
looking at the business process from
there doing very simple threat modeling

635
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,399
I love tabletops of others sit down with
organizations and people from all across

636
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,270
the business and ask them what controls
they have the answer is always fantastic

637
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:42,620
do you have that control up so they have
that control so as the CIO the seaso is

638
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:46,819
doing C so yeah if I can try absolutely
we've got that bobbing Network easy Bob

639
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,720
do you have that uh-huh
what what no I don't think we do I think

640
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:56,209
that's out desk has to have this no bro
we people that a long time ago so these

641
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:59,420
sensitivities are always in sizeable you
get everyone in the room and you have

642
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,570
that conversation your whiteboarding and
you're talking at a higher level you're

643
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:05,480
gonna have time to get engaged and have
those conversations and move the ball

644
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,860
for in a significant way next steps
you're gonna do this gonna build a

645
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:13,790
program like this it looks something
like this next week you know identify

646
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:18,110
your business activities and the threats
in the first three months figure out

647
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:23,120
what's critical identify those data
flows map that enabling infrastructure

648
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:28,100
build those controls do some of those
threat modeling again folks just how

649
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:33,259
much critical I was working with that
hospital and they have like 18 systems

650
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:36,740
and business flows and everything like
you know we're gonna focus your health

651
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,220
information this one's good where'd your
payment bridge that one good let's start

652
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:43,759
there so talking and targeting in the
critical ones for the first three months

653
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,700
and on the six months building up a
habit and

654
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:51,799
to do this again again with nature's
building an actual program that protects

655
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:57,050
the businesses and prevents the threats
I have zero time for questions I'm sorry

656
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:03,619
kitchen ramp doors in conclusion key
takeaways key takeaway one if you're

657
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:10,490
going to start holy water clearly
labeled body clearly labeled Bob very

658
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:14,540
important pro tip do not make something
that can't be so I'm not sure what that

659
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:21,320
means wrestled other important points
for foreign threat modeling there's so

660
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,800
many good resources out there to do it's
so easy these days and it's a great

661
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,400
starting point a high threat specific
encryption not encryption or every way

662
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,540
about what is the actual threat we're
trying to stop with this encryption how

663
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:37,910
likely is it to occur what trying to do
apply data centric encryption where's

664
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:41,118
the data we're trying to protect was it
mean organization and how we're

665
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,390
conducting on that layer and build an
overall program that allows you to do

666
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:47,960
that again and again and again
have you some great conversations about

667
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,720
the threats having some great
conversations about the business but

668
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,939
ultimately looking for better ways to
secure things with that thank you so

669
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:00,939
much for spending on so the guys are
appreciate it

670
00:49:52,049 --> 00:49:59,770
you
