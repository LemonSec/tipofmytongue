1
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,560
My name is Edd Black. I've been doing
institutional defense and wonder for

2
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,390
companies throughout the Midwest for over ten years at this point. I'm on Twitter, I also blog when my workplace

3
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:39,739
allows me to do so. This talk was born out of frustration of dealing with offenders. What

4
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,519
we'll talk about is skilled persistent
threat. Everybody's heard of

5
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,410
an APT. And then every heard of a
script read. As if there's nothing in

6
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,519
between that you need to worry about to
defend efforts. Oh, we are going to

7
00:00:52,520 --> 00:01:00,800
clarify that over the course of this talk. So
why? There's a classic idea that we fear

8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,539
what we don't understand. And left to
devices especially in securities we're

9
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,860
dealing with leadership and governance
anybody else involved that fear will run

10
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:15,800
rampant. Now a lot of this is we have
adversaries that always come up when you

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,850
talk to a vendor, that you have, you know
from the matrix that it's going to be hacker that

12
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,119
we're from anywhere on planet earth, steal all of your data and if you don't

13
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,569
have our product, there's absolutely
nothing you can do about it because he

14
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:33,890
will always be better than you. At some
point, even the adversary has to start at

15
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,539
the beginning with no skill-set. That skill-set does not just suddenly turn on one

16
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,789
day like their a sleeper agent who's been
activated.

17
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:45,679
It grows over time. And as adversaries
will tend to continue to go after the

18
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:50,360
same targets as persistent, you can
track the information gained through

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,190
laws from their attacks against or
infrastructure, to then build their life

20
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,300
cycle and see their learning curve and
when they have figured out, what

21
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,869
different processes to increase their
capabilities and tool sets. And

22
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:04,970
understandably, this empowers the
defender.

23
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,318
They don't, at one point we've all heard the
bad guy who only has to be right once to

24
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:13,190
get in your network. Well the goal is to
make sure they have to be right a lot of

25
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:18,630
times once so they get their foot in the door. Plus I've said

26
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,340
there's more than script kiddies on
the one side who graduate into APTs.

27
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,230
There's this concept that if you're
dealing with the Chinese, if you're

28
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,570
dealing with the Russians, any other
nation state, any other major APT group

29
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:39,180
like you fin-seven or somebody that,
their people suddenly one day wake

30
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,140
up and they're jacked into the matrix
and they can do all this. Almost as if

31
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,549
there's some modern-day Leavenworth
program for China and Russia to breed

32
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,110
out genius hackers out of a pot and then
they're coming after you.

33
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,180
Truth is, it's more like a Pokemon
evolution.  You learn, you build your skill

34
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,620
sets, make mistakes,
build your skill sets, make mistakes,

35
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,390
rinse, repeat. It's a slow evolution. This is
true for us we learn to become better

36
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:12,720
defenders, this is equally true for any
adversary you will face. So as I said,

37
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,299
there's this belief, you have your pot
born people straight out the matrix.

38
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:21,959
Russia the matrix. China and they're
ready to go

39
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:28,980
the moment they sit down at keyboard.
Once again, growth in stages.

40
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,780
So we're going to have a case study to help
understand this growth in stages. Now due

41
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,298
to the magic world of MBAs that
you deal with in information security

42
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,829
specialist defender. There's going to be
a good deal of this that is redacted. So

43
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:51,870
we're going to talk long terms without
getting into specific indicators. Because

44
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,370
it was the only way I was allowed to do
this talk. So in this situation,  I

45
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,380
haven't run out of the school of God
help me, hopefully not before any of you were

46
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,320
born. Who's working for his only Western

47
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,690
College as his assistant. Now, he had an issue where there was a brand new impersonation

48
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:15,470
that went after the college but in a
weird way that the college was more a

49
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,519
byproduct
like the HVAC company that led them to the

50
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,319
target, but without the network
actually being breached. It was branded

51
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:28,720
impersonation that was being used to
profit off of the alleged connection of

52
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,229
his fake identity
to that brand. Now one of the things we

53
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:37,508
learned is, colleges docking used, or at least the reputable ones. Most of them do not

54
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:43,659
register that dot com address. Adversaries are very willing to do that. Now in this

55
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:49,389
situation the adversary registered a domain with a similar name added dot com to

56
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:55,720
the university, claiming to be a project
spun off from the MBA school that does

57
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,690
business in a very specific region. The
goal was if you are in a country that is

58
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:06,639
not aligned with the US, and not
necessarily Russia or Iran, but somebody

59
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,690
who's just not considered an ally. It
might be difficult for you to do

60
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,759
business in the United States but this
business working with this Midwestern

61
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,409
MBA school will have they help you set
up a business entity in start doing work

62
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:27,819
in the United States for the classic
nominal fee so my buddy called me in is

63
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:31,150
that we have this issue and we're
digging around we haven't found anything

64
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,739
he didn't look at us
so you do a basic look because they have

65
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,860
a Sonny because they were going to fight
that they turn somebody did business

66
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,009
with this site it didn't work out so
they call the college to find out where

67
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:48,250
their money this is how they discovered
the site now like a good adversary who

68
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,419
is purely privacy guard and so there's
no information available it's a common

69
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,810
European host for anybody because the
defense you've probably heard of the AG

70
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,099
print and if you really dig into this
kind of a person Asian of those letters

71
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:06,009
money you know 1% closer to his children
there was no identifying information you

72
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,580
can pull at this point and the way they
were spinning their IDs through this

73
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,510
hosting site they would run it up on a
different IP almost like theirs

74
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,070
using DHCP and then they were pulling
information directly from the college

75
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:23,830
site pictures text graphics and just
Auto loading it into whatever fate is in

76
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:32,260
sight they were putting up now if you've
heard of got Twitter I have a series of

77
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,370
Maxim's I then you plug the information
security in life number one with the

78
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:41,080
bullet is deeper your adversary every
opportunity to make a mistake once again

79
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,870
we're not perfect
we have stumbles in our growth and our

80
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:49,720
learning and I'm a long enough timeline
everybody will make a mistake it turns

81
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,090
out this happens here did like my corner
- the bigger mistakes is is the idea of

82
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:00,909
a baseball's perfect game they're only
been 14 15 of them in history Randy

83
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:06,940
Johnson threw a perfect game which means
you threw 678 programs so the stakes are

84
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,250
out there and they're more common than
professional so I was having a

85
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,800
discussion with my friends we turned up
nothing

86
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,640
there's not much we can find here to do
something about this and he said imagine

87
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:26,409
the phrase he says this god this is just
like last time they did it again again

88
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,570
tell me about again what happened the
first time

89
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,900
well a few years ago this exact same
thing happened

90
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,640
plus the money there were some problems
they went dark the difference was the

91
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,289
domain name was one letter different all
right let's go take a look at that old

92
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:47,440
domain name now we can see you know
using like web archive work because you

93
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,900
catch things is ultimately the design of
it and the text and it was basically the

94
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,400
carbon copy what they were doing down
and then we went use passive DNS to look

95
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,530
at the Whois data you have privacy
privacy privacy one day where we have a

96
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:07,479
fool who is listing privacy privacy
privacy privacy and as you track it down

97
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,630
at one point the atmosphere is switched
hosting providers got a better deal was

98
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:18,310
checked out of we're used to be you who
knows when he made that switch in the

99
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,460
process of big events which that little
check box that says TV private wasn't

100
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,710
right so your registers that your who
donated its everything so and then just

101
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,599
email realizes wait I'm not I'm not
private I need to hide this information

102
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,569
so then they went back in and
immediately on the same day made that

103
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,169
change probably soon as they registered
it registered in and had everything

104
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,458
going dark now
with that change there was one moment

105
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:49,520
when everything was visible we have your
standard list phone number we have an

106
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,910
email address we have a street address
so using that committee to vote or Ghosn

107
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:03,079
we find tied to that street address for
the other websites it show but email got

108
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:09,470
us 12 more websites phone number got 12
more websites so one little hiccup and

109
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:15,529
now the pictures start bell tonight now
this is the point where we get to start

110
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:22,279
building a timer we have a fixed point
where we have data at that point you can

111
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,470
track are many different ways the tool
that I find most useful had loath beyond

112
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,579
belief I'm sure go on access to its all
its tell if you've done any kind of

113
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:35,779
hunting forensics threat intelligence
diagram any work you will use this tool

114
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:42,920
a lot and hopefully you do so without
getting really really angry so what we

115
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,380
can do here is we can charter on any of
these different sheets based on where do

116
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,779
we see their email address where do we
see any of these street address data and

117
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:58,279
more importantly as we get different
points along those lines we can build a

118
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:04,760
master timer so they're going to see
what somebody does when now the concept

119
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:12,079
of TCP says you're not familiar with its
tactics techniques and procedures it is

120
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,469
at the top of the indicator chain let's
the idea that

121
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,510
zebras have stripes she does have spots
they cannot change these it's similar to

122
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,860
when you
making scrambled eggs in the morning

123
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,300
you're making the same way every time
it's how you learn your boat you're

124
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:34,349
still set and you continue from there so
if yours are cute little InfoSec craft

125
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:41,760
we'll talk about or if the evolution of
our atmosphere so if we took the data

126
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,100
and go from when they are at their best
and work backward what we first saw it

127
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,670
is yes they learn to just make sure
privacy Gardens to be able under who has

128
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,630
at all times
then fact wouldn't go farther and we get

129
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:59,580
before practice er we see that they were
using different email addresses to run

130
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,510
the scams against a bunch of different
zones primarily English reason selves

131
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,290
reaching out to people who are not
friendly to those different countries so

132
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,550
you see different email addresses
registered before doing business in the

133
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:16,469
different regions you start seeing the
website that they're usually over and

134
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:22,020
over and over over time they started
updating but then you go far enough back

135
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,290
in the timeline since you've all just
spent over brand-new or just I can just

136
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,040
use the throwaway infrastructure this
gives us another data link that

137
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,170
correlates inside so we can see the lips
or the web server version correlate that

138
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,130
at the time and it's another two
identity a trust but verify stability is

139
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,960
going in the right direction now
eventually they figured out we want to

140
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,230
be out of bullet through post in one of
those countries where we know they're

141
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:53,190
not going to kick us off the service
anymore no farther back you look at the

142
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,410
phone number
the first phone number that popped up

143
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,819
was a Google Voice number you'll farther
back you see an original Google Voice

144
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,470
number that had an area code that was
tightly the address that had been

145
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,850
constant through all these registrations
now you go farther back you have a home

146
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,710
phone number that it's not the Google
Voice number that also lines up to the

147
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:18,210
original address that we used to pin to
get all of the data and eventually you

148
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,190
get to a point where they realize these
you only

149
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,720
one of these Bhutanese purser that is if
something gets caught they really burned

150
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:32,850
one part of their operation now bill
timeline we reached something that is a

151
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,930
bit of a unicorn in the information
security space we found the original

152
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:43,199
Legend this web server was it really bad
national to see the birth of coding or

153
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:50,780
HTML learning CSS and God help them it
still had the default condense the sent

154
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:56,100
so take a look inside you can see all
the lovely from their logs which god

155
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,700
bless when they turned out of their own
laws if you take a look at where all the

156
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,980
logins painful and the oklahoma jority
lucky guess and then all of the bottoms

157
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,540
was geo-located to an IP address that
lined up with the original phone number

158
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:15,510
that lined up with the street address so
as we say in information security

159
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:20,939
especially threat intelligence with high
confidence and we know who the

160
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,910
adversaries like we can put a name based
on the registration of public records to

161
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:33,030
death street address that we found the
god and what was nice as we went did a

162
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:39,390
google like a Google Earth Google Maps
search everyone popped up it showed us

163
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:43,410
an empty field but as we walked down the
street and followed it the one that you

164
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,120
directly to go he figured out that who
are the deserving for that didn't line

165
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,250
it up with geographic coordinates so
eventually we found a small little

166
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,930
building that had three trailers just
outside in the middle of nowhere and he

167
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,670
had a nice little address rocket that
had before digits the address on it one

168
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,839
of the buildings had a satellite dish on
top and which would cabling run again

169
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,800
when he buried underground and you spun
the camera on that Google Earth it

170
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,209
across the street in front of the other
other side of robos empty field somebody

171
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:20,940
had put in a brand new cable box so that
they could have fiber fiber : to the

172
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,240
home

173
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:33,480
all right you got through this early
yeah Bart I've come up the basic

174
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,580
takeaways our adversaries level up just
like we there's no there is no they

175
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,620
start and they're super it's a little
bit they learn they make mistakes those

176
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:49,290
mistakes can be trapped be patient be
diligent there's always more to

177
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,230
influence defiant
which means there's always more of a

178
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,520
difference to pivot on and then if
you're a defender one of the other

179
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,110
takeaways that comes away from this is
it's not always about getting your email

180
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,220
it's not always about getting your
servers sometimes the brand of your

181
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,200
institution can have a value in and of
itself and sometimes you need to look

182
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:18,270
externally to make sure you know who's
trying to use that brand all right

183
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:23,220
this was a relatively quick presentation
for everybody if you have questions I'm

184
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:28,650
happy to take questions yes they're good
question don't summon a matteri even

185
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:33,300
they get good they get lazy because if
something works why fix it a good

186
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,180
example of that is the Royals if you
follow anything apt 28 and 29 have done

187
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,300
there was a big discovery that they
talked about if thought count I want to

188
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,270
say two years ago
so if across where I came down to give

189
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:50,220
his talk on they were brought in to do
the forensics on the DNS servers and

190
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,000
they have found all this information
work you have to brush concedes it

191
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,540
independently guide under the servers
didn't build the other team was there

192
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,689
and it started making a lot of noise
thinking the other team was necessary

193
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:05,910
responders and trying to knock them out
but then as time is going on like you

194
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:11,100
look at that the scruple case coming out
of London and any of the other actions

195
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,000
by the
when has now become one of their chichi

196
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,410
pieces they don't care if they get
caught because when they get caught

197
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:24,689
nobody doesn't so there's there's a
certain degree of built-in laziness

198
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,620
depending on the atmosphere or the
atmosphere that makes assumptions that

199
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,240
the defender isn't working or they
haven't found this by this point so

200
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,810
they're not gonna find us at all and
that's where the trade crack can get

201
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:42,109
laid I brung back another good example
was with Assange in the newspaper today

202
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:47,040
- super - who was leaking all of this
information and they finally proved it

203
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,910
was Russian because it was knocking out
all this information they could

204
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,439
plausibly deny him a direction by saying
he's like me from Romania and then one

205
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,580
day he logged in most a bunch of stuff
to Twitter without turning on the view

206
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:06,839
p.m. and the attritional dependent so
this laziness does have like don't mean

207
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:13,470
Iran ever exactly firing the apt
wonderful is the same thing when they

208
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,579
post the report they've been a big deal
having a guy out in front of like that

209
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,859
the PLA there are we building in
Shanghai

210
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:39,980
so much it is well protected and as far
as your goes the Netherlands is one of

211
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:46,580
the bigger data center areas in Europe
West has a region there in the days

212
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,049
before Uwe was really that big I had
worked for a couple other companies who

213
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:56,000
had European data centers based their
partner being where they are was easier

214
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,039
to keep everything cool so it is just a
and that's the attention people spin up

215
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,240
data centers and suddenly he's a place
to buy cheap servers and then especially

216
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,320
if you're not with something like AWS
that we secure our borders they can send

217
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,030
in a new community because the sheer
volume of people doing bad things means

218
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:20,559
it's a lot of time before where runs the
actual server farm clean things up

219
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,750
perfectly
go for it some drinking it if you

220
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:32,330
haven't been to the same constant may or
may not be a password of course you know

221
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,730
but you know in our sector kind of I'm
not familiar with that if you don't know

222
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,530
the password you get to do a funny
little dance that is honest ended little

223
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,260
entryway that is on screen that you're
putting in the markets to look at like

224
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,720
that so everybody who goes in at least
once

225
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,919
just a little dance now although the
entrance is down an alleyway

226
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,059
yeah oh god blessing we I think we were
there two years you go to three years

227
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:00,500
ago I'm looking forward to it because
there's a speaker bag I get to come back

228
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,480
for my dance
but do you normally don't have one there

229
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,600
I do have to know there's a special
password to report from a politically I

230
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,918
can't remember where it is well more
Casper's cost offering but he's paying

231
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:17,840
attention this is my way of being nice
to all of you for coming to the talk so

232
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,049
thank you very much for stopping by
if you have any more questions I want to

233
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:27,530
reach out about anything I'm on Twitter
I'm somewhat active more active than my

234
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:31,019
blog because it doesn't require that
sit down there's nothing else for an

235
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:34,610
hour thank you

236
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,500
you
