1
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:25,190
Thank you everyone.
I... If I had not had the pleasure of

2
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,510
meeting you, I'm Jonathan Tomek. Most
people call me Sakebomb because that's

3
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,390
just been the fun handle that I've had
for the past, I don't know what? 20 years? Which is just

4
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:42,020
crazy in itself. So, Michael asked me to
speak on something anything other than

5
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,879
what anybody else is presenting. So I
have had an interest in ham radio for a

6
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:53,360
few years and I'm gonna try to do a few
things for you. If I'm not sure how many

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,190
hams there are in this room? But
hopefully I can inspire you to become a

8
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,440
ham. If not, encourage you to do
actually something really good with you

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,869
having your license.
So, other than finding something more fun

10
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:15,619
to speak into, I decided that, hey bring
it out there and learn as much as I can

11
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:19,820
within the short amount of time. Which was basically a month he gave me, and said hey,

12
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:28,548
go speak, alright. So, I just got a
new call sign which is K4RUK.

13
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:33,770
Kilo, four, Romeo, uniform, kilo. You guys
should probably try to learn that fun

14
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:39,470
alphabet. If you have not already learned
that. As it'll really help you, especially

15
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,908
when you speak to the foreign language
speakers overseas. Because it is

16
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:48,979
extremely hard. It's kind of like saying
N as in Nancy doesn't really transition

17
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:57,830
well everywhere. But a, it's yeah. It's just good to know. So, I a, I've cornered the market on the

18
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:03,079
whole sake bomb name. Which is pretty
fantastic. Except for reddit sadly. I have

19
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:10,160
a friend there that just won't hook me
up at all, but anyway. If you've ever met

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,980
me before, it's probably because I have
seen you down in ThoughtCon in Chicago. I'm one of

21
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,299
the founders down there
and I've been doing that for the past

22
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,970
ten years. And I do quite a lot of things
there with whether it's registration, CTF

23
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:29,280
stuff, hanging out with you guys, probably
being... I can't swear on TV I think these are being

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,980
recorded right? So, being a jerk with a lot
of you guys, trying to encourage you to

25
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:41,640
learn a lot of different things. And it,
my whole primary objective is just to

26
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,369
get everybody in here inspired. I want
everybody to become a better Hacker..

27
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,940
That's effectively what it is and I'm
here to see that threaded throughout

28
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:58,260
some of this talk. So, just quick question
for everyone in here. Who in

29
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,100
here's a ham? I just want to see. So there
are a couple, so good. I actually do have

30
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:09,510
some people, so I don't have to talk just
on the basics. All right. So, to begin. Why

31
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,620
are you here? I actually really don't
know why you're here but I'm guessing it

32
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,460
is with ham radio and it excites you but
more importantly that there really is

33
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,030
nothing for you to do right now I don't
really know why you're here I would not

34
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,380
be here I usually don't even go to
clocks myself especially 8:00 yeah but

35
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,950
great but I think this is probably one
of the biggest the biggest things here

36
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:37,320
is hams argh
especially hackers are very we're not

37
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,540
really community driven as much as we
possibly could be and it's kind of funny

38
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,310
because there's people in ham radio like
all the owners all the people that have

39
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,780
been doing it for a long time which is a
much older crew and if the hackers over

40
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,040
here but that fine sliver down the
middle is even smaller than you could

41
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,620
imagine and I do have a couple places
that I can help you guys get into to get

42
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,850
more involved because we're of all the
different hacker groups I think we are

43
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,700
probably the most encouraging of
everyone that wants to help and will not

44
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,149
shame you for not knowing things I mean
that's that's most of the hacker

45
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,510
community for sure but absolutely the
Hamm community just because it's the

46
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:27,580
most the biggest a movie
so again I'm here I want to inspire you

47
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,870
and give you some something to be
passionate about because that is the

48
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,790
biggest thing that I've noticed just
throughout my entire time of whether

49
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:45,580
it's presenting or being out in the real
world with my normal job that you very

50
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,840
rarely find somebody that's so
passionate about doing any hobby and if

51
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,789
I could just give you this much of it I
will feel like I got my job done and

52
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:04,780
that's so just for the for those that
are not hands in here and I'll try to

53
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:12,429
ramp up slowly by the end for those that
are hands some of the reasons that I

54
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:19,840
personally am at Hamm is I this weird
survivalist I I'm burying and I've had

55
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,489
to go through several X Fund experiences
and episodes where having a radio and

56
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,950
knowing how to use a radio is very very
useful but also living in DC we've had

57
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:36,370
some major instances where if you did
not have a radio skill you probably were

58
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,760
in the heavy a very very scary time so
we had other than 911 which I'm sure

59
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,480
many of you all know about they cut all
the cellphones and nobody was even

60
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:52,120
allowed to communicate out and not too
long ago actually I think it was almost

61
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,230
seven years ago we had an earthquake in
DC which you wouldn't think it was like

62
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:02,410
a 3.2 whatever and it's like nothing
ecstatic some of the stuff that you just

63
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,570
be like oh whatever but apparently it
caused so much so much of a problem that

64
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,770
some ability was crumbled it even
affected the Washington Memorial that

65
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,750
they there were so many emergencies but
all the cell phones including some of

66
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:23,890
the internet was cut out for a good day
nobody communicated was actually crazy

67
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:30,550
pandemonium especially in DC of all
places that you couldn't like I think

68
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,370
this is this
the one city you do not want to ever get

69
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:40,340
stuck in at birth because people are so
on edge it's East Coast it's like

70
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:46,130
hypertension traffic like jams whatever
but my god did having a radio like save

71
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,050
the day for like I felt like this the
biggest thing lifted because I was

72
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,460
talking my neighbors about it they were
like I couldn't get hold my kids didn't

73
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,580
even know they where they were at school
this schools closed all that everything

74
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,039
so if that's enough to get you going
please do it it's really really cool to

75
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,720
do but even bigger than that other than
my survival stuff cuz I could go to rant

76
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:16,910
on that for an hour
is just knowing how to use and apply a

77
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,560
lot of the things that you learn from
ham in the IOT realm this is by far the

78
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,130
biggest frontier right now this is where
the Wild West is of the internet that

79
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:31,820
mean we have so many new things coming
out that most people just haven't even

80
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,740
touched yet so this is where I would
really want to encourage you to start

81
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,550
touching just learn some of the
fundamentals keep your license so that

82
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,400
you know how to transmit just so you can
do things legally and then it'll to

83
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,989
start making a lot more sense about all
these different fun things and

84
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,750
techniques it's like it's like grabbing
at low-hanging fruit you're like oh my

85
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,020
god I can I can do that and then tap
talk and that people think I'm like a

86
00:07:54,020 --> 00:08:02,419
genius like that's wait it is it's just
another thing for you to think about but

87
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:08,359
this this will really just bring this
whole bring you all together because we

88
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,610
in this like that niche little can
hacker community I was talking about

89
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,970
everybody always wants to talk about all
these fun little projects they've been

90
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:22,430
working on and I've been realizing
outside and then even bubble bit

91
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,740
everyone here rarely even see some of
those fun little projects they talk

92
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,270
about just because nobody goes up and
presents on it I mean this is another

93
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,610
thing I did encourage you you can
present yourself because it's going to

94
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,110
make you want to learn something and if
you're full of oh my god do I know

95
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:44,240
enough like I'm the one speaking I think
I have to answer all the questions in

96
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,160
the room
or is that bad kind of silly up there

97
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,390
but the thing is it causes you to have
to learn a lot of the answers of the

98
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:55,550
questions that even yourself need to
have and that group doesn't even present

99
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:02,109
so I would love for you guys to even do
like get involved in it it'll really

100
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:13,160
bring us all together so the big things
with getting really really involved just

101
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:19,250
pick a simple project this is where I'm
like I'm trying to inspire you I have

102
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:24,200
got a couple of them listed right after
this but with that project it's gonna

103
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,690
give you enough of something that you've
always wanted to do it's whether it's

104
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:36,380
working with some of the most basic
technologies I mean you need to have

105
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,110
something that's going to drive you
forward and this has been every which

106
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,740
way in just your typical hacker
lifestyle anyway man I don't know what

107
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,060
got you into being here but something
made you passionate to say hey I'm gonna

108
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,589
go to cypher can't be here today because
there's something I want to learn that's

109
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:56,930
how you get better at everything so just
find a simple project if you don't have

110
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,040
one or you just even a little bit
interested I'll be happy to start you

111
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:07,550
CTS are probably the best way to do that
so it helps you start really really

112
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,459
small and work your way up and then say
you know what I really just want to work

113
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:17,300
on this project and it'll really really
a cancer set your novel set eating your

114
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:24,219
technicians license is also one of the
easiest things you possibly do I mean

115
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,980
you need a 73% category to get this exam
I mean you guys can study for an hour

116
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:36,740
because I'm sure everybody here's really
intelligent you have to get 26 questions

117
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:45,530
out of 35 just to get this license it is
super super easy and that's your first

118
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,650
step I mean once you get that I mean you
can start playing and talking on the

119
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:55,040
radio we believe that's any band that is
it's a restricted band for you but if

120
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,900
you do once
outside of just listening to like the

121
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,069
police scanners go go hey the stuff is
will do cool I can hear police officer

122
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:07,410
but it it really opens up your world and
that's that first step that actually

123
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,959
gets you like really excited it really
gets you going it's kind of like that

124
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,310
feeling you get after you up you watch
the cockers you're like damn what the

125
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,930
hell am i doing I'm like wasting my life
why am I like just sitting here when I

126
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:24,689
can totally like be making bag look dead
I mean this is this is simple

127
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:32,010
fundamental steps then get your radium I
mean this is people it can be an

128
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:37,590
extremely expensive hobby yes I totally
like if you don't know every hobby that

129
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:45,510
we have is probably really good so with
him you can actually start fairly cheap

130
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,800
with I mean there's a lot of direction
to care a lot of the group would be

131
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,479
willing to sell you old gear or you can
serve with an SDR you can have some of

132
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,790
these fancy things like this line SDR
which can literally intercept cellphones

133
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:05,550
and do video and play with it it's
pretty badass or you can get this like

134
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:12,569
an RTLS the SDR which is like $10 little
Chinese do hit me then you can plug in

135
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:19,920
and start intercepting and transmitting
but it does not it's not perfect don't

136
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,329
get me wrong but nonetheless there's a
lot of really cool projects you can do

137
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,230
with it so bathroom like that next step
and then finally just getting in this

138
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,339
community and I would love for you to
look at the slide itself because in here

139
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:40,260
I'm not going to there's two discs or
groups that are full of lot that sliver

140
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,630
of hackers that are also hands that I
was talking about and surprisingly

141
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:51,450
there's it's a global community like
some people are in lots of us but but

142
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:55,740
all over and they are all willing to
really help you everything that you want

143
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,620
to do so
with that being said so some of the

144
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,910
things that we've all talked about in
the group as well as some of the

145
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:11,969
projects that I wanted to do or are
listed up here and hopefully you guys

146
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,630
will see how it like actually simplest
stuff is so working with a satellite

147
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:22,580
everybody's like how badass is that oh
yeah I talk stats all the time yeah like

148
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,280
does that have some cool I mean I think
that sounds cool I mean my wife thinks

149
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:35,730
I'm an absolutely heat but she's my
husband smart is it's literally no

150
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,510
different than like talking to some of
these some of the repeaters I mean it's

151
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,020
like using a cell phone except with
these the repeater towers but you're

152
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,470
just doing with the radio but some of
the really really cool things we do with

153
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:51,120
just working with satellites is you can
start downloading a lot of imagery you

154
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,280
can work with a lot of the free ones
that are out there

155
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:59,280
universities launch them there's like
CubeSat programs and it's it's a it's a

156
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,900
huge world I mean there there's parts
where you can sell they sell time and

157
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,579
you can even download imagery of fun
locations and this is kind of a fun fact

158
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:13,850
that I don't know if you guys know is I
guess it's legal but it's pseudo deal

159
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:18,540
there's groups that will sell you
imagery time to take pictures of any

160
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,670
place on the world for very very very
low month money and we're talking like I

161
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:29,490
don't know like ten bucks and there's
places that our government doesn't want

162
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:35,460
you to take pictures up but you kind of
have to be able to do that stuff so just

163
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,920
letting you know that that stuff those
options are out there if you're really

164
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:47,339
interested in say I don't know you clear
silos or anyway so it's fun stuff to do

165
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,750
and I highly encourage it I include some
links on here so you guys can see some

166
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,580
of the programs and how to use like a
satellite tracking program really really

167
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:03,060
basic sadly some things are really
really Windows we're lying and I hate to

168
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,130
say that but that's just because the
community is involved that way but

169
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,590
virtual machines all the ways totally ok
a lot of stuff is also

170
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,320
in space there's a lot of really cool
programs that are free you can use but

171
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,920
anyway next this is probably one of the
biggest ones that actually gets a lot of

172
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,630
people kind of annoyed in the Hamm
community which is digital boats because

173
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:32,290
is it really radio if you're using it
through the internet so this this little

174
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:38,050
radio is is a lot of fun because you
could use it with they they're like

175
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:43,839
Huygens they're there you just by little
by little the other thing and yes I'm

176
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,340
transmitting a little radio wave to this
thing that negotiated in it but it lets

177
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:54,190
you do a lot of these tiny moves that
makes the actual audio and the video is

178
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:58,600
clear but I mean this is the sound the
Internet is I mean you can also set up a

179
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,390
big repeater and do this stuff but with
traditional hackery that's literally why

180
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:08,100
it exists so I highly recommend checking
it out that's probably one of the

181
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,610
simplest and easiest to use methods
other than just the traditional like

182
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,970
single sideband once you start playing
with you ham radio that that's the first

183
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:24,730
thing you probably want to do that is to
DMR is one of the bigger ones there's a

184
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:29,890
D star there's one league which said
they might even disappear one day very

185
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:35,890
soon but who knows the the next is this
thing called PSP 31 was a phase shift

186
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,660
and key this is a really really cool
method of protocol so hopefully

187
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,910
everybody in here knows what a protocol
is like tcp/ip like this is your

188
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:50,699
standard of how data is going to flow
it's actually extremely efficient for

189
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,300
anything because we have the internet we
are the ability to have tons of loss

190
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:03,839
packet loss etc yes a31 allows you to
send data but let's say I wanted to send

191
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,940
really short message to you that was
just like wow or hello world every bite

192
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,150
that you send you don't want to have too
much overhead so I thought was gonna

193
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:16,050
send an a that need like a 1-bit but
then if I would need to send it be you

194
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:21,560
kind of be following up by her level but
you don't you always are dropping a

195
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:30,090
bunch of the bits so a B would be a 1 0
a C would be a 1 it's like you wouldn't

196
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,439
even actually give me a 1 0 0 1 these
always ends in a 1 and always ends it

197
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,630
starts with a 1 so that you're
eliminating all that data loss so it's a

198
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:46,320
pretty cool little uh protocol to learn
and it might be one that you should

199
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:57,950
learn if you next ETF's especially ones
that I like to run so check it out next

200
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:03,360
this one is really really cool and if
you have not heard of an ampere net look

201
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,949
into this this is basically free
Internet ipv4 space because we're

202
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:14,310
already going with all of that but is
the internet over and there's it's

203
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:19,260
actually seen in that much different
formats but super-slow works for IRC

204
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,720
email X PRIZE Lee does boy I really
don't know how because it's really

205
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,680
crappy quality but it doesn't have that
it does what I use it for IRC and it's

206
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,290
kind of fun it's kind of like one of
those things that I wanted to actually

207
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:42,300
set up because I want to get the oh crap
moments where you're like hey everything

208
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,980
went down can I send out a quick email
or something just or a message out and

209
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,120
then have have enough trigger back work
of its that's the ones that the Deadman

210
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,080
switch sounds like that was that was fun
I don't know why I do those things I

211
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,179
mean I don't do you guys do that stuff
maybe now I'm just but anyway ampere met

212
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:06,030
really really cool and within with an
internet that there's really big

213
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:10,590
communities that use different including
here's you have used the big witty like

214
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,560
they'll actually read
the firmware completely and start this

215
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,060
massively network like there's a big one
up like in the Seattle area there's one

216
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:23,700
in my Europe and it's literally in my
opinion that's actually what true dark

217
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,110
metas or cement or because you don't
have to rely anything on the Internet

218
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:33,929
these are true internet like separate
internet communities that all leverage

219
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:40,830
their own data but it still requires him
to do even though the radio signals can

220
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:46,649
be over Wi-Fi for whatever is it's the
amount of power that they need and then

221
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:52,110
the complete reverse of that is this
thing called qrp mode and oh I didn't

222
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:56,040
even explain with Kiera P stands for but
they're in him they have a lot of really

223
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:02,520
short notations and it's part of what CW
is like Morse code whenever you're

224
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,850
sending messages you want to be as fast
as possible so you can really like crush

225
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:11,850
everything down into like three letters
and so therapy just means low-power mode

226
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:17,280
and a lot of really cool things can
happen with this this is probably one of

227
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,530
those oh yeah I did that but no I'm I
don't think I will ever do this stuff

228
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:28,950
just visits extremely difficult like the
fact that somebody can use a mic robot

229
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:34,200
to send something Connor to see you've
got 1,650 miles like absolutely bonkers

230
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:45,990
we're talking that is less power than a
analog watch uses like think about that

231
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,290
for a second like I don't know how the
hell somebody did that but you have to

232
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:54,750
take like the time you get there like
where the Sun is high up there like also

233
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:59,460
this damn stuff and like people do this
stuff but this also includes like moon

234
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,030
shots like shooting up your power up to
the moon bouncing off of that a lot of

235
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:07,379
people do this it's fun little hugging
you actually get listed in record books

236
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,090
which hey more power to you but it's
it's still something really really cool

237
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:16,620
just something for you guys to look into
that's also where like low row comes

238
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:24,120
from if you guys ever play with that
that's the legal non-han like data is

239
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,949
stuff
if you ever won the send like little

240
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:37,600
power long-range messages or data
alright so the things to do with him and

241
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,929
this is where this will get you really
going is definitely play the CT apps

242
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:47,800
like I was saying earlier we have one
going on right here super easy get

243
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:53,860
involved there everybody on that team
wants you to learn they're there to help

244
00:21:53,860 --> 00:22:00,070
you and the equipment that they give you
if you win is like were thousands upon

245
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:05,080
thousands it's worth more than like you
guys could would ever want to like spend

246
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,480
yourselves but they click this really
self but it also teaches a lot of fun

247
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,440
fundamentals that you in gives you more
projects that didn't really think about

248
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,020
and like the Fox hunts if you ever want
somebody walking around the room they're

249
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:33,280
like with their laptop it gets a little
creepy but hey whatever but that's what

250
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,610
they're doing they're they're trying to
find a signal and triangle a signal and

251
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,899
except they're not trying to believe me
that's a state line so that's that's

252
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,900
where I yeah he comes into play and
hopefully any but if you don't know what

253
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,590
it yeah he is in here that's that one
metal little bar that has all those

254
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,639
lines in it that you can direct
point-to-point shoot that's gonna give

255
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:58,660
you the best power for your distance
ratio and with that you parable people

256
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:04,060
and you can triangulate and there are
really cool programs out there and and

257
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:08,860
or right one that could help you
triangulate extremely fast if there's a

258
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:13,649
fast moving object or you really want to
translate Excel faster and there's in

259
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:20,920
the hand world because we are self
regulating which is such funny and bad

260
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:29,080
idea at the same time but hands and
hands are traditionally like really good

261
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,620
about being hands like you're not
supposed to do that

262
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,820
I know we're all policemen but at the
same time we do look the other way but

263
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,210
yet there's really
people that are doing like these pirate

264
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,660
radio stations in like California they
get finally hundreds of thousands of

265
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,800
dollars they've been doing it for like
15 years and like had not been quite

266
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:53,379
like what the hell but hey what's that
saying it's keeping honest people honest

267
00:23:53,380 --> 00:24:00,580
and hands are like the most honest of
people I don't know why but the why I

268
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:07,510
was going with that is within that self
policing group there's volunteers that

269
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:13,600
do these box hunts for people that are
breaking the hand code they're breaking

270
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,669
actual violations doing too much power
like you can't go over 1,500 watts which

271
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:23,650
is a lot anyway that's like they'll give
you a headache just to walk back but

272
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:31,780
people do this stuff that's the old CB
radios like nasty stuff but they usually

273
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:36,160
have groups of people that will be ones
and twos and they can triangulate by

274
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,950
using these programs and pinpoint
exactly and it's really really quick

275
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,960
that's actually how the GPS tracking
your phone works more so than just the

276
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,910
GPS tracker they just use cell phone
technology to triangulation so other

277
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:55,450
than meat and venting on CTF stuff
please please check out just you could

278
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,390
probably check out some of those simple
problems that they have and be like oh I

279
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:03,130
did this in 30 seconds or 30 minutes
anyway I learned maybe I've captured

280
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:08,740
about that one dating my next thing
there is a number station and I tried

281
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,309
the audio on here so I apologize I
wanted to play for you but I could

282
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:17,620
probably if you want to speak to you and
number station and Russian because I

283
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:24,399
mean why not but there's several more
than several famous number station this

284
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,050
is probably one of the coolest like if
you are ever into like those science

285
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:35,800
fiction or like all about figuring out
like spies and stuff they have numerous

286
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:41,710
number stations that still exist and
what they are is traditionally a metro

287
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,450
station is just number same you hear
over the radio ways like whether it's

288
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:53,429
or sideband just you hear it and it's
just like one seven three and you just

289
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:57,510
hear this consistently and people think
it literally could be anything or it

290
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,870
could just be trolls which I really
believe there are still trolls out there

291
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,529
just tuning in for fun I mean especially
in Russia I mean what a better way to

292
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:09,269
like throw up the US meddling had these
numerous amounts of numbers that just

293
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:13,980
get big blasted for years I think also
some of the people lifelike died and

294
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,000
like just let it go because they're
still the battery backups and for

295
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,299
whatever reason nobody here to take them
down but they they still are kind of fun

296
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:27,750
and people still try to figure out what
the hell they're doing and and sometimes

297
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,279
actually figure them out so one of the
most popular ones is the the Russian man

298
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,029
and you can still hear that if you if
you pick up most radios you can hear it

299
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:40,889
pretty well at night because of the way
the atmosphere works and I will not bore

300
00:26:40,889 --> 00:26:45,209
you until you get your ham license with
all my fun ham knowledge about how

301
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:51,750
atmospheric conditions work sunspots and
stuff like that but that's that's gonna

302
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,139
be your most opportune time to hear
anything from overseas you can actually

303
00:26:55,139 --> 00:26:59,070
hear Japan like probably about 30
minutes after Sun Goes Down that's

304
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:04,250
really cool
we can't talk to him he asked which

305
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:10,529
number stations had they figured out I
think there was one it was like three or

306
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:18,330
four years ago they found out some guy
died and the radio stations numbers were

307
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:24,210
like a countdown to what was it usually
it was surprisingly something really

308
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,200
stupid so I hate to even bring them on
it but that was like one of it but at

309
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,059
the same time you kind of like I love
the mystery of this number station is

310
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:38,190
but damn I figured a diamond is really
crap but maybe just maybe one of them is

311
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:43,650
gonna read really badass
and I kinda wanted maybe having to do

312
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:47,190
this in the following year but I want to
take one of the number station for

313
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:50,220
repeat so maybe it's like PI or
something and they're gonna crack that

314
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,670
code
but here the number station sequence and

315
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:58,680
then use that for a puzzle so maybe just
leave that but now that's well that was

316
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:06,050
the one that I think I remember if I
remember it correctly was the exact case

317
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:15,389
partner all right so next is this this
is where the lowest hanging fruit really

318
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:21,000
comes in for him if you have not had the
opportunity to see Open Sesame

319
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:29,310
by Sammy really probably one of the best
hacking inspirational videos that you'll

320
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:34,919
see in the past ten years
hands down he took I think it was as

321
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:42,090
sisters or his daughters old little like
Speak & Spell toy and was able to make

322
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:49,830
it open up any crime short any garage
door and the work through the process to

323
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:55,860
how he figured that out was just freakin
badass and I just just give you a little

324
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:02,820
like flow on this he won he just
listened to the frequency and you can

325
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:08,760
figure out hey I can send these bits and
bytes so he just cloned his garage door

326
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,910
open of the first one and then he's like
okay well let's figure out the protocol

327
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:16,230
okay I got the promo club down now I can
just blast all the pipes okay it'll take

328
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:21,450
20 hours to open up any garage door
which is an enormous amount of time okay

329
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:26,610
well how do we compress that we'll
figure out all of the exact number of

330
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:30,179
bytes
okay well that hastened it up but then

331
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,320
he ends up figuring out all the way down
to the bare bones of it that there's

332
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,710
this really cool mathematical formula
that

333
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,010
recommended and that's like way smarter
than all of us in this room that's like

334
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:48,950
super over there figured out that you
that airwaves are kind of like this

335
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:55,909
receive all that similar to how you can
do like Mac spoofing on Wi-Fi where you

336
00:29:55,909 --> 00:30:00,080
can have two or more the same MAC
addresses on the Wi-Fi network because

337
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,379
it doesn't know how to connect to the
specific device and still communicate

338
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:09,020
it's similar for that of craft stores
it's just always listening waiting for

339
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:15,590
the exact right bytes so let's say I was
gonna send the opening code was like one

340
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:21,379
zero one one one zero or whatever it was
it's listening for that exact number so

341
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:26,090
he figured out this mathematical guy
figured out the exact equation so that

342
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:31,250
you could say I have something that's 32
bytes long and I need to use all the

343
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:37,549
possible combinations ever of that
binary sequence and transmit them so it

344
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:42,649
would be like this random random ass
like one zero one zero sequence that

345
00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:47,510
would literally open the garage door in
like three seconds which totally defeats

346
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:52,220
the whole twenty hour thing and all on
this little kid like kids toy you're

347
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,370
like damn that inspires me I could never
do that

348
00:30:55,370 --> 00:31:00,320
he said that same thing please check
stuff out like that it's really really

349
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,470
cool and on there this is why I hinted
there's gas fireplaces things like

350
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,169
wouldn't it be kind of funny if you're
like driving down the road and you just

351
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:14,659
push your button because like all like
these peoples gas powered like

352
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:18,860
fireplaces to have a radio frequency and
they all are labeled like you could look

353
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,189
this stuff up online it's not hard to
read some of this you just push in there

354
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,720
is like fireplace turns I believe

355
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:33,549
did you do that no but I mean there's
other uses for other than controlling

356
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:37,750
people I mean I kind of like the
trolling content but I wanted to always

357
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:45,570
do it so that I get lazy and I just be
like hey like so ok Google will you

358
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,678
because I'm not gonna pay like $500 for
a stupid little like Wi-Fi like remote

359
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:58,660
starter when I can just like click a
button but anyway and last is this this

360
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:03,280
power meter on the right and this is I
can't talk too much about this project

361
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:09,010
that I worked on other than there's a
fun thing called breaking the cyber

362
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:14,799
kinetic barrier and what that
effectively is is something in the

363
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,879
digital realm that effects something in
the physical realm breaking the

364
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:27,309
connection as it says so when you were
kids you probably remember meter maids

365
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:30,520
walking around to your house and
checking the meter saying hey this

366
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:35,410
person used this much like gas or
electricity whatever it isn't they go

367
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:39,040
well those jobs don't exist anymore I
don't know if anybody really know missed

368
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:45,668
that but something I noticed after I was
like you know what it was like some

369
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:50,110
drunken conversation I don't know and
you start reading them all these open

370
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:55,449
specs and you can find out that a lot of
these devices have very very cool ways

371
00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:00,070
of communicating all of the data and
they actually are both receive and

372
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:07,330
transmit so you can do a lot of bad
things like cause massive blackouts

373
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:15,340
because everybody has the same power
company in those areas just in so it's

374
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,570
scare a few people so that's why I can't
tell you too much detail about it but I

375
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:26,799
will tell you that there's no way to fix
any of these problems just through it's

376
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,840
not like you could just update firmware
on like millions I mean what are we at

377
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,490
like 200 plus million people in the US
but nonetheless you're talking so

378
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:41,920
millions of houses don't even know what
everybody has but totally recommend

379
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,190
looking this and this would be like that
fun thing you're like you know what hey

380
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:50,050
let's not talk about this maybe this can
be done my god what a way to talk in any

381
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:55,930
conference there you go that's that's
your first is your first one there and

382
00:33:55,930 --> 00:34:00,700
then on the left I didn't put it out
there but Gautama which is like an

383
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:07,420
actual new like way to transmit with
like your cell phone that you can make

384
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:14,350
this mesh network of phones like using
those devices and basically somebody

385
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,350
actually popped them all and was able to
do anything they want with them even

386
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:22,210
though they're corrected but these
aren't used in a lot of countries which

387
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:26,949
I didn't even know there's like a like
micro black market like especially like

388
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:31,120
quarter we go for some reason because of
like the massive hurricane that happen

389
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,080
there so they those things are selling
for like a thousand dollars a pop which

390
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:40,840
is absurd because you get home for like
60 bucks but they needed them because

391
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,020
there was no way to communicate with
anybody like I was saying for that

392
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:49,449
survival is victory but he wouldn't it
be really cool if you could just play

393
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:53,408
with some of this stuff and then give a
talk on it well yeah that's exactly why

394
00:34:53,409 --> 00:35:04,120
I'm talking about it alright so these
and this is where I guess the those that

395
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:08,830
are in hands probably should should care
this is where I'm gonna I guess taken

396
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:15,640
more serious no the for those that are
hands you should probably really know

397
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,069
about what's going on with the new FCC
regulations that are going on for those

398
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:24,010
that are about hands you should probably
care about some of these things that are

399
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:31,290
going up our FCC is a nightmare right
now but actually it's probably think

400
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:37,290
it's it's no different ever been but for
whatever unknown reason they're deciding

401
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:41,490
let's apply all of these things that we
could possibly do and

402
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:48,750
like move stuff along and not saying
that this is a bank not that I don't

403
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:56,880
know if any of you know what what this
means here but in this there what the

404
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,270
FCC is trying to do they're trying to
pass this resolution and it's supported

405
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:04,740
by an interesting group what some are
hams yes and others are not but I must

406
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:10,770
say most are not they're trying to make
ham only accessible but everything

407
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:15,750
that's transmitted over there has to be
completely open and this is I know

408
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,760
that's something you're like oh yeah
well then sorry asleep knows like

409
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:24,090
whatever sign it's it actually is way
way more ridiculous it means like you

410
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:33,300
cannot use like PSK 31 like why like do
you not understand it's like you can't

411
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:39,270
use Bitcoin because I don't understand
it that is like the dumbest reason to

412
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:45,330
not use something it's like their their
concept behind it is hey terrorism is

413
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:50,130
bad I actually know all this stuff is
bad just I don't understand it stop

414
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,600
doing it it should only be for voice
like the Internet's not for voice only

415
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:04,859
units so check this out like this is why
bit more hands that can exist them keep

416
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:08,720
pushing that might sound like a broken
record

417
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,640
it just involved things just learn about
what's actually going on because this

418
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:21,560
this could be actually tremendously
difficult down the way I mean imagine if

419
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,220
we this could put a halt on a bunch of
different types of protocols and new

420
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,100
technologies that you guys could
eventually or your kids or whomever

421
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:33,509
would try to create so I want you to
look look and read about some of the

422
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,510
stuff and you can actually make comments
even though you're not a ham that's just

423
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:42,930
it's really interesting to note some of
these things that are happening so I I

424
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:48,569
can only imagine if they're trying to do
this in an area that most people are

425
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:53,010
like obviously it's an amateur you got a
pay but it's it's a small enough market

426
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,940
space that
people are not going to like have too

427
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,450
much of an impact but imagine that this
is going to happen like I'm gonna say

428
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:03,680
the net neutrality thing cuz that's a
whole nother realm but imagine if they

429
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,460
have something here but it was just that
one more step into affecting the rest of

430
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:11,480
it like okay but we started doing it
over in this round why aren't we doing

431
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,770
it over here because the law is already
this way that's that's the sort of thing

432
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:19,070
that's gonna happen so that's why I want
some of you guys would look into this

433
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:25,850
stuff there's an actual name for which
what is it called

434
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:36,770
it's RN 11 831 so it's something to read
about and and look into okay so with

435
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:43,759
that oops
one of the other fun things is for those

436
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,270
that are not hams encryption and not
gonna ask all of you guys what you guys

437
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:55,790
think about encryption but I will say
that you're not oh you're not supposed

438
00:38:55,790 --> 00:39:02,690
to do encryption over here it's kind of
like this fundamental um ham code it's

439
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:07,040
actually illegal but its encryption is
very funny word actually they don't

440
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,410
intend to say encryption this is it's
one of the bylaws and it says you're not

441
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:19,759
supposed to obfuscate the meaning of
your transmission so if I was going to

442
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:26,270
speak in super twin code to you saying
the bird flies at midnight

443
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:31,700
like that could that be obviously having
a meeting I don't know if you're a twin

444
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,930
you totally get what you're talking
about I mean it seems a little funny

445
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:40,660
like the number stations
like this stuff just exists anything's

446
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,649
this than the US tip so I don't know
where they get this but then they also

447
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:49,240
go to say that the encryption level is
also one of those things but if you

448
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,790
publish your keys so for example you saw
earlier I was talking about how you can

449
00:39:54,790 --> 00:40:01,930
have Wi-Fi over him well that's if you
use nulled out and critic users you

450
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:06,310
wanted to use SSH your SSL which is like
what the hell's the point at that point

451
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:11,680
but the thing is if you also publish
your encryption key that's just as okay

452
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,149
what did you think technically it is and
like the hammer oil like five people go

453
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:20,140
to argue that the funny thing is they're
super against that occupation of the

454
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,710
meat which is even more concise i mean
lawyers like fight over all this crap

455
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:35,590
anyway but with that being said there's
the next bit which is if I have a

456
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:40,600
special repeater anywhere and you wanted
to speak with it and transmit because

457
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,750
that's something you're allowed to do to
him and give hoping that open everybody

458
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:48,630
else how do I communicate with that
remote device if it's in the mountains

459
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:53,820
securely so that nobody knows her so
nobody like brace into it and does

460
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:59,440
whoever that whatever they want with it
you have to do encryption wouldn't you

461
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,650
think so that's actually one of those
newly like brought great lines that a

462
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:11,110
lot of hams like tend to like abide by
that you can remote in encrypted Li to

463
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:14,770
this device but everything else has to
be completely open and you're not

464
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:24,190
allotted like talking code with your
friends anyway so if you want to

465
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,270
disagree with me I would love to happen
to me because I think that's kind of

466
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:37,600
like my thing how I roll with it but so
anyway I don't want to bore you too too

467
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:44,549
much any longer because closed rooms so
with that

468
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:51,240
for those that are attending thought
cotton listen up so I found this project

469
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:58,709
which has the most absolutely
unfortunately that is a person using

470
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:04,350
Raspberry Pi and slow scam television
which is SSTV and they're from

471
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,860
Netherlands so they don't really you
know what they're talking about but if

472
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:16,890
you if you lower case everything and if
you put PI SS T V all together you have

473
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:23,220
a very miss spell work and it's a fun
little project that I'd like you to

474
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:30,959
check out it's yeah I mean these from
Amsterdam but how would you really know

475
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,640
I mean you should know but nonetheless
totally look into that project that

476
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:42,450
might be something I'm if not it's for
your edification also Morse code so this

477
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:46,740
is this is one of those things that I
really really enjoy and you don't

478
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,189
actually don't need to know CW to be
able to get your ham license by the way

479
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:54,690
that was something that was removed from
the license requirement of two years ago

480
00:42:54,690 --> 00:43:00,030
so but was really really cool about more
suppose a lot of people still do it and

481
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:02,610
it's kind of like one of those cool
things that you could like start hearing

482
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:07,920
you're like oh yeah I know that yeah
you're totally in there then but the

483
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,320
what what I like to do is like I'd like
to do automatic listening of it and

484
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,660
being able to repeat some of that back
because that's a lot legally you're

485
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:19,020
allowed to do a lot of these repeating
and playing as long as you transmit your

486
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:24,840
your callsign back so fun stuff for you
guys to look into its having a really

487
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:30,740
cool little method and I might be doing
a little fox hunter tube is that was

488
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,560
there's gonna be a little bit harder
than you think there'll be an easy one

489
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:41,660
and a hard one so I know how to do a fox
hunt the ways that I mentioned earlier

490
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:47,640
okay so without boring you guys to too
much more I really would like to thank

491
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,080
you for coming to this really late at 8
p.m. talk especially on a Thursday night

492
00:43:52,080 --> 00:44:00,680
before even a longer day and
drinking ahead so so thank you all and

493
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:05,569
oh one one little other hinge for a
safer god that weird I was sponsored by

494
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:11,540
aluminum body okay that doesn't mean
anything to anybody here so don't worry

495
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:18,680
about it no finger not Leena okay so on
that note I'm gonna say thank you very

496
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,770
much for attending and I'm gonna stay up
here for questions or I'll be happy to

497
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:26,119
stand up here if you have any questions
you just want to dialogue about how much

498
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:29,480
you disagree with me or I'm boring or
some other fun things and maybe I'll

499
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:35,089
give you a couple of projects feel free
to go or come up whatever you want to do

500
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:39,369
I just thank you thank you guys

501
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:38,780
you
