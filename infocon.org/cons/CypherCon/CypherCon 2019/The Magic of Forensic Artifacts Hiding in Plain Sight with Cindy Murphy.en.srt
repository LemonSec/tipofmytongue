1
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,419
Welcome everybody. I'd like to just start
this out saying, you are not the typical

2
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:34,070
crowd who I speak to and I'm so happy
about that, it's refreshing. And one more thing that I

3
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,930
would like to ask, just because it's
personal curiosity and I'll preface it

4
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,320
by saying that I haven't been in law
enforcement for three years okay. So I'm

5
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:50,120
no longer sworn. How many people in this
room had ever had an inquiry from law

6
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:56,860
enforcement about their activities?  A few. OK.Cool.

7
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,320
[Question from audience.]

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,480
Well I'm talking about your technical activities.

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,080
Your, your curiosity with electronic
devices and computers specifically. Yeah

10
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,170
that's, that's what I'm talking about. There is this huge perception out there in the

11
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,830
world, that if you're at a hacker
conference, you're going to be surrounded

12
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,990
by people who are doing this for
nefarious purposes, right? Like that, that

13
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,070
you guys are out here trying to hack
things and steal people's money and

14
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,798
information and sell that on the dark
web and all of those things and... And

15
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,640
throughout my law enforcement career
because I grew up as a total geek in

16
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,799
high school and learning file systems on
my father's knee, it was always my

17
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:50,090
suspicion that that was just a load of
BS. And that, that when you go to a hacker

18
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,299
conference like the vast majority of
people are here just because they're

19
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:55,430
curious about how things work and they
want to know more.

20
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:01,869
Great, so. That is actually the secret to
my success in law enforcement. Is that

21
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:11,480
every time, and by the way I am among few
in law enforcement that I have had the

22
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:18,470
honor to identify and arrest a couple of
different DDoS suspects for major DDos

23
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,220
events and one for a major hacking event. That,

24
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,599
that actually went all the way to the US
Supreme Court and, and came through okay.

25
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,159
So it made some case law in this area. But
the secret to my success was talking,

26
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,410
right because, I'm not going to assume
ahead of time that their goal was bad

27
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,200
unless it was obvious and then I'm gonna
be kind of curious about what they did.

28
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,209
And how many people liked talking about doing something after they do it, right?

29
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,190
Like it's, it's pretty cool. We get to do
some cool stuff. The other secret to my

30
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:56,970
success honestly, is that I have hidden
in plain sight, my entire career. okay. I

31
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,590
have over 30 years In enforcement. Do I
look like a cop? I didn't even really

32
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:08,310
look like a cop when I was a cop, and
most of that is in Computer Crimes.  And I

33
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,230
can walk into a forensics conference, or
a security conference, or a hacker

34
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:19,440
conference and people just kind of
ignore me. Or they pay the wrong type

35
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,140
attention to me and then they don't get
very far because I was a cop for 30

36
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:30,869
years so... So it doesn't work out well. I will tell you when I walked into this conference, I

37
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,590
just sauntered up to the badge thing and
was waiting in line for my really cool

38
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:51,359
badge. While I was waiting
for that badge, two people cut right in front of me. The law

39
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:59,010
enforcement came out to me and I was like "follow the rules" So for 31 years I've

40
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,260
been in law enforcement. The last three I
have been in the civilian world and I

41
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,250
will tell you so far I'm really
preferring the civilian world. There's a

42
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,590
lot more freedom out there to follow my
curiosity and a lot more resources to do

43
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:20,130
the sorts of things I want to be doing.
But for 22 plus years, I've been doing

44
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:27,690
Computer Crimes in forensics and started
my career back when law enforcement did

45
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:33,190
not know crap about anything.
So really it was in the, and you could

46
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,700
argue that still the case in many
jurisdictions and I won't be there

47
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:44,440
arguing that too much with you. But it
was in the the mid to late nineties, back

48
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:51,520
when bulletin boards were a big thing and back in 1998 my dad gave me a one gigabyte hard

49
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,840
drive for Christmas and said that is the
last hard drive you'll ever use. It's one of

50
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,669
the few things he wasn't wrong about.
That has so much capacity you're never

51
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:06,970
gonna fill it up. And now we
regularly leave behind ram that's you

52
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:13,480
know, 16 times that big. Great so, there's
a problem there. So, I've done some pretty cool

53
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:22,510
hacking cases. Anybody here ever or be
acquainted with the TV truck Jeep from

54
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:31,210
the 414 freaking club? Them, yeah? Is
this someone you know? What's that? Okay I [Audience member].

55
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,479
was asking about one specifically
because I still have some questions I'd

56
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,790
like to ask somebody who knew him. Some
investigations just never end. That took

57
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,510
nine years of my life and if I
ever meet someone, I'd like to have a

58
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:51,039
beer in a conversation. But that case,
I've done a lot of DDoS cases. I've done

59
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,020
a lot of cases involving broken, smashed
devices that were smashed on purpose

60
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:04,599
hoping to keep cops out of them. And had
the opportunity to deal with some cases

61
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,190
where it felt like I was writing reports
that belonged in comic books, rather than

62
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:19,240
in police files. Doctor Chaos and Riot
Boy, wow. So, I've had supervisors read my

63
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,740
reports and go, what is this? Right? I
don't understand three-quarters of the

64
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,090
words in here and then I knew I needed
to go back and rewrite that report so

65
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:34,599
they can understand it. I'm a certified
computer forensic examiner. I testified

66
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,949
as an expert
on a number of a lot of occasions. North of

67
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:45,690
probably 200 at this point. In same federal courts and now in civil courts

68
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,940
as well. And I've had digital forensics
cases go to both the Wisconsin Supreme

69
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:57,569
Court and the US Supreme Court. And both
of those thankfully went in my view the

70
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:04,650
correct way. People can argue, but and
they did. I'm also a certified SANS

71
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,549
instructor and a course co-author of FOR585, although I'm not currently teaching

72
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,810
because my personal business has just
taken off to a point where I don't have

73
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,699
the time to dedicate to it right now. But
maybe someday I'll go back and continue

74
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:23,699
to do that. And I did my master's degree
in computer forensics at University

75
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:31,169
College Dublin. Earned that in 2011. It was a blended program, so some online and some

76
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:36,180
in country. One of the things my dad was
very right about, is if there's something

77
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,020
you want to do and something you have to
do and you can make those things come

78
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,570
together, it's a great way to live your
life. So I wanted the good Ireland, they

79
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,250
had a master's program in forensic
computing and cyber-crime. I knew that the

80
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,969
training programs that were available to
law enforcement in my area weren't

81
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:59,009
cutting it for me anymore, so I went
Ireland. And it's a great program if

82
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:08,580
anyone's looking for a good one. Um, so I'm going to start this talk with a picture, all

83
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:14,448
right. And it's not a new picture
obviously. This is called Flammarion and

84
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:21,389
this is a depiction of the guy who first
decided that the Earth probably wasn't

85
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:26,310
flat, it was round. And I like to think
about technology in these terms, right.

86
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,710
Like we don't know what's possible until
we pull that curtain aside and look

87
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:37,319
beyond it, at all of the things that are
possible out there. And the vast majority

88
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,729
of the world sometimes goes on thinking
that things aren't possible, even when

89
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,310
they're hearing that they are possible,
right?

90
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,859
Security RD report. No thank you, OK,
here's your rank somewhere. Great, like it's...

91
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:55,370
That could never happen to me. It's
not a possibility and then they get nailed.

92
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:02,149
So my first degree was in graphic arts.
I like to go back to graphic arts

93
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:08,540
because I think sometimes those pictures
do more for us to describe the way we

94
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,630
look at the world versus the way the rest of the world sees the world. It is a

95
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,430
world of possibilities out there. And
even in my field of digital forensics,

96
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:25,640
which is my preferred field, I'm getting
pushed into incident response and

97
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,569
security and some other places that are
less comfortable for me. But even in that

98
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,010
world, sometimes the way people see that
world is so black-and-white that they

99
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:38,060
forget about the possibilities. And so
when I say I'm happy to be in this room

100
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:44,060
talking to you, it's because people in
this room or more likely to have already

101
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,890
looked beyond that curtain, at what's
possible. And I would encourage you to

102
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:55,459
keep doing that. So... I want to talk about
ground truth, right. Like those things

103
00:09:55,459 --> 00:10:00,560
that we know are absolute in this world.
The things that we were taught to

104
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,149
believe as truth. And I want to start
out by saying after 30-plus years of law

105
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,649
enforcement, Oscar Wilde was right. The pure and simple truth is rarely pure and

106
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:17,510
never simple, right. There are always colors to the

107
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:23,270
grayscale. And there are always things
that challenge our beliefs about what is

108
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:28,189
true the question is are we willing to
go there and look at those things and

109
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,959
see where that possibility brings us or
are we gonna get stuck in what some

110
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:39,800
wonderful destiny true and I'm afraid
that for the vast majority of people we

111
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,359
get stuck with what people tell us it's
true and we stop testing the limits I

112
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,040
don't know how I used to see this this
is a game of giant Jenga played at the

113
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,120
Sands D Empire summit every year Jared
and I play a game actually we play more

114
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,990
like 5 or 6 but this is a perfect
again every piece is played all the way

115
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:03,389
to the top no pieces to go and you can
see the foundation down there is strong

116
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:06,990
and true and at the top that goes
towards tipping so again I saw this

117
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,399
great analogy greatly the further we go
out towards the edges the less stable

118
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:17,670
things become and that is actually the
area where I like to work in forensics

119
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,829
is wearing wearing the truth gets kind
of fuzzy the stuff that we were taught

120
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:28,560
to be true has some exceptions and I
like to explore those exceptions so what

121
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,779
am i doing I'm kind of hacking right
like that that's what what you guys do

122
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:37,980
so I just want to talk about a few how
many people have background in forensics

123
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,019
in this room a good number okay so for
the rest of you this isn't gonna be

124
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,699
anything that's going to be like totally
over your heads and for those of you in

125
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:50,639
forensics hopefully it won't be totally
earth-shaking but it'll be enough to

126
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,380
have you peeked through those curtains a
little bit we're going to talk about

127
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,100
imaging because we were told some
SuperDuper straightforward rules about

128
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,160
imaging about how when we do a full
physical image of a hard drive we go

129
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,240
from the first bit to the last bit and
we did every bit in between and that is

130
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,620
a good image if we have it my hash Mac
I'm gonna tell you why that's not true

131
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,149
and why we shouldn't believe it in wine
it's been common knowledge since 2012 we

132
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:24,089
just chosen to just kind of cover our
eyes and ignore it and I'm not talking

133
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:30,389
about firmware which I was so glad to
see these badges and to see that you

134
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:34,050
guys are dumping firmware I actually
added a couple of slides into this

135
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,800
presentation right out there in the
hallway about case that came in this

136
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:45,120
morning because it has to do with with
firmware and hardware and I want to talk

137
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,980
about hardware okay
because in forensics we sort of ignore

138
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,310
these things we sort of ignore firmware
and hardware we assume that they're

139
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:58,290
doing what they're supposed to do
according to the manufacturer and that

140
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,899
there's nothing
sneaky going on there behind the scenes

141
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:06,029
that we're not able to see same with
hardware and then I'm gonna talk about

142
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:11,070
what we do about it once we discover
that the earth isn't flat in forensics

143
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,360
right that there are some exceptions to
rules that we need to take into account

144
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,240
like if for 15 years I've been writing
police reports swearing in front of a

145
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,850
judge that I'm telling the truth the
whole truth and nothing but the truth

146
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:29,399
and then I find out that I'm not getting
every bit of a hard drive the next time

147
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,950
I testified what do I say right like I I
swear that I'm gonna tell the truth well

148
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:40,709
really that's not the truth the truth is
a little different from the fact that

149
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:44,160
we're just getting first to last these
are the slides I added does anybody know

150
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,949
what this is just off the top of your
head it's not point a sail skimmer

151
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:55,110
right so this was placed over a
point-of-sale device in order to capture

152
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,130
some credit-card information
we turned that sucker over we've seen

153
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,430
the back of the keypad we start to see
kind of a mess it's hard to see from

154
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:08,160
there so I'll make it bigger for you
that's where the brains live anybody

155
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,430
especially people who made these badge
is happy about the work that was done

156
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:17,310
here it's kind of a hack job right
minutes in the police in the least happy

157
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,569
sense of the word again a little bit
hard to see with the lights up but I'm

158
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,160
told that's the way to do the video here
so we'll let it go but what we see

159
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:33,089
circled in the middle is a little I
think 8 megabyte CMOS chip that's where

160
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:39,360
the data gets stored before it goes out
of this device via bluetooth so we get a

161
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,370
call Monday this week from another
forensics company and they say hey we

162
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:49,199
have called no less than 10 elapsed I've
sent out the information about this chip

163
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,130
I sent up pictures of this chip and
everybody says no sorry I'm eating chip

164
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,329
ups but we don't do that and I looked at
that I'm like it's just a CMOS chip like

165
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:03,449
why don't you do that like it's that's
probably the simplest scenario ok so

166
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:10,069
when you guys are working on
half the bag challenge right and you

167
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:13,909
look at the little chip on the back
you'll see that it's nearly identical

168
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:18,919
it's not the same naked model but you
will be dumping the firmware out of that

169
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,159
chip
so those ten forensics companies that

170
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:27,859
said no to this job that's super simple
you guys if you can accomplish this will

171
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:32,329
at least be able to do part of that work
and taking that chip off because it's

172
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:38,029
been secured by hot glue is not going to
be a super challenge and there are

173
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:44,269
readers for CMOS chips right so this is
not a hard job so when I said yeah it

174
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:47,479
shouldn't be too bad a challenge he's
like what do you mean he's like

175
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:53,149
everybody else said no and I'm like
about there's not much data on it it's a

176
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:58,759
simple chip we have readers we have all
of the information we need about how the

177
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:03,319
thing is laid out on this this shouldn't
be a challenge at all and it shouldn't

178
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:07,128
even be expensive he's like well if you
get data out of this one you can have

179
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:14,929
all of our typical like okay data so
bonus right bonus so this is a lesson in

180
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:18,409
why when somebody else looks at
something and they go that's a homemade

181
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:23,509
piece of I don't know and they probably
weren't looking to see which one of

182
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:27,799
those chips held the data or which one
of those might be a challenge because

183
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:33,858
there's nothing about that that's
complex it's just not made by Samsung or

184
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:42,489
by LG or by somebody else right and so
so you guys would be like oh yeah I mean

185
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:48,649
that's not a big deal let's go for it so
that's why I wanted to put this in here

186
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:54,259
so that you can see that in the real
world outside of conferences this sort

187
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:57,169
of work is out there to be done and
there are a lot of companies that are

188
00:16:57,169 --> 00:17:03,169
turning it down because they see it as -
as a carrot to do so that's the stuff

189
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:07,128
that makes my work fun now in law
enforcement I probably would have had to

190
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:11,750
send that chip up right because because
there aren't too many labs that will do

191
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,369
it but I do know of another one that
will Secret Service has allowed

192
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:23,458
so imaging as examples go in this ground
truth area and things that are playing

193
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,329
hiding in plain sight this imaging is
kind of an oldie but goodie

194
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:33,658
Todd Shipley in 2012 he's an old
forensics guy wrote the white paper

195
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:40,649
talking about our our imaging verbage
and what everybody was taught by a

196
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:45,178
national white crime Center and by the
FBI part team and by every other

197
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:49,649
training organization out there and said
hey we can't keep doing this because

198
00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:54,268
it's wrong I said yeah you're getting a
bit for bit image of the user

199
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:58,289
addressable areas of the drive but there
are all sorts of other pieces of

200
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:04,110
information you're not getting we gotta
stop saying this and by the way people

201
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:09,379
if they're smart could be hiding data in
those places that we're not getting so

202
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:15,240
back in 2012 I paid attention and I was
like whoo I I need to change what I'm

203
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,460
doing here because I don't want to miss
things and I don't want to be saying

204
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,879
things on the stand that aren't truth
right like I want to be doing the best I

205
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:28,199
can do so the myth here is that when we
create that drive image we're making a

206
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,809
full bid for the image and in reality
we're only getting a bit for the image

207
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:39,330
of the user addressable areas of that
device but we have these lovely tools

208
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,889
that allow us to take that image and get
a hash and match the hash afterwards

209
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:49,830
after after that validation or
verification process and and we have

210
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,549
planned people who are willing to say oh
I got everything we're good move forward

211
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:58,918
write the report it's it's easy and
simple it's easy and simple until you

212
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,870
start realizing that there are all sorts
of places in this drive the service

213
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:10,049
system area reserved areas servo
information post protected area firmware

214
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:15,570
all of these places on the drive that
you know the disk itself or within the

215
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:21,960
flash memory that can be altered by the
user and could have information that's

216
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,559
really important to a case so some of
this stuff our write blockers even

217
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,600
picked up on right so in this case we
have

218
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:35,949
a picture of a write blocker that I used
in a case where a long-term employee he

219
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:40,300
works for the company for 13 years
turned into his computer after he left

220
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,710
he worked remotely and they were like he
wiped the hard drive well he didn't wipe

221
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:50,200
it well maybe she you know reinstalled
Windows really waited it was a different

222
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,770
hard drive into that computer that had
only been powered up six times right so

223
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:58,690
he gave them back an intact computer it
just not the right hard drive so it had

224
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:03,790
only been powered up five times when I
got it but interestingly the write

225
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:09,100
blocker sees this serial number we were
to search that bit for bit image of that

226
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:14,560
hard drive or that serial number we
should be able to find it right should

227
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:20,649
be there it's not because it's not
stored in the user a celeriac stored

228
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:26,230
outside the user accessible area
so sometimes forensic examiners see this

229
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,100
stuff and they go okay well that's what
it says the harddrive serial number is I

230
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,209
want to verify that I'm gonna search my
image for it oops I can't find it and

231
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:38,710
they go I don't know maybe it's encoded
somehow and then they call up Ultra doc

232
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,970
or Tablo or whoever and they say where'd
that come from I can't find it on the

233
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:48,250
drive in and then ultra black or tableau
tableau sends them off to Tasha please

234
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:53,290
article and they go oh you know I just
pulled the curtain back and there's this

235
00:20:53,290 --> 00:21:00,399
whole new world hunter so that's out
there and it's it's certainly an area

236
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:07,030
that doesn't probably get enough
attention in terms of what can be

237
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:14,350
written to that area and what can be
done to manipulate the drive during

238
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:19,719
during the use of that hard drive so so
that's the number one example I want to

239
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,940
use for you the things that are hidden
in plain sight for us firmware myth

240
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,950
firmware doesn't really matter as long
as it works and the reality is from

241
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:35,620
where really freaking matters like it
matters all the time yes we want it to

242
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:40,790
be the stock firmware but some of the
most neat DX points right now are for

243
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:46,879
our exploits right so so firmware can be
used to turn on your computer even when

244
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,090
it's turned off and to access it at the
lowest levels and it used to be

245
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:58,429
available only to nation states but now
it's available to all of us if we just

246
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:03,860
go to WikiLeaks and download the
information and the tools so so it

247
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:09,679
becomes problematic right because those
those schools are now out there so one

248
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:15,560
example I like to use when I'm talking
to tops is that you know your so you

249
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:21,470
think about computer users in a certain
way farmers are having their own

250
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:26,060
firmware in their tractors okay so if
farmers are hacking their firmware in

251
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:34,120
order to avoid John Deere's man you know
mandated service times at once a year

252
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:40,399
then we ought to be aware of the fact
that anybody with the right knowledge

253
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,050
and tools can hack their own firmware so
it's something we have to pay attention

254
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:51,620
to firmware is everywhere I have this a
great pointer that I like to use when X

255
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,469
as an example
unfortunately Murphy's Law says the best

256
00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:04,040
review is not fully charged so so this
is this this is a pointer that does some

257
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,090
firmware tricks so I can point it at my
screen or I can point it at that screen

258
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:14,000
and it will show pointers either place
without a piece of a laser and it's

259
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,640
interacting with with that device little
Bluetooth magic or a little Wi-Fi magic

260
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:30,800
in between and you have you have a
really cool toy but USB keyboards

261
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:36,649
webcams sound cards graphic cards one
major place this comes up data recovery

262
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,800
data recovery company gillware started
as a native

263
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:45,500
company 1516 years ago one of the most
common things that comes in is people

264
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:53,450
who turn over to us they're 64 128
gigabyte USB devices that they bought

265
00:23:53,450 --> 00:24:00,920
off of ebay or amazon for 14 bucks right
and they go I got this huge USB I put 64

266
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,240
gigabytes of pictures on this and
there's nothing left what happened well

267
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,040
when you take it apart it's actually an
8 gigabyte chip right so you can't put

268
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,050
64 gigabytes in an 8 byte chip but I
think gigabyte check but you can change

269
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:20,540
the firmware on that 8 gigabyte chip to
make it show the user that gets a bigger

270
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:25,700
USB Drive so that you can make more
money so this is one very common way

271
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:33,140
that this happens it can also be used by
bad guys and I've had the great

272
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:38,050
opportunity to see it being used in
cases where reporters are being spied on

273
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:45,950
and where bad guys are using altered USB
firmware in order to create spy devices

274
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:53,510
so so watch those USB keys they're still
under imaging but GPS devices traffic

275
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,930
signals routers printers vehicles
everything's got firmware in it and we

276
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:04,100
can mess with all of that firmware and
make things do things other than they

277
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,149
were designed to do here's the next
picture I love to show looks like a

278
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,400
hacker doesn't it your traditional
happens

279
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:17,480
this is Trenton he works for me he's not
hacker he's actually a great coder but

280
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:23,330
what he's doing right there is
decrypting however many virtual machines

281
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:29,689
are there from trauma from a ransomware
case the problem is that we start

282
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,820
looking for you know very computer savvy
people and we should be looking for this

283
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,200
guy really the guy who figures out that
they can change that firmware in their

284
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:48,800
tractor or better yet the kid who from
the age of tiny decides hey those limits

285
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,899
they're not mine
somebody else's limits and I'm just

286
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:56,678
gonna keep pushing beyond them and
figure out how to make this thing do

287
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:03,130
what I want it to do so if we're not
looking for those people or add those

288
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,640
people and there's whole roomful of
those people here I'm pretty sure then

289
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,669
we're missing out on a lot why does it
matter it can be easily exploited it's

290
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:18,909
not designed for security it's small
it's fast to write we see meltdown

291
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:24,940
inspector and we're firmware in firmware
exploits the Intel from wherever ulnar

292
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:32,890
ability is is is out there and in use is
is actually a screenshot from a case I

293
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:38,789
pulled that out of unallocated space the
Intel Active management technology

294
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:47,250
screenshot and so so really if you got
that Intel chip and someone has can

295
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:53,169
remotely get into your computer even if
it's been turned off and in this case

296
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:56,710
they could also turn the power off on
you this person's computer was doing all

297
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:01,750
sorts of crazy stuff that and they
didn't know why and unfortunately they

298
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:09,640
were in a in a in a very large big name
company and that company was kind of

299
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:17,010
owned at the firmware level so it was
kind of an ugly mess I mean like

300
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:22,120
operating system firmware really has
easily update market mechanisms but you

301
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,969
can go out usually and find on Russian
or Chinese sites the software that you

302
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:32,289
need to interact with all sorts of
different firmware we can use it to help

303
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:36,940
us access devices that otherwise can't
be accessed and in the mobile forensics

304
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,649
field anybody playing with mobile
devices at all firmware can really help

305
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:46,059
us get into devices that are acting
right or that are under otherwise

306
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:51,590
inaccessible through through security
mechanisms so

307
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:58,730
it's definitely something to be to be
looking at hardware the myth is the

308
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:03,169
hardware doesn't really matter so long
as it works I don't know too many

309
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:07,820
forensics courses that ever talk about
hardware and firmware how they interact

310
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:13,549
together and how they in fact what we
see later on in reality hardware really

311
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:21,200
matters and it doesn't necessarily even
matter whether it works or not if you're

312
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,610
able to get that hardware to work then
then you're gonna be a better shape so

313
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,719
sometimes we just need to go there to
get around the problem the the picture

314
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:40,210
here on your left is a Qualcomm chip on
the phone this is the first chip off

315
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:46,639
chip back on case on never aware of so
go where we said hey we could take chips

316
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:52,758
off read them directly if we get in
cryptid data back we know that there's

317
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:58,159
several chips involved in that
encryption what if we put that chip back

318
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,379
on another phone and replaced chips -
could we get around some of that and the

319
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:07,580
answer is yes you can not going to work
with every phone but there are several

320
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:14,240
phones that we've had this process work
for so it's pretty cool next one is an

321
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,090
old SD card thing was broken off but in
in ways that we just so get around them

322
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:26,029
so I just did some spiderwire soldering
it got the the diagrams to get the right

323
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:31,580
connections and then did a physical read
of the data from that card reconstructed

324
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:38,480
it and got the data back on it and the
third one is a donor column next to an

325
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,799
evidence phone this is from a Chicago
homicide case Chicago PD homicide case

326
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:48,950
where a body was burned in a barrel
along with his phone and the person

327
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:55,690
obviously wasn't identifiable the phone
to look like a hockey puck but we got

328
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,840
probably 98% of the data back out of
that

329
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,590
including the guys last pictures and his
last communications and they were able

330
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,820
to identify the guy and solve their
homicide hardware mattered in that case

331
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:11,230
right like and many labs would just look
at that and go not a chance

332
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:16,149
I'll go through some more pictures of
that case in a little bit repairs and

333
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:20,049
replacement and reconfiguration can
solve some problems that other methods

334
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:26,200
can't you can go act these things all
you want with a write blocker and read

335
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,330
and read and greed but but sometimes we
have to go beyond that to get data out

336
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:37,779
of devices board spots chip swaps head
swaps for hard drives or board swap

337
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:43,619
phones can get us to dated it is
otherwise coated inaccessible

338
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:49,090
alternative input methods so you see the
iPad there that was a password-protected

339
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:54,070
I've had at one point but somebody left
accessibility options on and we were

340
00:30:54,070 --> 00:31:00,009
able to insert a keyboard and do some do
some hacking in order to get into that

341
00:31:00,009 --> 00:31:05,619
particular device and then I'm making
that one a little bit bigger this is an

342
00:31:05,619 --> 00:31:12,789
iPhone board we've sprayed it with some
well in this case we actually used the

343
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:19,179
the free spray right but you could use
your candid or upside down that way but

344
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:23,470
this was a foam that was stuck in a book
loop and iPhone stuck in a blue glue it

345
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:27,610
would come up it would overheat and it
would shut down if you spray it with

346
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:33,399
cold air as it's coming up and frost
everything it becomes obvious which

347
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:37,869
chips are the problem right and then you
swap out those components this phone

348
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:42,249
will work beautifully and it will move
all the way okay so most people would

349
00:31:42,249 --> 00:31:46,899
say that phone is a hockey puck I'm on
to the next phone that would be a

350
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:53,678
mistake because you will miss your
evidence great example so this is the

351
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,289
example that pulled me out of law
enforcement and into the private sector

352
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:07,480
so for probably the last ten years of my
career I had a lot of different people's

353
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,110
hey Cindy come work for us like there's
the amount of money wouldn't he said the

354
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,899
minute law enforcement there's all sorts
of stuff to be done out here

355
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:20,768
well then I went for a tour of Gilmer's
data recovery lab to talk to them to

356
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:23,799
consult with them about starting a
forensics business I wasn't going to be

357
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:29,200
involved in it I was just consulting
with them and walked through their data

358
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,809
recovery lab and a guy named Greg
introduced he was working on an SD card

359
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:38,740
that a wedding photographer had
accidentally reformatted after coming

360
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,820
back from Hawaii and shooting a
high-dollar celebrity wedding she was in

361
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:48,370
trouble
rage so so she sent this SD card in and

362
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:52,928
you reformat it any time we read this
with Windows what is it going to tell us

363
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:59,019
it's an empty card it's all zeroes I can
apply my write blockers and I can take

364
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:02,889
the physical image of that drive first
bit too last bit all I want and it is

365
00:33:02,889 --> 00:33:09,219
always going to show me all zeroes okay
in law enforcement if that had come to

366
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:15,519
me USB Drive SD card I put it on a write
blocker I preview it and it's all zeros

367
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,080
I'm on to the next piece of evidence and
I've worked Child Exploitation doses for

368
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:27,730
17 years okay so a lot of pieces of
evidence so I watched Greg that day I

369
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:34,269
happen to get lucky recovered 300 plus
images from an SD card that would read

370
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:41,320
all zeros what kind of magic is that
Christmas big wait like I'm supposed to

371
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,309
be an expert and you just did that and I
always thought the data recovery people

372
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:51,490
were just sort of forensics light right
it's not anything yes we have these

373
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:55,899
perceptions that we come into this
business with right that that data

374
00:33:55,899 --> 00:33:58,629
recovery people are just getting
people's data back it's just you know

375
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:03,580
what did they do we don't get that back
what's yeah so but this was some sort of

376
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:08,529
magic or I just like what wait like how
did you do that and how can I be

377
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:12,070
involved in doing that so then I started
to read more and learn more

378
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:16,600
about flash memory and Greg gave me and
I knew some of this like I had heard

379
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,850
academically a lot of this stuff but
until I saw it in action I didn't

380
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:27,429
realize you know how fooled I was about
about what was visible versus what was

381
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:31,719
it so we have the file system level our
software based it was just kind of reach

382
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:36,069
there and understanding through windows
through Linux through whatever you're

383
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,550
looking at it through an operating
system all you're going to get is that

384
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:47,170
level on these flash memory devices USB
devices thumb drives or flash memory or

385
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:51,430
even the Flex hard drive they have this
flash translation layer that just

386
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:55,330
basically sits there and says here's
what I want to show you and you're not

387
00:34:55,330 --> 00:35:00,670
seeing anything else okay and I like to
think of that as the wizard from The

388
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:05,950
Wizard of Oz do not look behind this
curtain right because everything back

389
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:10,330
here is stuff you no longer need to know
about I've been told to reformat this

390
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:16,930
drive so all you can see is eros but
underneath that lays both NAND flash

391
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:23,830
memory and that ROM and if you can
directly read that chip rather than

392
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:30,670
reading it through an SD card has data
on it until garbage collection and we're

393
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:36,160
leveling happened which is less common
with SD cards and USB devices than it is

394
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,310
with more modern hard drives but here we
are above that we see the logical level

395
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:46,990
and we can get a physical image of the
logical level okay so that's the part

396
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,810
that was screwing with my head because I
thought I'm getting a physical image of

397
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:54,460
this my tools tell me that my processors
tell me that my experience tells me that

398
00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:00,010
I've done this a hundred times but all
I'm getting is anything that the Wizard

399
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:05,020
of Oz tells me I can see if we're able
to go down below the five translation

400
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,320
layer then we can see the rest of it by
the way this looks

401
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,950
by person so there isn't a thing
underneath there that makes any sense

402
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:18,279
whatsoever two people were talking about
it it's so if I erase it the stuff at

403
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,870
the top is gone the stuff behind the
Wizards curtain though it is still there

404
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:27,009
and the worst thing people can do is
start messing with that device and

405
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,940
trying to get it back through a file
system read great like the worst thing

406
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,420
they can do is apply power to that and
start working on it

407
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,590
because you're not going to get to it
that way you have to take the chip off

408
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:44,880
do a directory and then put that million
piece puzzle back together again so

409
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,200
there's two avenues of extraction we can
either do a normal device interface so

410
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,270
you say that I am MCS do all of the
different interfaces we have or we can

411
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:59,140
do a directory to the flash memory of
one or more chips so in this case we're

412
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:03,160
seeing a more modern SSD where we have
removed all of the chips from that

413
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,750
device we will do directories on each
and every one of those chips and then we

414
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:15,010
will put together that five billion
piece jigsaw puzzle well it's hard it's

415
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:19,660
not easy and it takes a long time but if
you look underneath there with these

416
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:24,790
tools they have tools that help you to
figure out the patterns and to visualize

417
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:29,710
them and it reminds me of my graphic
arts days I go back and I kept oh that's

418
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:35,260
pretty it must be right and half the
time it's right so so if you can get the

419
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:40,540
right tools to do this work there is
data there and you can bring it back but

420
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:45,880
there's significant puzzles of building
involved in it so why don't we just do

421
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,040
it all the time wrecking like chip off
everything and I was there for a minute

422
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:57,060
it took I said slow down sitting that's
okay we can't do this all the time

423
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:04,690
because a lot of times those flash and
chips the NAND flash chips have industry

424
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:11,700
standard interfaces and they're not so
easy to read or the data layout is

425
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:18,640
proprietary or you have a tentacle ship
after chip by making model up firmware

426
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,790
and you
look underneath them the patterns are

427
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:24,750
all totally different great like they
haven't used a standard layout on the

428
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:31,650
memory underneath encryption is another
problem if that drive is encrypted then

429
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:38,940
the data underneath is also encrypted by
and the other issue here is that when

430
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:43,320
we're dealing with these larger drives
that have we're leveling and garbage

431
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,280
collection that happens on a really
regular basis and Trend commands and all

432
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,720
of that stuff that gets rid of a lot of
the data that we would be after anyway

433
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,180
pretty automatically and pretty quickly
so the the more modern devices the

434
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:01,470
larger devices there's actually less
chance of recovery from those although

435
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:05,819
we do find in spare area and over
provisioned area on these devices that

436
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:10,140
we're getting back lots of little files
and lots of versions or little files so

437
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:15,150
it's still not a possibility seems
straightforward but it's not really the

438
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:22,470
truth here is not simple and oh yeah
it can be physically destructive to the

439
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:27,149
original device like once you take those
tips off depending on the device putting

440
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:31,920
them back on is not necessarily going to
be a successful thing or if it is it may

441
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,970
not last for a long time so when I tell
you we're doing chip off chip bonds for

442
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:39,660
phones we are we're doing them on a
fairly regular basis now and having some

443
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,740
success with that but we're not handing
that back to the customer and saying hey

444
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,970
here's your LG phone go ahead and use it
right because that's a temporary fix for

445
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:54,689
us to get that data out and then to move
forward so let's talk about that oxide

446
00:39:54,690 --> 00:40:01,350
case just a little bit because I think
this is a great example 90% of law

447
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:06,450
enforcement lab we've got a phone in in
this condition would consider that phone

448
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:13,169
to be toast okay and they would not have
gone any further the phone itself was

449
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:18,630
melted to the point where getting the
micro sd card out was pretty difficult

450
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:22,950
and then once the SD card came out does
it look like it's in good condition so

451
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:28,649
anybody heard any rumors about how flash
memory is heat sensitive okay so all of

452
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:32,040
these issues should be a problem by the
way don't we

453
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:36,840
that last thing flash memory in my
experience is so tolerant to all sorts

454
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:44,730
of abuse like you can throw it under
salt water you can you can bury it for a

455
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:49,500
couple years you can burn it like this
and we're still able to do some pretty

456
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:54,510
amazing things to get data back it's a
pain in the butt and this one by the way

457
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:59,460
the whole lab would stomp like burning
plastic so this this was not a pleasant

458
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:04,470
case to work on so that if you ever have
a battery that looks like that it's time

459
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:09,629
to get that battery out of your building
okay that's that's my safety advice or

460
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,810
put it into an arson can and wait for it
to explode because it's going to at some

461
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:20,610
point so that's Mike's hands my kids are
one of our best chip off guys he did two

462
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:26,040
puffs work in Afghanistan and he's
really fabulous at it and has the

463
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:33,960
studies hands of anybody I know Mike did
the chip off on this basically took the

464
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:40,050
chip off of the donor board and we
replaced it on to the other board and

465
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:44,100
we're able to pull the data out so
that's the chip as it came off of the

466
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:50,299
board you can see the nice clean spot it
came out of great he'll clean that up

467
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,330
make it pretty
might have to reball it might have to

468
00:41:54,330 --> 00:42:00,690
resolder it depends on the job but then
we can get that data out so so we were

469
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:05,640
able to get back like most of the data
all of the name came off of that flash

470
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:11,120
memory chip and we were able to recreate
it we got like a 90% read on the SD card

471
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,880
so we didn't get everything and there
was a little bit of corruption there but

472
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,280
but what we got back helped to solve
that case so what do we do about all

473
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,500
this right because a lot of what I'm
talking about is those areas where we go

474
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,150
now is that's just forensics or is this
like science fiction right because this

475
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:34,800
is this where science meets fiction and
we're doing stuff that didn't used to be

476
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,540
considered to be possible and the thing
is the longer you're around

477
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:44,460
and I've been around for 30 plus years
in law enforcement and in 25 now or

478
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:49,440
something and doing forensic the longer
you are around the more you keep hearing

479
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,950
oh that stuff that used to be impossible
we're not doing like all the time right

480
00:42:52,950 --> 00:43:01,529
it's and and the thing is we moved
forward but often times we don't stop to

481
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:07,350
say hey that's no longer true
so stop writing it in your reports and

482
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:13,020
stop swearing to it every time on the
sand and this seems like a simple advice

483
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:17,850
though but I will tell you as someone
who's testified a number of times the

484
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:23,520
first time I write a report and then
testifying that notice isn't a complete

485
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,210
image of the hard drive this is an image
of the user addressable areas of hard

486
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:30,780
drive there was a very smart defense
attorney on the other side that said hey

487
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,430
Cindy
you and I've done a lot of cases

488
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:35,940
together and I've heard you testify lots
of times

489
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:40,800
why is this different than that other
one up like why did you use to get all

490
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,330
the data up and now you're not is there
something different about this partner

491
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:52,980
okay and then then you had that moment
where you go grab and you go no no I was

492
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,880
wrong all those other times then I
testify afraid like I was wrong

493
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,530
and that's a really hard thing to say
and the problem is you had to follow it

494
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:05,550
up and say I was wrong but not in a way
that substantially changes that case

495
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:10,500
right like I just learned that not only
can I get all of that these are

496
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,580
international stuff but there's other
stuff out there that I could get to if I

497
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:20,310
need to dig that deep and so what to do
about it is we can't be so afraid of

498
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:25,080
those moments where we go how do I
explain this that we just take the easy

499
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,560
route and say I'm not gonna explain it
I'm just gonna keep doing it the way

500
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,450
I've always done it and hope nobody else
notices because it's too hard right it's

501
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:38,250
not we just have to educate people as we
go and we have to keep learning and

502
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:43,970
reaching and growing and when our
understanding changes we have to be

503
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:49,649
humble enough to say I didn't know or I
don't know or

504
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:55,230
I was wrong and that actually gets
harder the more experience and expertise

505
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:59,579
you have under your belt the long run
around the more I know I don't know

506
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:04,079
crack right like that's that's a really
what it comes down to which makes me a

507
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,099
good forensics person because I'm always
questioning the stuff that I assume to

508
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:15,510
be true which is after all what science
is about right so so that's that's a

509
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:19,319
really the message I have for you about
those things that are hiding in plain

510
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:24,630
sight it's all around us like it's not
just in this conference room the stuff

511
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:30,059
that we believe to be true in forensics
is our understanding of forensics at

512
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:33,900
this point in time and like I've shown
you a few examples here but there are

513
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,549
many others of how that is just going to
expand and grow as time moves forward

514
00:45:38,549 --> 00:45:47,130
and technology changes and so any
questions I have with me I don't know

515
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:53,730
they're my new key cartoon room this was
a shirt that is from anonymous in

516
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:59,760
Amsterdam I was at math conference in
Amsterdam and a guy walked up to

517
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:07,819
meetings like Cindy I want you to have
this I'm like oh okay

518
00:46:08,359 --> 00:46:15,029
thanks I have a shirt and I said you
know I can't wear this at work right my

519
00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:20,339
boss would get sick but he said I'm
giving this to you to let you know that

520
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:25,279
some of us in Anonymous and he said this
in a really nice Amsterdam accent

521
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:32,130
appreciate the fact that you're keeping
our streets clean right he's like

522
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:37,349
because our goal when if we set out was
to make things right and there's so many

523
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:44,270
people who are out like ddossing you
know SeaWorld and children's hospitals

524
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:49,619
and I want you to know that we
appreciate the people who are policing

525
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:55,170
our streets too so I brought this shirt
to give away though so if anybody is a

526
00:46:55,170 --> 00:47:02,329
European large and has an interest
by the way your Kmart is smaller than a

527
00:47:02,329 --> 00:47:10,160
US large just for those of you who don't
know and try to figure out how to give

528
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,288
this shirt away but I think what I'm
going to do is give it to Mike and then

529
00:47:15,289 --> 00:47:19,189
halfway with who's not in the room
anymore because apparently you know he

530
00:47:19,189 --> 00:47:21,609
can't be bothered

531
00:47:22,209 --> 00:47:28,459
I'll get to Mike and and some challenge
in the next couple of days will include

532
00:47:28,459 --> 00:48:02,379
this shirt as well ok so that's your
bonus flash memory because if I do a

533
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:10,729
direct read of men's memory and Crowell
does it or some other company does it

534
00:48:10,729 --> 00:48:16,399
that direct read of Nan memory if we
were to hash it after the rebuild they

535
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,969
may rebuild it slightly different than I
do and it's not going to be the same

536
00:48:19,969 --> 00:48:22,630
like if we hit it the same that would be
amazing

537
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:28,130
so if it can be an issue and we just
have to be prepared to say you know sort

538
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:33,109
of like Ram is never the same cell
phones are going to be rarely the same

539
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:38,390
if you if you image them twice those
things that are actively changing are a

540
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:42,769
little bit different so the chain of
custody is usually of that physical

541
00:48:42,769 --> 00:48:46,879
device but it can be of the data too and
so it can get a little messy because

542
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:52,159
they can have one exhibit number four
for our dump and a different one for

543
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:55,880
another dome that people can spend hours
arguing which one's right even though

544
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,829
above the flash translation layer the
data is all exactly the same so you know

545
00:49:00,829 --> 00:49:05,479
that billion taste soft and the puzzle
that we're putting back together if we

546
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:08,689
rebuild some things differently
underneath it's not necessarily going to

547
00:49:08,689 --> 00:49:15,739
show above so so yeah it can be an issue
than this one that we we still are

548
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:19,849
working through I think honestly that's
part of the reason is collecting Ram

549
00:49:19,849 --> 00:49:25,609
stores like it doesn't say hi say this
is the correct image of brand because

550
00:49:25,609 --> 00:50:02,569
the next one I take will be different so
if we have a court order that allows us

551
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:07,130
to try to break that encryption or to
come up with a hardware or firmware

552
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:13,009
way around we may be able to get past it
it's it really depends on the makeup

553
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:18,979
model of phone though and the technology
involved this is really prevalent to buy

554
00:50:18,979 --> 00:50:23,718
phones right now great link if you are
affiliated with law enforcement you may

555
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:27,739
have the ability to get a great kini
extraction which is going to have more

556
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:32,329
data in it even for a password-protected
phone which they could break the

557
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:39,499
passwords on then you can from any
civilian available tool and so it's not

558
00:50:39,499 --> 00:50:42,490
an equal world out there in a lot of
different ways

559
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:48,810
and whether we can get around encryption
on a particular phone really depends on

560
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:53,320
the make and model of phone the version
of the operating system on that phone

561
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:58,780
and potentially other things as well
chipsets can make a difference Acushla

562
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:05,140
so every every phone is its own
individual problem we have time for one

563
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:18,040
more question have I ever been told to
stop my investigation man you know when

564
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:24,730
I retired did you get me just ask the
whole audience did anybody know her Jeep

565
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:27,400
me try if you did I'd like to have a
conversation with you

566
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:33,070
yeah no I have never been told to stop
an investigation usually what happens is

567
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:39,720
that so many other investigations come
in after it that it dies a natural death

568
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:46,930
so you know it's it's like you're a chef
at a 12 burner stove and everything's

569
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:52,569
burning over at once that thing that
requires your attention the least is

570
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:59,080
most likely to slide from your attention
so I've never been ordered to stop but I

571
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,890
usually follow the rules and I'm very
nice great I got I'm very nice to the

572
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:07,990
people I talk to whether their hope that
guy or a good guy and and I try to

573
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:18,939
follow rules and get permission
sometimes okay thanks

574
00:53:08,849 --> 00:53:16,600
you
