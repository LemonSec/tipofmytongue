1
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,220
Good evening ladies and gentlemen my
name is Joseph Cicero. I'll be presenting

2
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,070
spitting the hook, examining fishing bait
for enterprise protection. The, the

3
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,470
speaker for this room was unable to make
it on time so Mike asked if I could fill

4
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:39,470
in. So I have this presentation in the
can, as it were. I've never given it, I'm

5
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,339
not going to say it's going to be
polished. I hope you take away something

6
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:50,300
from it. I told him it's presentable. If
you deal with fishing it at all, I hope

7
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,649
you get something out of it. If you don't
deal with fishing very much or a little

8
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:58,970
bit, hopefully parts of the presentation
will, will help you out with that.

9
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:04,699
All right, Who am I? I'm Joe Cicero. I'm
currently a senior security engineer. In

10
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:09,710
the past, I've been a defense forensic
expert, so along the lines of forensics

11
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:16,580
for this CypherCon, it's a good talk.
I've been an instructor, speaker, lecturer,

12
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,390
security researcher, programmer, columnist, Network administer, I've held all

13
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,729
the jobs so. I love what I do though now,
as the senior security engineer l love it.

14
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:29,990
So why didn't I tell you where I work? How
many of you are familiar with this?

15
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,770
You've been scraped breach? Hands in the
air if you can, if you're familiar with

16
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,810
that. All right so, I'm being recorded
right now. I don't want to become a

17
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:45,740
target for my employer. So I don't
publish that. If you go out, you link with

18
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,060
me on LinkedIn, you will find that I work
for undisclosed. And it's always funny

19
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,479
when I get somebody communicating to me, "hey I'd like to talk

20
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:57,409
to you about your work at undisclosed". I
know that, well that's somebody's

21
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,790
fishing me there. Okay so a quick
schedule of what I want to do tonight.

22
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,860
I'm gonna do a quick survey. I'm gonna, a
lot of this presentation is for, is

23
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:13,489
designed around your ability to go back
to your organization and know what can I

24
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:19,640
do to teach my employees. What can I do
to teach my, my service desk or my, my

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:26,029
help desk from a triage perspective on
phishing emails. What can I do

26
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,849
or my analysts do and then
how do I react after that? So when we're

27
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:37,599
talking about all of the detailed
structure, what can you do once you have

28
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,929
all the information. All right. So quick
survey. Hand in the air if you can

29
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,819
identify phishing email. Just put your
hand in the air if you can identify

30
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:53,018
phishing email. And then look at the
screen. That's for a different screen,

31
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:56,110
that's, let's go ahead put your hand in the aiir. That's for something else. Put you

32
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,110
down, now I got everybody. Go ahead, put
your hand in the air. That's, that, that,

33
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,790
okay fine. Nothing, whatever, go ahead. All
right so, I asked you that you put your

34
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:13,000
hand up, the screen said don't do it. This
is exactly what happens with a phish with

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,760
your employee. They got an email,
it looks legit to them, they don't know

36
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,290
the indicators to look at, they're
clicking links, they're replying right?

37
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,209
That's what's going on. So, one of the
things I like to cover with the

38
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:33,609
employees is the red flag concept,
all right? Phishing tactics work because

39
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:36,730
the phisher's do things that in phishing
emails that you'll see in legitimate

40
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,470
emails. You get an invoice in a
legitimate email, you get an invoice in a

41
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:47,349
phish. You click links and emails, you
click links in phish. So the, the phish

42
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:53,858
that we're seeing on a large-scale basis
are very much what you would see in real

43
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,730
life. They're, there for each indicator,
every time you say well look for this,

44
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,660
look for this, look for this, you have to
tell them it's a red flag. Look at the

45
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,980
email address, does the email address
make sense? If it doesn't, that's a red

46
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,899
flag. Look at the subject. Does the
subject make sense? If it doesn't, that's

47
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,760
a red flag. And the idea here is that
numerous red flags, you go to your

48
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,180
employees, say look, if you have five or
six red flags, that's when you sit back

49
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,910
and you say all right something's wrong
with this, I need to send this to

50
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,750
somebody else to analyze before I go
clicking on a link. So that's the red

51
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:32,889
flag concept. All right, some statistics. I
love dealing with statistics. So 91% of

52
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:38,140
phishing attacks are displayed or
display name spoofs. So you have three

53
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,729
parts of an email address. You've got the
display name,

54
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:47,039
you got the email name and you have the
domain name. And 91% of the emails out

55
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:52,979
there are display name spoofs. Because
the bad guys know when they send you an

56
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:57,419
email and you look at it, the chances are
you're not gonna look at the email and

57
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:02,400
you're not gonna look at the domain name.
If it came from the CEO's name. Oh the

58
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,549
CEOs communicating with me, I need to
reply. So knowing that, one of the things

59
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,110
that you absolutely want to communicate
to your employees is, we start by looking

60
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,740
at the display name. How many of you work for an organization that gets a flag

61
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,860
right. A message banner that says this is
an external email. And how many of you

62
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,509
have had people fail with the flag that
says this is an external email? Guy right,

63
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:32,669
right. Because they become immune to it.
If it's got the flag, the next step you

64
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:38,219
look at is, what's the, what's the display
name? If the display name makes sense, we

65
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:41,520
go to the email name, if the email name
looks, make sense you go to the domain

66
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:49,469
name. And 91 percent of your problems
stop if your employees do that. All right,

67
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:53,129
display name spoofing. Here, here's a
display name spoof right? Dan Macmillan

68
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:57,870
in red. We got Dan Macmillan, but it came
from Ralph Jones at mailiinaator.com,

69
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,180
that's the display name. Anyone typically
can change the display name, and I have

70
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,909
that typically in star, we'll talk about
that later. But if, if you have a gmail

71
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:12,779
account, I believe Gmail allows you to
change the display name every six months?

72
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,259
Maybe it's every three months, every
quarter? So anybody can do this. You can

73
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,180
make the display name whatever you want
and this leads to CEO fraud emails.

74
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,149
Because they get an email address, they
make it you know, CEO at mailinator.com

75
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:30,870
and they say alright, I'm gonna go
after your organization, so I'm gonna

76
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,180
make that Dan Macmillan. All of a sudden
you have that. Employees that are in a

77
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,249
hurry will overlook this. How many of you
deal with BYOD? BYOD or small devices

78
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:48,959
right? Here's a problem. Because if you
allow an iPhone and you allow Android

79
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,420
and you're using outlook inside or some
other client

80
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,340
inside your, your organization, you have
to teach this three different ways. You

81
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,849
have to provide your employees three
different ways to look at it and say

82
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:09,350
okay, on an iPhone you won't ever see the
email name or the domain name. But if it

83
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:15,170
didn't come from your organization,
it'll be colored in red. In Android, it

84
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,220
will show you the display name and the
email name and the domain name. And then

85
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,640
depending upon how you have your
your-your-your client software

86
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,930
configured, it might display that.
Hackers can reuse email accounts and

87
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,440
numerous attacks, there's no cost or
little time and little effort.

88
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,150
So, as I massage this presentation and
get it better and better and better, one

89
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:40,190
of the things I absolutely want to talk
about is making it expensive for the bad

90
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:46,960
guy. As a whole, the security industry is
not making it expensive for the bad guy.

91
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,239
If you make it expensive. If you get
something from a gmail account and you

92
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,770
say I'm blocking that gmail account, and
now my organization is taken care of. You

93
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,659
haven't communicated to Gmail that this
account is being used in CEO fraud or

94
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,090
some type of phishing attack. And now
gmail is not taking that account away.

95
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:13,340
When it gets harder and harder and
harder for the bad guy or gal, to be able

96
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,099
to do this, you're gonna make it more
expensive, they're gonna go after

97
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,200
somebody else. So I want to enlist you
into moving forward with a lot of those

98
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,060
tactics as you go forward, all right.
Phisher Tactics. So here's the Phisher

99
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,370
tactic right? We've got hacker tactic
place fake, reply information within the

100
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:38,630
body of the email. So I ran into a phish
that came in. The account had been

101
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,710
compromise,d they stole somebody's email
account. I see this all the time with

102
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,870
them, with not free emails, but like your
AT&T account or your Comcast account.

103
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,920
Right, your home account. Somebody has
taken somebody else's home account away

104
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,099
and they're going after your
organization with it, because that

105
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:01,730
accounts not going to be flagged. The
tactic was to place fake information in

106
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,670
the subject. Now if you look, I don't know
if I have the zoomed or not. Yeah here we

107
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:12,079
go. All right, it's coming from Larry, but they pasted into the body of

108
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:19,490
the email from Dan McMillan. So where
does your eyes go as the user that

109
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:25,990
receive this email? Oh this coming from
Dan my boss. Not! It's coming from Larry.

110
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,770
So this is a tactic that you have to be
aware of and you have to communicate to

111
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:37,699
people, right? Didn't come from Larry your
actual Larry. It came from Larry, not

112
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,700
actually from the boss, so this is a
tactic you want to be training your

113
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,520
employees and your service desk, help desk, whatever to be looking for. All right.

114
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,870
Email name spoofing. This might get a
little harder right? If you're dealing

115
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,970
with a free online account, that's not,
it's not hard. Providing that name exists.

116
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,710
Anybody can go out, believe it or not AOL
is still around. You can go out to AOL.com,

117
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,100
you get yourself an AOL email
address and you can have anything you

118
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,040
want, because nobody uses AOL. So here we have a dome a display name spoofed and

119
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,290
an email address spoofed but the domain
name is still wrong your employee gets

120
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:20,329
this its CEO fraud dan McMillan's your
CEO all of a sudden they're checking one

121
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:25,850
they're checking two they check three
the domain name is is bad and 91% of

122
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:31,340
this you take care of your problem here
but they have to be able to get that

123
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,090
address so anyone can create an email on
free sites additional check that

124
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,110
employees should be taking hackers can
reuse an email account in numerous

125
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,490
attacks or they can't so this is the
important thing about setting up the bad

126
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:49,700
guy setting up an email account that has
the email name they can only use it

127
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,170
against you now how many of you keep
track of indicator of compromises or

128
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,579
threat intelligence any threat Intel
people in the art so very important

129
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,500
great job one of the things that I want
to do is keep track of this because this

130
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,240
show shows a little more sophistication
on the bad guy shot job so when I'm

131
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,440
keeping track of my threat Intel one of
the things I'm marking off is did it

132
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,010
display that did it didn't change the
display name because that's cheap and

133
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,360
they can reuse that account but did they
spoof the email

134
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,390
now if the email name is spooked that
took a little bit more they can't reuse

135
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,100
that account that account is only going
to be used against my organization so

136
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,240
I've increased it they can't reuse that
account there's still probably no cost

137
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,380
there's a little bit more time and
there's a little bit more effort so this

138
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,960
is costing them more and you want you
want the you want them a higher cost so

139
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:49,860
I went out and I wanted to find all
right that is does Dan Macmillan can I

140
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,880
get that email sure I can get that at
group mail comm so very easy I can go

141
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:02,010
get that free email Fisher tactic so
here's a tactic that I see being used

142
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:07,380
regularly it's where they did not change
the email address name notice that this

143
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:12,330
email address name is CEO mail so Dan
McMillan's my C's not my CEO but if he

144
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:17,280
were my CEO here's my CEO Dan McHale and
I can spoof that I can change that a

145
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,770
hundred times a day if I want but I
can't change that email name so here's

146
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:30,030
somebody who didn't use a whole lot of
effort to go after the organization all

147
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,000
right domain name spoofing now we're
talking about something that's going to

148
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,040
be a little bit more expensive so here
we have Dan Macmillan they've spoofed

149
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,380
the display name
they've spoofed the email name and

150
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:49,410
instead of Sam Mart we have Sam and na
rt.com so now they're trying to dis

151
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:57,150
they're trying to spoof the domain name
anybody can purchase a domain name right

152
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:07,100
now I'm seeing a lot of dot infos dot
clubs why anybody it's

153
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:13,730
it's a new top-level domain but why are
they using info and club that's true

154
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,980
what somebody said it yeah there are
dollar ninety-nine all right so once

155
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,660
again you have somebody who's buying a
domain that's gonna go into my threat

156
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,310
Intel okay they didn't bother with a
calm which might have cost them $7.99

157
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:33,770
they bought an info or a club I still
want to shut that down because shutting

158
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:39,110
it down cost them two bucks now they got
to go buy it again additional checks

159
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,930
that employees should make once again
we're checking the display name we're

160
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,310
checking the domain or the the email
name and we're checking the domain name

161
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:51,260
hackers can't reuse a domain name they
can't use it numerous attacks Sam n na

162
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,330
RT is only gonna work against Sam Mart
and unless it's generic in nature like

163
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:02,690
Verizon dot uk' it's more cost it's more
time and it's more effort so more things

164
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:07,070
that I want to put into my threat Intel
so I wanted to go out and see what type

165
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:14,570
of examples I could get here I could get
Sam Mart - mail.com this is something

166
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:21,020
I'm seeing a lot more of and it's it's
it's it ends up being a lot of false

167
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:27,130
positives how many of you have seen
subdomains or domains with CDN in them

168
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:32,780
CDN content delivery network so all of a
sudden I have a domain that I'm blocking

169
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,709
because it's not on a whitelist that's
being blocked I'm looking at it it's got

170
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:42,710
CDN in it and I have to go verify that
this domain is actually owned by the

171
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:49,220
same organization that has the regular
domain a couple of weeks ago I had one

172
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:56,450
where I contacted the organization said
I'm seeing this domain I think it ended

173
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,600
in dot stream
so another dumbest thing in the world

174
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,000
they ever did was come up with all these
new top-level domains

175
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,710
it was the domain dot stream puts me on
high alert

176
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:12,980
what is this contact the VP of Marketing
of the organization do you own this

177
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,720
domain what was her answer that's
exactly right

178
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,150
I don't know I'll have to get back to
you

179
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,699
they got back to me yes they own that
yes that's where they're putting their

180
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,730
streaming content yay I can allow that
all right

181
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,270
but that's the type of problem you're
gonna end up from a security engineer

182
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,829
perspective with false positives
all right subject trigger words again we

183
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,400
haven't even moved to the Service Desk
or they or the high-end analysis we're

184
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,050
still talking about things that I would
tell your employees to have to do

185
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:46,640
subject can take contain trigger words
lots of times effective because

186
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,140
marketing emails and legitimate emails
do this also hurry your account might be

187
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:57,560
suspended I see that as many times in a
legitimate email as I do in a phishing

188
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,300
email it invokes a sense of urgency
curiosity examples invoice Bo you know

189
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,140
if you get an email with invoice in the
subject

190
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,460
do you sell invoices that means do you
pay invoices do you take care of

191
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,190
invoices if you don't that's a
conversation you have with your

192
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,700
employees about it maybe we don't need
to be dealing with this email that

193
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,800
that's a red flag right away alert
warning attention etc all right so

194
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:28,609
phishing emails that invoke fear urgency
get the most clicks all right same thing

195
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:32,930
in the body though we've now we've told
them you get an email I want to check in

196
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,620
the display name I want you checking the
email name I want to check in the domain

197
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,060
name i watch check in the subject for
all these red flags now let's take a

198
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,130
look at the body in 2018 less is more
increase in minimal verbage emails hand

199
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:51,950
in the air if you have seen blank emails
coming to your organization nothing in

200
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:56,990
them great hand in the air if you have
short little emails like are you

201
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,730
available there say everybody I always
say these don't and our employees are

202
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:07,430
falling for them all right so the new it
used to be that they would have the

203
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,150
Bible in there right it was all and it
was all broken English and you could you

204
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:17,209
could tell in an instant but the new
tactic is we send you nothing or we send

205
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:24,260
you very little and we it's hard to make
a determination no hey are you available

206
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:31,240
yeah I'm available you get that on your
iPhone and you have very little

207
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:39,530
photo way to tell that that's a bad
email and your users are clicking it and

208
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,530
replying yet they're busy our users are
busy all right

209
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:47,480
generic versus specific salutation this
really depends so this is more things

210
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,690
that go into your indicators of
compromise or your or your threat

211
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:55,250
intelligence spreadsheet did they use a
generic hey are you available or did

212
00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:00,020
they say hey sue are you available
because now you've had somebody who's

213
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,820
taken the time to research you're the
individual that they sent this email and

214
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:10,580
they have an internal name they know who
they're sending this to that's more

215
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:15,050
information you're dealing with a more
sophisticated attacker so you want to

216
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,230
make sure that you get that in your
threat in town may contain the same

217
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,200
trigger words in the subject so we have
our users looking for that we have them

218
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,960
looking for spelling errors good story
an intern that worked for me sent me a

219
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,170
fish he received said look at this one
too spelling errors in it I laughed so I

220
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:38,030
took that I like analyzing things i when
I go home and I analyze things so I took

221
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,879
that and I analyzed that sorry I'm gonna
I'm gonna click the link I'm gonna go to

222
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,670
it while I went to it and it was his
college sending him a phishing email

223
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:52,040
that was a test and he had and so I just
failed the test for because I visited

224
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:59,540
the link at the end of the link was okay
a code and if I changed the code I

225
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,070
failed for other students so uh so I
failed for three or four other people

226
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,439
and then I sent him an email said by the
way enough other people fail this too

227
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:15,650
okay but when you see these emails come
in now what you're seeing with the short

228
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:20,900
small amount that's inside the email is
not a lot of spelling errors not a lot

229
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:27,050
of problems with that so we can't use
that as a trigger any more may contain

230
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:33,680
shortened URLs like bitly google and
many others right I'm trying to the uto

231
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:39,980
is probably the shortest one I've seen
may contain URL to hacked sites we're

232
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,510
going to cover that a little bit
URLs that us to sites that do metal

233
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:49,340
Durex so this is a new tactic I've seen
where they send you to a site and that

234
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:54,889
site makes a determination about who you
are where you're coming from what

235
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,900
browser you're using so they can send
you to a different site that may have a

236
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:05,030
vulnerability for that specific browser
or operating system may contain fake

237
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:09,290
attachments and may look perfect so once
again all the previous checks I

238
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,940
discussed plus these things it would be
what I am communicating to my employees

239
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,560
these are the checks I want you to make
these are things that they can tell all

240
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,530
right so here's a nice little short one
do you have a minute hey are you a

241
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:25,940
fellow I need so I need you to take care
of something for me ASAP oh you gotta

242
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,680
have that ASAP in there right did that
come from Dan McMillan no it came from a

243
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:36,590
display name spoof Dan McMillan at CEO
mail at group mail com didn't come from

244
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:46,639
my organization no one should have
replied to that zoom in for okay Fisher

245
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,950
tactic blank email for those of you who
have received a blank email there were a

246
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:57,110
few hands in the air how did you analyze
it what did you say about it did you

247
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:04,909
block the user is it a mistake or does
it have a 1 pixel image in it that just

248
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:10,460
went back and told whoever sent that
email the operating system the browser

249
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:16,190
the client email this all exists for
free you can go out onto the internet

250
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:20,750
you can get yourself a one pixel image
that you can put into an email that you

251
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,590
can send to somebody and you'll get all
that information back I wish I had the

252
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:30,919
screenshots of it when I first ran the
test I looked at it and it said somebody

253
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:39,190
in Chris Google in Cupertino yeah
somebody

254
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:45,340
alright so wasn't that it was Google
where's Google I have some what's that

255
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,679
okay yeah somewhere in California so it
showed my email being opened up in

256
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:57,110
California and then at my house and when
I looked at that I went you know that's

257
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:01,159
one of those
oh my god moments and then I realized

258
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,240
that was using Google and Google reai
new Google was this is all a test

259
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,710
account I know Google's reading my email
but I've never seen it done so if you

260
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,040
ever go out there and create one of
those one pixel images google it you'll

261
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,470
find somebody that will do message
tracking versus via an image and you

262
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:23,000
have a gmail account you will see Google
open and read your email and then send

263
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,080
it to you I have if you if you LinkedIn
with me you have an article out on

264
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,820
LinkedIn that shows it okay so that one
of the other tactics that I was talking

265
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,168
about is the shortened URLs so I don't
know if you're aware of it but there are

266
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:41,090
websites that you can put a shortened
URL in and it tells you where you can go

267
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:47,120
so when we get to the as a as an
examiner as an analyst how would you

268
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,840
handle this knowing where it goes there
are websites that will do that this

269
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:57,860
happens to be a Proofpoint rewriting a
URL the URL it's rewriting is a bitly

270
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:03,770
and the reason the hacker the bad guy
did this was so that the actual URL they

271
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:08,240
were using would not be captured by
Proofpoint right unless you're blocking

272
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,980
bitly which would be a very difficult
thing in this day and age to do this

273
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,890
link is going to get clicked it's going
to your proof point or whatever you're

274
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,870
using for for analysis if it's not
actually visiting the link and finding

275
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:25,729
out where that link ends up you're
you're vulnerable all right this is a

276
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,780
great one so I don't know how many of
you are familiar with one our site fixed

277
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:35,330
comm by the way I'm not uh I'm not
recommending you go to any of these

278
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,860
sites so when I went to this site I was
on my system it was a secured system I

279
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,959
was doing some testing this particular
site I have not analyzed so I can't tell

280
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,520
you this is safe but I went out there I
did search and I found that this all

281
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:57,110
harf un com slash King HTML had
malicious redirects into Faceman all

282
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:03,799
right so the important part of this
screen is 2018 11 19 at 2244 so let's

283
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:09,629
just remember 11 19
what is that November 19th so then I

284
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,490
went out to how many of you are familiar
with virustotal calm I would hope ever

285
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,789
all is alright virustotal
is a website think it's owned by Google

286
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:24,450
it's safe that you can upload an
executable or any any file you can

287
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:29,309
upload a file to it or you can tell it
tell me what you know about this URL and

288
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:36,360
it will scan it with 69 different AV
products and it will tell you whether or

289
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:44,549
not it's bad and so you'll see over here
zero of 69 found that are all harf young

290
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:54,059
comm / king - tml was bad 69 AV products
are saying have at it go to that site

291
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:59,908
you got no problem however if you look
at the last analysis date on this you'll

292
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:06,510
see it's at 12:23 so this is how many
days after the other site said this is

293
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:11,908
an infected site that google is there
yeah a virus total is telling you you

294
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:17,190
got no problem that should tell you
thank you that you just started who that

295
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:24,630
should tell you how weak AV is all right
AV is not your friend you cannot trust

296
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,549
it
it should also tell you those of you

297
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:31,080
that are doing threat intelligence and
using this and I you I use it I use

298
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,908
virustotal all the time because a virus
total comes back and tells me 15 sites

299
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:42,409
say it's malicious I'm done but if it
tells me zero out of 69 that's nothing

300
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:49,649
anybody can beat this so I have to move
forward alright so those of you familiar

301
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:52,739
with thumb
Webroot bright cloud so after that I

302
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,789
went out to web Rubright cloud I said
what's the reputation of them all are

303
00:25:55,789 --> 00:26:02,340
few calm and you'll see is 96 out of 100
oh that sounds like a great site so part

304
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,870
of the threat Intel that I'm going to be
documenting is all this information how

305
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:12,178
am I going to use that I'm gonna go to
my management and I'm going to say 69 80

306
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:17,039
vendors didn't catch this what a bright
bright top said this was safe yet my

307
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,210
analysis
shows it's not that's that means we have

308
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:26,929
to have these different vectors
protected in some way shape or form Oh

309
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:31,409
Fisher tactic when you open the
attachment it's actually a PDF file made

310
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:35,759
to appear like an error message anybody
seen this one so your user gets an email

311
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,230
with an attachment they open up the
attachment the attachment says well hi

312
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:46,259
there they click that and it contains
instructions for opening the document

313
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:53,029
Excel but it's actually a link to a
website unless you're doing some type of

314
00:26:53,029 --> 00:27:00,659
advanced analysis sandboxing is what we
would call it of your emails coming in

315
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:05,340
your users going to end up getting to
this they're going to that site and

316
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,330
depending upon one on that what's on
that site you may be maybe getting

317
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:14,490
infected another example of these PDF
documents put on pretense that you need

318
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:19,620
to sign in to an online storage provider
Dropbox to access your document Dropbox

319
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:26,549
I freaking hate it how many of us could
do business without it right so Dropbox

320
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:30,330
is one of those things that
organizations just say yeah we use

321
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:34,470
Dropbox we use Dropbox well that's why
the bad guys are using them clicking the

322
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,889
link takes you to Dropbox login page
which gives you options to sign in using

323
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:45,658
your Google outlook Yahoo AOL office 365
or other email right so if you ever see

324
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:51,179
this you capture a screenshot of it and
you show it to your employees and say if

325
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:58,080
you ever see this it's bad no site is
ever going to say by the way you can log

326
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,980
in and get your document using any
credential you want to give me that's

327
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,960
just ain't gonna happen
all right so new Fisher tactic as I

328
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,899
talked about earlier is fake attachments
so you'll see in this particular email

329
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:16,620
that the attachment that's right
underneath the email a name there that's

330
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:22,439
a real attachment but if it's under the
the verbage if it's under the text I

331
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,919
actually this one's reversed you got to
know what you're using so in this

332
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,620
particular one a fake attachment is on
top and a real

333
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,969
it is down at the bottom this must be
Google client or something so depending

334
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:41,960
upon how your client email program
handles attachments you may see the

335
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,920
attachment as an image in the bottom is
fake but an attachment a real

336
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,750
attachments up here at the top you have
to train your users on that because

337
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,830
they're gonna look at their say oh I
expect to get this email here's the

338
00:28:54,830 --> 00:29:01,550
attachment they click it boom they're
out to the to the malicious site all

339
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:06,889
right so that's that's the training that
I would do with the employees and that

340
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:11,390
made you you may have to adjust that
some but that there's nothing complex

341
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,620
about that and you may have to do it
regularly for them to be able to get a

342
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,229
hold of it
what's the analysis that I would having

343
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:22,730
depending upon the level of your service
desk or your security analyst or your

344
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,610
security engineer doing well one of the
first things that we're going to want to

345
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,580
do is take a look at the header so those
of you don't know that that's a header

346
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,290
header comes in the email how do you see
a header and outlook this presentation

347
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:37,159
by the way was for non techie people so
I would expect you guys would be able to

348
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,470
Google how do I look at my header and
figure it out

349
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:45,020
all right file properties that would
show you your header and in Outlook

350
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,350
what's in a header that you might want
to know about well the first thing would

351
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:52,040
be the SPF do we have any email
administrators if I say it wrong please

352
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,760
let me know I am NOT an email
administrator like a lot of this stuff I

353
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,309
know enough to be dangerous sender
policy framework the email might come

354
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:07,760
with an SPF check this is basically and
if there was an email administrator they

355
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,220
could tell me I think you get 10 entries
in your SPF check so if your marketing

356
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,370
department you're big enough to have a
marketing department and the marketing

357
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,928
department wants to use what's that
company that they send out emails with

358
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:24,080
thank you Kasich on that piece of crap
no I'm just joking

359
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,820
all right can't they use Constant
Contact to send emails on your company's

360
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:34,220
behalf but the marketing department
doesn't go to IT and say I need Constant

361
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:39,710
Contact to be in the SPF record then
every email that Constant Contact sends

362
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,030
out
going to get crapped on because it's

363
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:46,170
gonna fail the SPF check this
organization is not authorized to send

364
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:51,630
email for your organization that's what
an SPF check is so if you have SPF setup

365
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,670
and an organization is sending emails on
your behalf you get a nice little pass

366
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:01,800
and a lot of the websites dkim alright
so should should be instead considered a

367
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,460
method to verify that the message
contents are trustworthy meaning that

368
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,270
they weren't changed from the moment the
message left the initial mail server so

369
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:13,950
we can do a decal you can look in the
header and you can see was a dkim check

370
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:18,360
performed and if it was and the SPF
check was performed you could say all

371
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,800
right came from an authorised place and
it wasn't modified on the way to me

372
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:28,470
yeh Demark domain message authentication
reporting and conformance policy allows

373
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,370
a sender to indicate that their messages
are protected by SPF and DKIM tells the

374
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:36,360
receiver what to do if neither of those
author content ocation methods past such

375
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,320
as junk or reject the message so this is
this is in human speak what the d mark

376
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:49,250
is i get an email from you i check d
mark d mark tells me if the SPF fails

377
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:56,940
ignore the message if the SPF passes
allow the message if the SPF fails allow

378
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:02,340
the message if the DK dkim fails allow
the message so it's a way for the

379
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,600
recipient me getting your email to know
what to do with your email when these

380
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,860
other things fail everybody kind of get
it I want to know that stuff so if I'm

381
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,429
looking in the head alright I'm not
going to go through line by line

382
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:19,920
analyzing header I don't do it so here
are some websites that you can use that

383
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:28,790
would allow you to check those for SPF
and DKIM and d mark once again I'm not

384
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:33,690
I'm not guaranteeing that these aren't
malware sites I don't know most of them

385
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:38,790
MX toolbox is good what is my IP comm
and IP to location these are all sites

386
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,149
where you can go and you can paste the
header in and it will tell you

387
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:45,600
information about that header whether or
not you have to worry about how am i

388
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,899
doing on time I'm ok
all right so online header it so here's

389
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,370
G sweet so this is Google and here
Google has told me it's passed the s

390
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:59,789
it's past the dkim and it's past Demark
so what that tells me is it came from an

391
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:06,570
authorized sender the message contents
were not changed and because of that the

392
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:12,299
demarcus passed typically somebody who
is not dealt with a lot of phishing

393
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:18,629
emails it's legit alright but we're
gonna find out how it may not be legit

394
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:24,000
just like zero out of 69 on virustotal
main mean may be meaningless this is now

395
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,210
meaningless to me if however it fails
SPF and it fails DKIM and it fails the

396
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,450
mark okay
I know I have an issue so we're really

397
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:38,519
get in the habit of looking at those
things alright so here we have Verizon

398
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:44,789
Communications the email claims to come
from Verizon communication but I or

399
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:51,289
actually it claims to come from Bank of
America but it's coming from let's see

400
00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:55,980
maybe it's claiming to come from Verizon
comm but it's coming from online no it

401
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,299
must be come from Bank of America that's
right it's pretending to come from Bank

402
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:06,658
of America but it actually came from
Verizon somebody using their horizon

403
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:11,970
account to send me a fish I pretty much
know art this is a phishing email and

404
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:15,839
done with this one
from the standpoint of those of you that

405
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,040
are documenting the indicators are
compromised and the threat intelligence

406
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,199
this is more threat Intel that we want
to know about because we may be able to

407
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,399
block things based upon you know what
we're starting to see different things

408
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:34,549
coming from Verizon comm
that are faking being from our domain

409
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:41,460
okay can headers be spoofed or faked yes
but only part of them can be faked for

410
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,720
the email to be delivered some of the
information in that our header has to be

411
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:52,980
real so when you do your analysis it's
all suspect except the last hop because

412
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,599
those of you they know cali org run out
on the Internet right you can fake a

413
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,030
header for those of you that are
documenting threat intelligence when you

414
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:11,900
have when you start seeing Japan Japan
in japan japan comcast in florida right

415
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,569
you start you can start saying to the
email administrator you know what i'm

416
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:19,500
seeing all of this from japan i want to
block anything that inator has this

417
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,160
information because didn't actually come
from there it's being faked all right

418
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,160
how do i do that job because this is
cipher con

419
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,859
so here's mm keys mailer and NM keys
mailer you can click on advanced

420
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:37,770
settings and you can add a header yeah
so if I add the center I can I can send

421
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:42,299
anything I want from anywhere I want now
when I would this was a mistake I

422
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:46,980
probably should have done this when I
was learning to use this I thought well

423
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:53,309
Who am I gonna use Donald Trump at
whitehouse.gov like I'll just take that

424
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:59,369
as a head and the email never got to me
and I thought oh I'm on a list now so

425
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:02,640
when you're playing around with this
stuff and sending yourself fake headers

426
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,828
come up with something probably not that
oh look here it is it made it to me

427
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:11,910
alright so here we go Donald Trump Trump
D Trump at whitehouse.gov

428
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:17,520
I want to fake the header so I I faked
the email address you'll notice my SPF

429
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,329
and my D mark failed so I'm done right
all right I know R it's fake it's this

430
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:25,680
is no good but I'm not done as the
analyst because I'm keeping my

431
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,520
indicators of compromise and my threat
intelligence I'm gonna do a complete job

432
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,099
so I have all that data you'll notice
it's it it actually came from the last

433
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:42,530
hop was M key dots easy so this came
from the Czech Republic not from

434
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:49,980
Washington DC this was very interesting
to me right so I think what I did is I

435
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:57,420
faked a Poland header and I sent it an
IP to location told me yeah I kicked it

436
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,569
started in Poland and then I went to the
Czech Republic and then it came to me

437
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:05,279
and the reality is it never went through
Poland I faked that Poland header so it

438
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,510
actually came from the Czech Republic so
then a typical typical person is gonna

439
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:14,430
say well and Joel all I got to do is
look at the last one technically you

440
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:18,058
would be correct right look at the last
hop that's where it came from but if

441
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:21,280
you're documenting those in
caters to compromising that threat

442
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,089
intelligence you want to know every op
it made because multiple of those hops

443
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:32,410
may have been faked time can fish pass
SPF DK I'm an IP check can a fish do

444
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:38,140
that sure if a hacked email account is
used everything will pass how many of

445
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,549
you are seeing B C's business email
compromised also known as a EC account

446
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:50,859
email compromised also known as a supply
chain attacks right hey so a legitimate

447
00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:55,720
organization that deals with your
organization gets hacked probably

448
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:03,118
through outlook 365 that person's email
is now being used to send you an email

449
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:09,160
everything is going to pass now you're
getting a fish that is absolutely legit

450
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:15,250
except for the contents can they put
those contents on a legitimate domain

451
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:20,560
and then can they put a hyperlink to a
legitimate domain that zero out of sixty

452
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,980
nine a these are gonna flag we learned
that earlier

453
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,940
absolutely so now things get really
really difficult

454
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:34,180
now you have to have a user who can say
this is not normal this is going to

455
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:39,069
increase your calls to the Service Desk
this is going to increase your workload

456
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:43,830
especially if whether it's a false
positive or not you have to analyze it

457
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:49,690
but it's gonna make you more secure
industry is seeing a rise in this tactic

458
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,410
business email compromising email
compromised revisit biggest phishing

459
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:58,779
scams of 2018 since 2019 is now over a
hundred and twenty six percent increase

460
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:05,050
in email account takeover why because a
whole lot of email addresses are just

461
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:09,700
being dropped the only way the bad guy
can get into your organization is if

462
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:18,339
they go after a legitimate email address
okay inspecting attachments how are you

463
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:22,450
going to do this if you're the security
analyst you're the investigator you're

464
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:28,419
the examiner and you now have an
attachment how do you examine alright

465
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:32,150
well who who is it coming from whether
the could work to the kind of first

466
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,289
you ask is who is this pretending or who
might it be coming from

467
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:42,049
and what could the contents be I'm in
health care I have to be very careful

468
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:46,250
about any attachment that comes in
because if it's a false positive it may

469
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:51,559
contain pH I I can't upload that to
hybrid analysis or virustotal

470
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:56,059
so I have to five minutes ago I got a
move so I have to be very careful about

471
00:39:56,059 --> 00:40:00,500
how I analyze these you may be in the
same if those of you that are in the

472
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,339
banking industry those of you that are
in education right you may have

473
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:09,410
something that is protected for you and
you can't just go upload it if you look

474
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,960
at it you say there's there's not going
to be anything in this particular

475
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,130
document then you might be able to use
virustotal hybrid analysis you might

476
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:20,690
want to open it in a sandbox or a
virtual machine I highly recommend the

477
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:25,430
virtual machine is not on your
production network all right so I

478
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:29,839
segregate this stuff get this stuff
segregated if you don't have money for a

479
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,490
sandbox there's a kuku sandbox out there
and it's free where you can it'll run on

480
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:39,049
Ubuntu it will be a pain to get
installed and working but once you got

481
00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:44,000
it it's golden you're golden you have
something that you can analyze other

482
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,799
tactics that I have used to be able to
analyze something very quickly was to

483
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:54,529
open it in a non-standard way if I get a
PDF maybe I can convert it to a doc so

484
00:40:54,529 --> 00:41:00,470
if it has malware PDF malware in it and
I open it up in in WordPad or something

485
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:05,359
right now I that malware is not going to
run and I can see the contents of email

486
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,500
convert the doc to PDF
I love hex editors I open up tons of

487
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,849
things in a hex editor because now it's
just like looking at it in a binary I

488
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:17,599
can open it up in a hex editor I can
read the document that I can call the

489
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,039
user and say does any this makes sense
to you yeah that makes sense okay then

490
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:26,420
this is probably a false positive
inspecting links caution checking on

491
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,440
public websites again you don't want to
just upload to just anywhere you have to

492
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,480
know whether or not the potential of
this document containing something that

493
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,440
you can't publish is in there so be
careful of that virustotal

494
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,180
Trend Micro com bright cloud using a
sandbox now this is a really cool thing

495
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,348
that I
started doing a couple of months ago and

496
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:52,359
it's screenshot guru this one I did
inspect so the last time I looked at it

497
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:56,859
no malware here what you can do is if
somebody gets a hyperlink and you don't

498
00:41:56,859 --> 00:42:01,150
know if that's a valid hyperlink or not
you can go to screenshot dot guru

499
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:06,310
put it in there and it will show you a
JPEG of the website so if it's a fake

500
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:12,069
tech support site or malware site you'll
get a picture of them our SEM you're

501
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:15,550
secure so if you need to make if you may
need to make a determination quickly

502
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:19,359
that's one way you might be able to do
that other things that I want to know is

503
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,380
whether or not the link redirects if the
redirection is based on time or does the

504
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,700
redirection base a change based on
browser I'm seeing this a lot the bad

505
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,319
guys are looking at the browser agent
and they're saying oh it's Mozilla and

506
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,339
they redirect me to Yahoo or Gmail or
Google what's the analysts gonna say

507
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:40,359
this website's not a problem and you're
not gonna block it at your firewall and

508
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:42,940
you're not going to contact your
firewall vendor and say this needs to be

509
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:47,440
blocked but then you change it to ie
right and then Mozilla has a plug-in

510
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,880
user agent switcher so I say you know
make it say I'm in IE and all of a

511
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:57,250
sudden I'm at a fake tech support page
so no those tactics are out there know

512
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:02,380
how you can handle some of those tactics
alright Prevention's do I probably have

513
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,560
a few minutes here two minutes
prevention steps blocking the email

514
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,020
address or domain so these are the
tactics you're taking with your

515
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,960
organization I'm gonna block the email
address I'm gonna block the domain may

516
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,880
sound easy may not be possible if it was
a business email compromise and you have

517
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,380
to deal with that person try blocking
them right you may be able to block them

518
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24,520
today but you may be unblocking them
very shortly because otherwise you

519
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,530
people don't get credentialed alright
understand that those exists remove

520
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:32,500
additional emails to users right
contacting an email administrator run

521
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:36,220
through get rid of this stuff
blocking the link URL identifying users

522
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,129
who have replied clicked or open the
attachment right if you can know that

523
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:43,690
now you may have a system that's
infected you want to stop it now we want

524
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:48,640
to take these 69 day infections and
bring them down to hours not months and

525
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:53,710
days notify your anti-phishing vendor so
if you're using something to to anti

526
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:57,560
fish and something got through
want to contact them look this got

527
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:03,049
through I want you to fix this problem
notify the email domain owner so if I

528
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:07,700
get something from that that's at some
website here and there's a pro

529
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:13,279
incontinence do I want to go alert the
website and say I want you to know that

530
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:20,690
your website is currently being used
used for fake tech support or malware

531
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:27,680
there's a pro and a con to that the pro
is I protect everyone and I cost the bad

532
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,129
guy money the con to that is they're
just gonna find another one and they're

533
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:38,540
gonna publish it and that makes me
vulnerable again because I may not know

534
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:43,910
about that one so depending upon whether
you're blocking domains that are

535
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:48,770
currently set up in only 30 days old or
right all of those things that you maybe

536
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:53,780
in the firewall you have to decide on
this I'm a proponent of making things

537
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,650
more expensive that does not mean that
the organization that I work for is a

538
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:01,270
proponent of that that is the discussion
that you have to have with them
