1
00:00:00,786 --> 00:00:03,536
(uptempo music)

2
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,580
- Okay, well thank you for
coming to my keynote speech.

3
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,900
Hopefully it can be somewhat
inspiring or something.

4
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,010
Yeah, so a little history about myself.

5
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,250
I am a Midwest gaming classic alumni.

6
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,850
I've been going to that show.

7
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,430
pretty much since the beginning,
and I actually named it.

8
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,280
There was a contest many
years ago to come up

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,120
with a name for some little
quaint Wisconsin show,

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,169
and I won a free joystick.

11
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,570
And I have been coming here ever since,

12
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,090
and so what was Dan was thinking.

13
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,500
Dan Loosen, the guy who runs that show

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,770
is like hey, we're gonna have some people

15
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,540
from MGC talk at CypherCon
and maybe vice versa,

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,660
so we can merge the shows together.

17
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,119
So yeah, a little bit about me.

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,980
You probably know about me
if you're here in this room.

19
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,260
I use to be a graphic artist,

20
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,340
I wasn't really well,
I wasn't into computer.

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,030
when I was a kid as lot
of you probably were.

22
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,620
Yeah I started off as a graphic artist,

23
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,830
and I was doing my own thing.

24
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,640
But I always like
hacking when I was a kid.

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,280
Anything, I owned was torn apart.

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,480
All the radios, all the
video game consoles,

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,030
all the toys, had the erector set

28
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,690
I was into that when I was a kid,

29
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,950
but then as I was teenager,

30
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,160
I drifted away from it unfortunately.

31
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,399
If I go back now and change anything,

32
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,620
it would be to say, hey
I take my young self

33
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,360
and shake myself and
say keep at this stuff.

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,910
You'll be so much further
along on when you're an adult

35
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,470
but whatever, we all drift
from the primrose path.

36
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,380
Anyway so I was into it

37
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,886
but around 2000, I was into hacking again.

38
00:01:56,886 --> 00:01:59,000
and obviously hacking is a big thing,

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,910
so I'm a physical mechanical hacker

40
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,761
or hardware hacker, not
necessarily a software hacker.

41
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:07,670
So my big thing was video game consoles.

42
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,920
I really the old Ataris
when I was growing up

43
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,679
but I though really
cool if I can hack this

44
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,630
into something smaller and more portable.

45
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,940
And this is back before
they had color Game Boys,

46
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,280
or backlit things, before
they even had PDAs.

47
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,330
So it seem like there could be

48
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,810
a lot of cool things to do there.

49
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,780
So what I did was I did a project

50
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,840
and it put it on GeoCites I
think it was back in 2000,

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,630
and people really got a kick out of it.

52
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,690
So this is it, oh so I realized

53
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,930
I can use my Microsoft pen.

54
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,730
Look at that, right in the end zone.

55
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,650
Yeah so as I said I was a graphic artist,

56
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,600
and we also had CNC machines.

57
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,227
So I was doing a lot of,

58
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:49,550
well I would consider
quite rudimentary now

59
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,120
but I do mechanical design.

60
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,320
I design for CNC Milling and
what not, so I had those skills

61
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,380
and I was like I can hack
up something really cool.

62
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,370
So I dragged this old Atari,

63
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,570
2600 video game console out of a barn.

64
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,316
Again Midwest Gaming Classic, video games.

65
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:06,880
And I put it through the bandsaw,

66
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,420
and I hacked it up, I'm
like you don't need this,

67
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,209
you don't need, you don't need
this, you don't need this,

68
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,800
What is the minimum need to make this run?

69
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,620
And I created this really cool,

70
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,920
portable that you see on the right there.

71
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,369
And that's original that I ever made,

72
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,150
and so it was hardware hacking.

73
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,730
And obviously back in the 70s,

74
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,910
they have all sorts of
RF shielding on things.

75
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,600
Like inch thick or not inch thick.

76
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,760
Eight inch thick aluminum

77
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,970
which is still ridiculous
by today standards.

78
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,490
So I started doing that, that
was my early hacking stuff.

79
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,430
What I wanna do today is talk about

80
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,350
some of the stuff I've done
if you haven't seen it before.

81
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,640
Then talk about how I feel about hacking.

82
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,709
How I think it's important

83
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,710
and hopefully leave you with
a message of joy and hope.

84
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,250
Look at these terrible wiring jobs.

85
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,060
This is a really horrible hack.

86
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,000
I look at this now and
I am fairly embarrassed

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,080
by my soldering skills.

88
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,530
They're a little better now,
but it was really important,

89
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,190
because back then, this is around 2000.

90
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,190
There really wasn't what you have

91
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,660
"the maker movement now,"
and there wasn't much.

92
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,820
If you look on the right hand side here.

93
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,130
This is a diagram of how to get

94
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,194
composite videos from a
1970s video game console.

95
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:18,969
Back then, my terrible
drawings were the best

96
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,440
because nobody else had really done it.

97
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,210
So it is really quite a different world

98
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,659
and much like early hackers
back in the 70s and 80s

99
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,850
were trying to figure out how
the computer systems work.

100
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,410
I had to figure out how a
lot of these old videos game

101
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,520
consoles work so I can share
the information with people

102
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,010
that wanted to mod their own things.

103
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,050
Now, also if you're interested
in videos game consoles,

104
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,620
there's a bit build room
right down the hall.

105
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,040
It's a lot of people
that were on my website

106
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,510
back in the day and now they've advance

107
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,820
far beyond what I could ever do.

108
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,520
So you should check out their
work, it very impressive.

109
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,940
So that's what I start doing,

110
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,300
I created a website back in 2004.

111
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,790
I still have it BenHeck.com,
sevenletter.com for the win.

112
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,730
They're pretty cool.

113
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,430
So anyway I was this is really
cool, this is really fun

114
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,660
so I started hacking more things.

115
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,370
And luckily since I was a graphic artist,

116
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,420
I was good at drawing things

117
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,580
and also building them in the real world.

118
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,620
So my big thing back then,

119
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,690
I wasn't very good at electronics.

120
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,690
I'm still only just passible,

121
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,800
but I can make things look
good, that's what matters.

122
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,200
So yeah I made some of
these new cool ATARIs here,

123
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,460
There's a wooden one on the right.

124
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,150
This was actually like a stair step

125
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,060
at Menards or Home Depot.

126
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,940
Oh wait, you're from Wisconsin,
so I can say Menards,

127
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,390
you know what that means.

128
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,020
It was really fun and so
anyway I started branching off

129
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,030
into more computers and different things.

130
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,050
Super Nintendo was really cool.

131
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,750
I tried to make a console that
look a question mark block

132
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,190
that Mario would hit his head against.

133
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,110
And it was really fun just
capturing the aesthetic

134
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,240
of those original consoles,

135
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,890
so you felt like you were in the 80s.

136
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,840
Because so much of this is about
nostalgia and how you feel,

137
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,869
and so if you can make
someone feel like they're

138
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,870
oh that's my childhood.

139
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,380
I've relived it, that's really the key,

140
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,110
and what I started doing
around this time, around 2001.

141
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,780
I was still working full time,

142
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,739
but I started building
things on the sides,

143
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,210
and I was selling them.

144
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,659
And I was turning it
into a little business,

145
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,870
and I'll get into that a little later.

146
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,810
But I think it's just really amazing.

147
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,430
If you made something really cool,

148
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,885
people gravitate toward it.

149
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:17,570
Even here on the right
hand, this is a Apple IIGS,

150
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,430
which is my favorite
classic Apple computer.

151
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,610
The IIGS meaning graphics and sound.

152
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,740
Yes, I think they probably
have one in their the room.

153
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,220
Yeah so let me just show
you a few other things

154
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,620
that I have here that I did.

155
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,490
So I started branching
out in other things,

156
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,560
hacking more things and
Commodore is really cool.

157
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,710
I think about it, I try
not to think about things

158
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,109
that I necessarily love the most.

159
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,280
I was an Atari 800 kid,
so of course in theory,

160
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,078
I should be at war with
the Commodore people

161
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:47,560
even though the system is superior.

162
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,750
I have to admit that from
a technical stand point.

163
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,210
But I started branching
out and I'm like OK,

164
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,250
people like Commodores.

165
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,390
So again I'd be like this pic
looks like it's from the 80s.

166
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,740
The original hardware's in there,

167
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,480
it wasn't been hacked too much,

168
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,950
but it all about giving it a new look,

169
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,990
making sure the original keyboard works,

170
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,500
so it looks and feels
the same and still works.

171
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,169
Although if you look into the
front here really closely,

172
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:11,531
there is an FC card slot.

173
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,700
That's become more prevalent now

174
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,479
but in the mid 2000s,
there weren't a whole

175
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,719
lot of solutions for just drive emulation.

176
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:18,621
Now a days, they have them
you know falling off of trees.

177
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:21,885
Another thing I did
that was really popular

178
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:26,885
around 12 years ago was I started
getting into the Xbox 360.

179
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,930
For some reason, I'm like I'm
gonna make a Xbox 360 laptop.

180
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,950
I don't know why, but
my God it was popular.

181
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,240
Everyone wanted it.

182
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,860
This one actually done for
well, they're defunct now.

183
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,150
THQ but I also did a lot of
work with videos game companies

184
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,840
where I would make them promotional items

185
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,580
so that has actually work out pretty well.

186
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,919
I'll get into that a little bit more,

187
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,997
as we go through the talk.

188
00:07:47,997 --> 00:07:49,630
I want to make sure that it in 45 minutes

189
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,890
'cause I love to being punctual
or on time I should say.

190
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,340
Use all the correct bits.

191
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,679
I branched off into other things.

192
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,160
I was doing PlayStation 2 portable,

193
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,440
this one quite large again.

194
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,110
If you wanna see some great
evolution of these ideas

195
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,160
go into the bit built room.

196
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,010
They've got some amazing stuff in there

197
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,690
because as I went off and
corporate with my show,

198
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,810
they kept hacking and
they've eclipsed me by now.

199
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,780
Yeah, oh this is another fun one, NEO GEO.

200
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,909
You can take the arcade machine

201
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,890
and basically make it down into that

202
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,810
because some of you might know

203
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,610
there's not much in arcade machines.

204
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,800
Yeah, here's a few more.

205
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,500
Another version of the
Commodore, here on the right.

206
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,020
Actually make two of those
because what will happen.

207
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,729
What I use to do is I
would just build something

208
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,563
that I thought was really cool.

209
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:33,319
Like oh well, I really had the Commodore.

210
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,900
I really like the Atari.

211
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,039
I like the Apple IIGS,

212
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,750
and then I would just
randomly to build things.

213
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,429
And then I always put them online,

214
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,719
and people would always buy them,

215
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,553
which is really cool.

216
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:43,974
I've gotten away from that
because I haven't had time.

217
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:46,300
Maybe I'll get back into it in the future.

218
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,089
Oh and on the left here,
we have a PlayStation 3

219
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:53,550
that's been hacked down
into a more portable form.

220
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,160
Now I should preface this question.

221
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,819
I don't do the hacking
where you can play like ROMS

222
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,130
or hacked disks.

223
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,860
I try to stay away from
that because I'm usually

224
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,040
maybe this sacrosanct to say.

225
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,949
I'm usually pretty cozy
with video games companies

226
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,900
and developers so I want
to stay on their good side.

227
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,740
But yeah, anyway so I did
that for quite a long time,

228
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,880
and along the way, I quit my day job.

229
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,080
They say don't quit your day job

230
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,260
well I did quit my day job,

231
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,050
and I wrote a book about hacking.

232
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,359
But it worked out pretty well

233
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,350
because I was okay, some
day I could get back

234
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,183
to working for the man.

235
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:28,189
I could get back to working for the man,

236
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,100
but I never really did

237
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,290
because if you hack it, they will come.

238
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,959
All these people were continuing
to ask for new, cool things

239
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,160
and I just kept building them

240
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,069
and I didn't have time to
go back to a normal job.

241
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,390
I guess that's the dream but
it could also be the hell

242
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,780
because if you're hobby becomes your job

243
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,930
then you have to find a new hobby.

244
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,270
That's good advice for everyone.

245
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,380
So around 2010, we started
doing The Ben Heck Show.

246
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,920
And just for the record, I
didn't want it to be called

247
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,120
The Ben Heck Show because
I'm not that egotistical.

248
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,296
I'm selfish not egotistical,
completely different.

249
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:06,080
But this ad agency is like,

250
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,710
hey, we have this client Element 14,

251
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,543
which is part of Premiere Farnel Newerk,

252
00:10:08,543 --> 00:10:09,376
an electronics distributor,

253
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,000
and they wanna have an online presence

254
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,500
about electronics and hacking

255
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,790
and getting people excited
about their community.

256
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,370
Would you like to make
a web series for them?

257
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,110
And I was like, yeah
sure, that sounds cool.

258
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,740
This was around 2010,
obviously YouTube existed

259
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,690
but it wasn't really in
the form that it is today.

260
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,970
So I said yeah, I'll take a shot at it,

261
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,630
and the plan was to build cool
devices that served a purpose

262
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,260
instead of just doing things for show.

263
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,490
And Joe and I were talking
about this yesterday

264
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,811
how of course I was a MythBusters fan

265
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:42,500
but it seemed like they were usually

266
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,570
just blowing things up all the time.

267
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,740
So I wanted to make things resectability

268
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,770
or hack existing products
so they could help people

269
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,520
who might not be as abled as you or I.

270
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,060
Of course we've done a lot
of fluff along the way,

271
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,839
but that was my idea.

272
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,290
Anyway, we started in
2010 as bi-weekly episodes

273
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,880
doing it part time.

274
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,390
By 2012, we were doing it every week,

275
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,650
and working full time.

276
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,990
So a lot of people have asked me,

277
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,840
"Ben why are you leaving your show?"

278
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,340
Which is called The Ben Heck Show

279
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,930
and I tell them that I've had eight years

280
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,500
of one to two weeks deadlines

281
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,491
and it's really taking a toll
on me, and I need a break.

282
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:22,140
That's why we're quitting it,

283
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,580
although there's 350
episodes by time we're done,

284
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,880
so you can watch it for eternity.

285
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,990
It's like the Simpsons, never ending.

286
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,490
So anyway, so this is
what we did in the show.

287
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,230
So the show, we branched
out from just video games.

288
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,390
Until this time, I was
all about video games

289
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,077
but we try to do some more things.

290
00:11:40,077 --> 00:11:44,940
Although here on the left is
viola, a video game system.

291
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,140
That one was something we hacked up for

292
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,270
I think it was a
contractor, Overnight Rack.

293
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,310
They kept getting sand to clog
in the video game console.

294
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,560
I don't know if you've met anyone

295
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,670
who was in the second Iraqi war

296
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,400
but there is a lot of Xbox
playing going on apparently.

297
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,810
And sand clogging of the
fans was a big issue,

298
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,239
so if you can see right here.

299
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,570
There's actually a filter
system, on the fan.

300
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,160
So that's something you
might not think about

301
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,850
like you see with pet hair too.

302
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,860
I'm sure that's not a probably

303
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,113
a better use domestically.

304
00:12:16,113 --> 00:12:17,940
Yeah, so when we start doing the show,

305
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,140
I just wanted to do kind
of random, cool hacks

306
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,330
and the big thing for me as I mentioned

307
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,040
I was building things for
people on demand, client work.

308
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,510
But with the show, since we had a budget.

309
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,802
I was able to justify things
that might not necessarily

310
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:34,530
make sense so I did some cool things.

311
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,620
I tried to make a domestic,
electronic can crusher,

312
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,690
which I still haven't really nailed

313
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,280
or this which is a computer heat sink

314
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,110
LTR aluminum can cooler.

315
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,650
I don't know if you're familiar with LTRs

316
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,390
but it's a device that
can basically transfer

317
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,689
heat through electricity.

318
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,470
I'm sorry the electricity
doesn't make the heat transfer.

319
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,040
It can basically pulls all
the heat away from the can,

320
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,719
dumps it into the heat sink,
and then blows it away.

321
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,250
We started doing cool things like that.

322
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,190
Around this time, I know this maybe this

323
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,850
isn't really the fort
of the hacking scene,

324
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,040
but I really got into 3D printers.

325
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,770
And 3D printers started
out, when I first saw them

326
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,780
I'm like well that's a great gimmick.

327
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,069
You can make a bottle opener
with a penny, who cares?

328
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:21,880
But then I started getting into them

329
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,939
and I was like, my God, I was so wrong.

330
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,350
I love 3D printers.

331
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,100
I don't think it's one of those
are things where every home

332
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,610
is gonna have one maybe a hundred years

333
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,060
when we have replicators like Star Trek.

334
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,670
But I really got into it,

335
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,729
and for some reason I thought I could.

336
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,900
I started making my own.

337
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,140
Both of these here I design myself.

338
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,780
It has all of your lovely wood

339
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,449
and laser slot construction there.

340
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,870
But the thing that I found
interesting about 3D printers

341
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:50,870
as far as hackers go is that
they've existed for decades.

342
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,621
But what happened was entrepreneurs,

343
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:56,000
yes including people like maker Bobbitt,

344
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,460
also Josef Prusa figured
out a way to hack it down

345
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,940
and make it available for the masses.

346
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,360
And I think that's what's really important

347
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,360
about any sort of movement
or alternative manufacturing

348
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,410
is figuring out ways to make
things work for everyone.

349
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,160
I think that was really what
made 3D printers explode

350
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,260
instead of having a $30,000 strati-is,

351
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,960
you could have a $1000
maker bot or a $1200 Prusa.

352
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,140
And I really got into it,
and I really enjoyed it

353
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,360
working with it over the years.

354
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,080
And so speaking of hacking,
this summit I thought.

355
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,310
No solution is two silly,

356
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,390
which is a point I'll
probably gonna harp on

357
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,590
quite a bit during my talk.

358
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,950
The very first thing I printed

359
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,030
with my first off the shelf 3D printer

360
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:45,020
was a lid for my SPAM because
if you eat the whole thing

361
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,871
of SPAM, you'll probably die from sodium.

362
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:50,060
(audience laughing)

363
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,530
So I was like, okay, and I don't know.

364
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,660
I think it was just fun for me.

365
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,510
I wanted to, you can't buy SPAM lid

366
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,520
but you can hack a SPAM lid.

367
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,050
You really should put
Saran wrap on it though

368
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,709
because it's not a perfect seal.

369
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,980
And you can't really see it here.

370
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,920
I tried to adust the gain
'cause I printed it black

371
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,729
but there's a little edge to it.

372
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,263
So you can also use it to slice your SPAM.

373
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:12,096
(audience laughing)

374
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:15,040
'Cause SPAM has a consistency
of butter as you may know.

375
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,199
There's actually more flavors
of SPAM than you might think.

376
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,140
They have specific flavors
for different countries even.

377
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,560
Anyway that was something
but here's the thing.

378
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,080
No solution is too silly,

379
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:27,071
you might make something that might.

380
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:28,630
Who would need this?

381
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,730
Who would want this?

382
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,820
And the thing that's
great about the internet

383
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,480
verse a hundred years ago
when you could only sell

384
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,560
things to people that live
in your own small town.

385
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,790
Someone out there will need it.

386
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,233
And hopefully a lot of someones

387
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:40,220
and then you can even
make a career out of it

388
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,519
which I'll get to in a little bit.

389
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,910
So here's something kinda' crazy.

390
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,560
This is another thing that I
probably wouldn't have built

391
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,113
unless we had the show.

392
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,950
But there's this guy, and he's like,

393
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,420
"Hey, I like to play pinball,"
as a lot of you might know.

394
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,479
I'm into pinball.

395
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,030
This guy is like, "I like to play pinball

396
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,600
"but I only have my right arm."

397
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,750
And of course the pinball machine,

398
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,730
you have to do this.

399
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,080
You have to straddle it with your arms.

400
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,360
Now, the first things someone might think

401
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,180
is okay, it's just a button.

402
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,859
Drill a hole the side of your game,

403
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,600
then stick a second button in there

404
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,880
by your right hand like this.

405
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,580
But here's the thing pinball machines

406
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,830
are really, really, really expensive.

407
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,960
And some of them are very desirable

408
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,840
and rare and whatnot.

409
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,440
So what if you go over
to your buddy's house?

410
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,990
And your buddy is gonna be like

411
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,770
"Yeah, don't drill holes in my machines."

412
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,390
So we came up with for this guy,

413
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,330
and this is what I really
feel passionate about

414
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:38,250
is accessibility and whatnot
is they have suction cups.

415
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,910
So you can slap this
onto any game you want

416
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,910
and it's adjustable.

417
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,440
There's little thumb screws
here for the distance.

418
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,040
And you put this on one
side and it has two buttons

419
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,339
on the upper one by this finger.

420
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,320
That just presses the
button that's underneath it,

421
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,740
the existing one, but
the second one activates

422
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,740
a servo over here that actually pushes

423
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,160
the other side button for you.

424
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,860
So you can push both buttons with one hand

425
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,460
on one side of the unit.

426
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,404
And what I did was I measured,

427
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:06,960
I think I had five different manufacturers

428
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,819
of pinball machines and I
created an average target

429
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,290
of where the button is in
comparison to the glass angle

430
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,530
at the front of the unit.

431
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,740
And then I average that out,
use it to create my design.

432
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,953
So yeah, things like that.

433
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:21,410
I don't think I would
have bothered doing that,

434
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,020
just on my own, but with the show,

435
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,760
it give us a lot of
flexibility to do some things

436
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,220
that might be a little more time consuming

437
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,820
than we otherwise have time for.

438
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,067
Well speaking of that, some
of the stuff we've hacked.

439
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:35,250
So this guitar here on the left.

440
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,090
I wish I had a bigger
screen here, I'm sorry.

441
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,070
I guess it not my fault

442
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,139
but I guess you can see it okay.

443
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,987
So there's this guy and I
think he's from South America.

444
00:17:45,987 --> 00:17:49,110
And he's like I can't really do his accent

445
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,949
but he's like, "I use
to play guitar mates.

446
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,585
Oh I no, that's Australia.

447
00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:54,418
(audience laughing)

448
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:56,500
I use to play guitar but
then I had to get a job

449
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,428
at the railroad.

450
00:17:57,428 --> 00:18:00,690
It's amazing the stories you
hear once people find out

451
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,680
you do accessibility, oh my
God, you hear so many stories.

452
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,250
Most of them involving motorcycles.

453
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,810
Oh I shouldn't say that
'cause I'm in Milwaukee

454
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,669
but (laughing) anyways.

455
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,050
So this guy is like, those
things were locks together

456
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,919
to lock the trains.

457
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,600
His arm got stuck in that and he's like,

458
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,639
"Now I can't play guitar anymore."

459
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,110
This is a big thing.

460
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,943
We learned this when we

461
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:24,360
went to Walter Reed, the
medical hospital too.

462
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,429
Is that when someone
is in a horrible injury

463
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,480
or they're incapacitated in some way.

464
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,990
The most important thing
is for them to get back

465
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,190
to something in their old
life so they can reclaim that.

466
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,150
And if you're an able bodied
person as most of us are.

467
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,880
We take it for granted all sorts of things

468
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,640
even like tying our shoes.

469
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,100
But once something happens,
it's completely different.

470
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,949
So this guy could no longer play guitar

471
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,510
because you have to strum and
then you have to hold the keys

472
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,300
or the strings to create the keys.

473
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,570
So he was like, "Can you help?"

474
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,230
And again, it's one of those things

475
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,820
where if I had to bill
him hourly to do it,

476
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,990
it probably wouldn't have been affordable.

477
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,700
But as a show project, we could justify it

478
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,550
because on the show we're sponsored

479
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,230
so we're all salaried.

480
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,390
You probably have the same
thing here with your show.

481
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,010
So we came up with this whole
thing where there was a,

482
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,268
it's not on camera here
but there's a foot pedal.

483
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:16,580
And so he taps his foot
to do the strumming.

484
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,000
And then we have all these controls,

485
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,310
so basically you can strum
down, you can strum up,

486
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,200
you can strum up and
down because right here.

487
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,370
Well we have a servo here

488
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,590
which does left to right of the strum.

489
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,740
And you also have a lift lever here,

490
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,700
so it will actually strum, lift it up,

491
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,640
bring it back over, bring it
back down and strum again.

492
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,020
And it actually worked out pretty well.

493
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,950
I had all the controls built into.

494
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,050
It's also really expensive to
ship things to South America

495
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,580
it turns out but I'm sorry South Africa.

496
00:19:45,257 --> 00:19:46,970
South America probably
also be really expensive

497
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,790
especially when it's Brazil.

498
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,720
Yeah, but that's why I really
enjoy doing things like that.

499
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,817
So again as far as hacking goes,

500
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:57,280
most people wouldn't think to do that,

501
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,350
but this are the kind of
things we've been lucky enough

502
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,350
to do with the show.

503
00:20:01,278 --> 00:20:02,919
We can do really
complicated builds like that

504
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:04,070
and then help people.

505
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,939
And so in the right hand photo,

506
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,320
this dorky looking photo of me

507
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,800
which is impossible not to
take 'cause I'm dorky looking.

508
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,520
So this is a seeing eye hat.

509
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,440
Actually I was in New
York this last weekend

510
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,970
and a saw a person who I
don't think was sighted

511
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,570
and I'm how would you deal with this.

512
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,689
This is insane, it's hard
enough if you have eyeballs.

513
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,690
This is just four ultrasonic
sensors with cell phone motors

514
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,020
and it tells you where you are.

515
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,670
So as you walk around, it's like.

516
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,840
It's all analog, so the
closer you are to things,

517
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,800
the more it rumbles, so
you can get a spatial.

518
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,120
I don't wanna say image but
spatial idea of where you are,

519
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,810
so that was a pretty simple build.

520
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,100
It's just a micro controller
and a bunch of sensors

521
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,750
but stuff like that's been fun.

522
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,571
So I've really enjoyed
doing things like that.

523
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:55,620
We've also done a few other
non-accessibility things,

524
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,719
well most of them are.

525
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,210
But again like hacking.

526
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:04,000
Like the one on the left here,
it's clearly a video camera

527
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,700
with an image tracker on it as well.

528
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,230
On a linear slide system.

529
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,899
So I was like hey, what
if you're making a video,

530
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,290
and you don't have a videographer.

531
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,670
What if you're not as fortunate
as I am and have a sponsor

532
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,639
and you had to do it yourself?

533
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,810
So this one would do is I
think it would track a ball.

534
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,020
So you have something,
you say okay, go here.

535
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,430
And they'll like do the X,Y.

536
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,960
I think it was pixie
which is from Kickstarter.

537
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,550
So that kinda stuff is
fun, and then we have

538
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,510
the matching 3D print to the
background there, that's great.

539
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,343
Here's another hack.

540
00:21:38,343 --> 00:21:39,280
Not a lot of people do this.

541
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,450
You can take a toaster oven
and turn it into a reflow oven.

542
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,829
That's actually pretty
straightforward to do.

543
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:51,829
But here, where we are
in America and stuff.

544
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:56,770
We have a lot of things are
already available to us.

545
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,710
We don't actually have
to hack a whole lot,

546
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,710
which is cool but I think it's important.

547
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,800
We shouldn't lose sight of the fact

548
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,520
that we still need to be innovating.

549
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,000
You know we can't just say,
oh we've got everything.

550
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,950
No, our cellphone now takes
the place of 10 devices,

551
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,520
so let's give up.

552
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,790
And I worry about that a little
bit when I see these kids

553
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,540
and they're like, their whole life,

554
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,350
and we still need to keep going.

555
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,860
Okay, I'm doing great on time.

556
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,110
So yeah, just a few
things that I've learned.

557
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,740
Just my hacking past is, if
you hack it, they will come.

558
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,190
If you make something cool,

559
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,530
somebody out there will want it.

560
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:35,129
And there is a phrase,
yeah I'm sorry, bad back.

561
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,470
What is it, if you do something
people need once a year,

562
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,370
you can make a living.

563
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,959
And if you do something
they need everyday,

564
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,720
you'll be a zillionaire.

565
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,360
And that's true, and if you
think about the old days,

566
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,399
you're like, oh, I'm in my little village,

567
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,110
and I've never gone a hundred
yards past my village.

568
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,330
I guess it's like being the hobbit.

569
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,510
But you're limited to
the people around you

570
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,490
but now you have the whole world.

571
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,960
So even if you have something
that's strange a niche

572
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,820
as accessibility beauty game controller.

573
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,820
It doesn't matter because
the internet can aggregate

574
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,530
that across so many people.

575
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,370
You can find enough
people to keep you going

576
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,449
like I don't know how
familiar you are with my show.

577
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,760
But my assistant on the show, Felix.

578
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,450
He does all of the accessibility
controller stuff now,

579
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,180
and he can't even keep up with that.

580
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,340
He does it as a side job.

581
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,510
It's pretty insane like
the number of people

582
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,900
that actually need something like that.

583
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,460
Speaking of which, no hack is too stupid.

584
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,680
Okay so this mess that
you see on the screen.

585
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,080
This was the original prototype

586
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,270
that we made for
accessibility controllers.

587
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:38,629
This is back in 2006, this guy emailed me,

588
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,500
and he's like, "Hey, I was in Iraq,

589
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,750
"and my arm got blown off by
one of those bomb things."

590
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,160
And he comes back home and
what does he want to do.

591
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,830
He wants to play video games.

592
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,639
There's so many, like with that war.

593
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,150
There's a lot of young people.

594
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,750
Really the first war of
the video game generation,

595
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,126
which is strange to say.

596
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:57,970
And if someone is injured,

597
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,810
they wanna get back to
their existing life.

598
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,169
So he's like, "Can you help me?"

599
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,570
And I'm like, this is really interesting.

600
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,610
I hadn't even thought about because again

601
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,443
I don't think about this.

602
00:24:06,443 --> 00:24:07,540
I have two hands.

603
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,670
I don't think about how
hard it might be to do.

604
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,160
So I'm like I'll totally do this for you.

605
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,000
And so I started gluing things together

606
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,540
and putting pieces of wood on it,

607
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,510
and PCBs from Radio Shack RIP, hot glue,

608
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,960
rumble motors all this.

609
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,810
This one was a mess.

610
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,750
We've refined it a lot since then

611
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:30,080
but it looks dumb and it seems silly.

612
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,730
But then we did that and
I guess this would be

613
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,120
my message for anyone.

614
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,560
You guys are probably all
pretty much super hackers

615
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,780
but even if something seems really stupid,

616
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,820
you should still go for it

617
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,760
because in the case of this.

618
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,060
This led to me doing a retail product.

619
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:49,060
It led to me doing latency
testing for video games studios.

620
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,220
We've built God knows hundreds
upon probably at least 500

621
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,910
of these things on our own.

622
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,270
Felix used it as a side form of income.

623
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,960
It's insane how much came
from that just one idea.

624
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,550
And I didn't have to think of it.

625
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,500
Someone brought it to me.

626
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,530
I just had to execute it.

627
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,310
So yeah, I guess that would
be my advice is just to.

628
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,840
It's never, it doesn't matter what it is.

629
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,780
You should always give it a shot,

630
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,430
and this is what I've tried to do.

631
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,020
Never stop hacking.

632
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,820
I have this old carpenter dude here.

633
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,870
I probably won't live that long

634
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:21,899
but yeah, I try to do that myself.

635
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,080
I try not to become
complacent with my show.

636
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,310
I wanna keep hacking so
when I'm done with the show,

637
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,210
I can still continue to hack
and keep myself out there,

638
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,096
but I don't know.

639
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,660
Old people can hack stuff too.

640
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,350
It doesn't always have to be like these

641
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,820
20 year old wonder kids.

642
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,716
So I guess another thing
I wanna talk about is

643
00:25:40,716 --> 00:25:43,070
why we still need hackers

644
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,659
when there is so much cool stuff already.

645
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,710
And I just grab this picture of one

646
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,520
of those Boston Dynamics super robots.

647
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,980
I like the one that looks
like a mule, dog thing.

648
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,780
Well it's scary almost
'cause it's in uncanny valley

649
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,710
'cause it looks like it's nature.

650
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,210
Well this is probably
preaching to the choir

651
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,510
with this stuff but I
guess I'm talking about it

652
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,201
like a retail perspective.

653
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:08,360
So I don't know, consumers of the products

654
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,750
are still mostly driven
by large companies,

655
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,350
and I don't have anything
against large companies.

656
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:17,717
But large companies always
focus on the larger market,

657
00:26:17,718 --> 00:26:20,010
and not the niche use cases.

658
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,790
So I've said for myself.

659
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,430
There's always a need for small things

660
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,194
and you might not
necessarily think about it.

661
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:29,010
I've talked to people from Microsoft

662
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,550
about the accessibility
controllers that we make.

663
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,210
And one of the responses I get is,

664
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,580
yeah we understand it's a problem

665
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,620
but there aren't enough
people that need it

666
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,949
to justify manufacture of it.

667
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,801
But then the flip side of that is Felix

668
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,957
can't build enough of
them in his spare time.

669
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:48,040
And that really puts us at a cross roads,

670
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,840
actually 3D printing has
helped a lot with that.

671
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,980
So that's definitely
something that I appreciate.

672
00:26:55,377 --> 00:26:56,976
To think about it, back in the 70s.

673
00:26:57,953 --> 00:27:02,700
HP or Honeywell or IBM,
they'd be like we don't care

674
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,380
about a person using a
computer in their home.

675
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,140
Nobody wants that, nobody needs that.

676
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,690
But they had all those garage
engineers like Steve Jobs,

677
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:15,790
I should say Steve Wozniak
first then Steve Jobs.

678
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,090
They were building all that
stuff and they're like,

679
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,889
"Hey, it turns out people do want this."

680
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,460
So granted I think we might think

681
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,780
that we have every
innovation under the sun now.

682
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,110
But they probably thought
that back in the 70s as well.

683
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,179
Oh my God, we got touch
tone phones, we're done.

684
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,000
So I think again, never stop hacking.

685
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,250
And another thing hackers take a risk

686
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,050
that large companies
won't as I talked about.

687
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,320
Oh, we can't afford to
do an injection mold,

688
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,261
we'll only sell 20,000 of.

689
00:27:41,261 --> 00:27:45,139
Yeah, a lot companies make all
sorts of other stupid crap.

690
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,940
They don't care then.

691
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,170
So yeah, I think that's a good
thing that hackers can do.

692
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,560
Hacking shouldn't just be about risks

693
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,590
but doing the cool things.

694
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,080
That's what I try to do, the cool things

695
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,710
other people might not think about.

696
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,640
Because a lot of times, hackers,

697
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,180
us, we live in the real world

698
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,050
not the focus group marketing bubble.

699
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,110
We see things, we're like
okay, that's something

700
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,179
I wish we could do.

701
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,800
One thing I did for the show.

702
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,940
I should have made a slide
for it, but one thing we did

703
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,140
which was really cool,
we had robot luggage.

704
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,800
'Cause I'd always be going
around the airport and hunched

705
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,240
over and I'm like, why
can't my luggage follow me?

706
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,920
And that was one really
cool project we did.

707
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,950
It was pretty rudimentary,
just use ultra sonics

708
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,920
but yeah, although I think
companies are doing that now.

709
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,180
So that's what I try to do.

710
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,610
I just wanna have really cool projects

711
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,429
that help people and stuff.

712
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,220
So yeah, let me just get though this here

713
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,690
so I don't go over time.

714
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,680
So here's my inspirational message.

715
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,412
Hacking is life, hacking is
the root of all progress.

716
00:28:46,412 --> 00:28:48,570
We'd be in caves if we didn't
hacked sticks into weapons.

717
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:53,070
Let me think, I know is stupid
but hey, fire was a hack.

718
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,590
Weapons were a hack.

719
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:57,870
It's just all connected.

720
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,189
And even with our advanced inventions now.

721
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,540
Hacking which takes
concepts to the next level.

722
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,540
Okay, this is where it's a
little bit more altruistic

723
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,610
and stuff but we're all in this together

724
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,179
and this is all we have to work with.

725
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,990
Again, I think about so many
people are just obsessed

726
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:13,823
with the cell phones now.

727
00:29:13,823 --> 00:29:16,661
The kids, I hope we have
the future generations

728
00:29:16,661 --> 00:29:19,510
can think outside this box a little bit.

729
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,090
Because this is what we have to work with.

730
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,420
And yeah, but I think we
could still make it better

731
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,450
and so I guess my final example here.

732
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,860
It might seem a little weird
but a really good example

733
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,260
of hacking is Cuba.

734
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,070
There's some insane stuff down there,

735
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,300
but I think it should be inspirational

736
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,800
because obviously we don't
have the challenges they do,

737
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,399
but it's still about what
do you have to work with

738
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,440
and how can you make it better.

739
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,170
They have insane stuff where

740
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,920
oh, can't charge your
hearing aid batteries

741
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,880
and they figured this out

742
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,900
or literal TV dinner where they turn

743
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,960
their TV trays into antenna.

744
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,380
That's pretty insane.

745
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,610
But that's not so much
different than what we do here.

746
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,919
We just don't have to do that,

747
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,560
but we choose to do it.

748
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,679
But heck I mean if I could.

749
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,040
If I had a company, I'd
bring up all these people

750
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,830
from Cuba to be engineers.

751
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,889
Look how good they are.

752
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,450
They're making bikes out of stuff

753
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,570
and well this isn't much of a hack.

754
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,360
It's pretty insane, but the
reason I'm bringing it up

755
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,770
is because yeah, that shows how hackers

756
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,550
can actually help the country survive

757
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,639
or help the people survive.

758
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,720
And we shouldn't lose sight of that

759
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,980
just because we have
everything pretty much here.

760
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,590
We still should be thinking about hacking

761
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,139
and how we can change things.

762
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,510
And it might be something that's trivial

763
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,080
as a video game console or
maybe somewhat more altruistic

764
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,199
as making accessibility console.

765
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,140
Don't take your hard work for face value.

766
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,113
See what you can do with it, hack it.

767
00:30:44,113 --> 00:30:46,290
Whatever corporation made it originally,

768
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,159
they did it to a budget.

769
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,240
They did it to a schedule.

770
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,590
It's not because they
didn't wanna make it better.

771
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,179
They just ran out of time.

772
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,510
And as hackers or home
brewers, we have the luxury

773
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,750
of taking more time to do things

774
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,500
and squeezing everything out of it.

775
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,300
And one more slide about Cuba.

776
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,020
Even if you don't wanna stay in Cuba,

777
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,810
you still have to hack your escape

778
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:07,460
so very, very hacky worthy down there.

779
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,330
So yes, excuse me.

780
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:12,580
Just a few more notes here.

781
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,199
So for myself personal or future projects.

782
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,020
I wanna get more into accessibility.

783
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,000
I really think that's cool

784
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,500
where they have the 3D
printed prosthetics.

785
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,200
Because prosthetics
are stupidly expensive,

786
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,033
I don't know why.

787
00:31:23,033 --> 00:31:25,310
I think it really cool if
you could design it backwards

788
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,690
from the hands, you make a modular.

789
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,523
Do you need this?

790
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:29,745
Do you need this?

791
00:31:29,745 --> 00:31:30,578
Do you need this?

792
00:31:30,578 --> 00:31:31,411
Do you need this?

793
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:32,244
And then just create what you need.

794
00:31:32,244 --> 00:31:33,480
I'd love to get into that stuff.

795
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,210
I'd love to have a wall of 3D printers.

796
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,260
That's my goal.

797
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,090
Nine of them, perfectly in a row.

798
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,300
They could just spool them all day long.

799
00:31:42,936 --> 00:31:43,899
What I would like to see from hacking?

800
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,310
I guess, as I mentioned a couple times.

801
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,210
The hacker movement or the maker movement

802
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,030
as well is really incredible.

803
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,740
I just hope that our kids
don't get too wrapped up

804
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,432
in cellphones and they still
say hey, we can get out there,

805
00:31:58,432 --> 00:31:59,690
and build some stuff.

806
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,020
Although, if you think about it.

807
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,670
If I go back to the 80s, my
parents were probably like,

808
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,770
"Oh Ben, he's too wrapped
up in his video games.

809
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,470
"He's not going to do
anything besides video games."

810
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,251
But then video games can act
as a gateway drug so to speak.

811
00:32:10,251 --> 00:32:12,370
It gets you excited in other things.

812
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:17,860
So hopefully there's
some cool stuff there.

813
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:22,310
I think what's really cool
was the Nintendo switch label

814
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,750
or whatever that cardboard thing was.

815
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,930
Have you seen that?

816
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:25,900
That's really cool.

817
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,510
Okay, here's your electronics.

818
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,550
Here's how we get that into the real world

819
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,399
so hopefully we can see
more stuff like that.

820
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,850
What hacking could do better?

821
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,110
Well I mean it's a lot
different than the 80s where

822
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,459
there's a stigma about hackers.

823
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,810
Everyone was trying to
launch nukes or whatever.

824
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,610
Obviously that's not what it's about.

825
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:43,620
Hopefully that's what it's not about

826
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:47,770
but yeah, maybe get more
people excited about it.

827
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:50,540
Have people not be complacent
with their electronics

828
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,730
like oh my gosh, my selfie
camera doesn't work.

829
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,590
Okay figure something out.

830
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,520
Or make it better yourself,

831
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,510
don't rely on the super
corporations to do it for you

832
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,016
because they're thinking about
what a billion people want,

833
00:33:02,016 --> 00:33:03,710
not what one person wants.

834
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,970
But again, a billion
people didn't want a car

835
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,300
until someone is like,
"Hey, your horse sucks."

836
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,960
So you just never know until you do it.

837
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,450
Yes, so I guess where do we go from here.

838
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,140
I would say yeah, just
hope more people can hack,

839
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,520
hope more people think about that stuff

840
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,560
that was the whole reason I did the show

841
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,240
was I wanted to inspire people to think

842
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,630
about things differently.

843
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,560
It's pretty insane now looking at it

844
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,770
'cause I'll have someone come up and say,

845
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,379
"Hey, I started watching your
show then I went to college.

846
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,730
"I got a degree and now I'm an engineer."

847
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,721
And I'm like, oh God, it
show had been on that long.

848
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,861
It's insane to think about.

849
00:33:34,861 --> 00:33:38,720
So yeah, that's pretty much it for slides

850
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,610
and all of my random stuff
about welding in Cuba.

851
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,459
I wonder where they even get welding rods?

852
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,740
I just find it fascinating all right

853
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,740
'cause it's like you're on,

854
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,420
it's always like a deserted island.

855
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,450
Danger Will Robinson.

856
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,850
Like where do you get stuff?

857
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,220
Yeah, so I guess maybe like 10 minutes

858
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,870
of questions and answers
and that will wrap it up.

859
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,746
But thanks for coming.

860
00:33:58,746 --> 00:34:01,913
(audience applauding)

861
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,440
Joe.

862
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,630
- [Joe] What are some
of your preferred tools

863
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:17,630
for your modeling and mechanical
3D printing side of things?

864
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:21,030
- Well, Element 14 distributes Autodesk,

865
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:24,360
so we've been using
Autodesk's Fusion 360 a lot.

866
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,590
There are some limitations with it,

867
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,560
but I've been more or less happy with it.

868
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,929
I use to do everything in two dimensions

869
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:31,009
but obviously three is better.

870
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,240
Although I still lay out
things in two dimensions

871
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,639
'cause sometimes that's all you need

872
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,569
especially when your
machines are two dimensional.

873
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,070
Especially like laser cutters.

874
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,910
- [Man] Do you (indistinct talking).

875
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,250
You said you were (indistinct talking)?

876
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,100
- There's other solutions.

877
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,139
A lot of people use Blender.

878
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:48,020
You can use Tinkercad, OpenSCAD.

879
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,730
There's a lot of ways to do it.

880
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,929
There are a lot of free solutions

881
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:52,790
because I think again, what
a lot of companies are doing.

882
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,210
They're trying to get the maker movement

883
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,380
into their products.

884
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,270
Think about Ardweno was
a great Trojan horse

885
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:01,170
for at-mail or whatever
companies owns it now.

886
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,489
Yes, sir.

887
00:35:05,489 --> 00:35:08,180
- [Man] Everything is
becoming more and more defined

888
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,149
to be (mumbles).

889
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,461
- Yeah.

890
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:11,294
- [Man] Do you think that helps

891
00:35:11,294 --> 00:35:14,060
makes the (mumbles)?

892
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,610
- Well I would say it hurts it.

893
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,190
I was trying to fix my
phone a couple weeks ago,

894
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:21,360
and it's embarrassing I couldn't do it.

895
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,910
I would think I would be able to do it.

896
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,339
Maybe I'm just out of touch or something.

897
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:30,260
They do it for a reason
because they make it look sexy,

898
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,840
screws aren't sexy.

899
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,910
You get through it, it's all screws.

900
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:36,100
But yeah, you shouldn't
have to break your phone

901
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,779
to get into it, but that's a problem.

902
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,830
That's what's happening right now

903
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,671
with video game consoles and televisions.

904
00:35:41,671 --> 00:35:44,279
These stupid cell phones
have basically taken over

905
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,070
'cause it's like we can sell someone

906
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,910
a $600 piece of
electronics every two years

907
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,930
verses a $600 television every 10 years.

908
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,589
And these things basically making

909
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,700
these things fragile pieces of crap

910
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,129
have basically addicted the manufacturers

911
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,990
into basically having some
that can't be repaired.

912
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:04,020
But it really bugs me

913
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,020
because what happens to all this stuff.

914
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,410
Let me talk about AOL
disk for crying out loud.

915
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:12,080
We're gonna be able to make a
moon out of these eventually.

916
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,420
I always think someday
I bet we're gonna have

917
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,900
to mine our own garbage.

918
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,750
Yeah, that would be a
good futuristic movie.

919
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,260
So I find it discouraging especially

920
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,860
because this is like the
primo de facto technology

921
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,790
that everyone has now.

922
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,630
It's not even like a
laptop you can take apart,

923
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,480
but it's too bad.

924
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,100
And certainly you can't hand solder.

925
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,049
It's not like 40 years ago, I
could make an expansion card

926
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,880
from an Apple II, you
can't do that by hand here.

927
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,110
Anyone else?

928
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,800
Yeah, a few minutes, yes.

929
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,480
- [Man] So when you do those
one hand game controllers.

930
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,826
- Yep.

931
00:36:45,826 --> 00:36:47,495
- [Man] How do you test them
and are they ambidextrous?

932
00:36:47,495 --> 00:36:50,190
- So what we do is we have a
left and right handed model

933
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,450
version of it so it's not ambidextrous.

934
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,640
As far as testing goes,

935
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,609
I usually just plug it
into a Windows computer

936
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,220
and go into the menu.

937
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,060
I use to test it on Xbox hardware

938
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,100
but I'm always worried that
I'm gonna accidentally rent

939
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,450
an Adam Sandler movie by
pushing buttons randomly.

940
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,529
- [Man] You test them yourself?

941
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,290
- Yes, I test them myself
and I'm actually designing

942
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:11,590
a new version now that's
for the PlayStation 4,

943
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,810
which is something I've
always wanted to do

944
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,160
but hopefully when I'm done with the show,

945
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,890
I'll actually have some time to do it.

946
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,950
And in that case I'm actually modeling it

947
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,100
as a right handed unit
because I'm right handed.

948
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,509
It's easier for me to test,

949
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,790
and then once I have it all designed.

950
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,009
I'll just mirror it in Fusion or whatever

951
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,810
and then boom have both versions.

952
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,490
And then it will just
be a case of which one

953
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,660
I tell the printer to print.

954
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,930
But that is a problem
as product because yes,

955
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,100
not only do you have a niche product,

956
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,750
but you have two versions of it.

957
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,070
And then even worse, well
actually no it's true

958
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:42,368
because if you think about people

959
00:37:42,368 --> 00:37:43,440
who are left handed verses right handed.

960
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,090
There is way more righties than lefties,

961
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,880
so companies they do discriminate

962
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,170
against left handed people.

963
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,720
But then when you get into an injury,

964
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,049
it is often, they usually
lose their left hand

965
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:56,850
because most people are right
handed, they protect this one.

966
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,880
So I have seen statistically
that you usually end up with

967
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,220
more right handed controllers
because the less dominant hand

968
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,209
basically gets ruined more often.

969
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,340
Anyone else?

970
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,895
Yes, sir.

971
00:38:10,895 --> 00:38:12,159
- [Man] What's your favorite failure?

972
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,217
- My favorite failure?

973
00:38:13,217 --> 00:38:14,050
- [Man] Yes.

974
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:17,030
- I would say probably, I
made a Commodore 64 laptop

975
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,103
around 10 years ago, not
the one that was pictured,

976
00:38:19,103 --> 00:38:20,280
which is important.

977
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,400
Some guy commissioned it.

978
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,470
He's like, "I want a Commodore 64 laptop."

979
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,859
And I was working on it forever,

980
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,472
and I was having so much trouble with it.

981
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,200
I was probably about 31 at the time,

982
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,140
and I was thinking, oh
this sucks, this sucks

983
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,890
and I kept trying to make it work.

984
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:37,520
And eventually I'm like, this sucks.

985
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,770
And so I took all the designs
and I just threw them out.

986
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,650
I took the case, I think I gave
it away at a show like this

987
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,520
and I just started over.

988
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,400
And then when I started it
over, I came up with that

989
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,980
which I think worked out really well.

990
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,490
And it was a good lesson for me

991
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:54,240
'cause well I'm also in film production.

992
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,700
I know it's completely off topic,

993
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,710
but sometimes if an idea sucks.

994
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,980
Instead of trying to make it work,

995
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,490
you just need to cut
it off and start over.

996
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,700
So that's why I felt
the Commodore 64 failure

997
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,359
was good because it
taught me to start over.

998
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,780
I've had some other projects
that I would consider failures

999
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,790
that I didn't learn from
or I just didn't care for,

1000
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,160
so I wouldn't list those as well.

1001
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,850
But the Commodore was a good failure.

1002
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,040
Yes sir, behind him.

1003
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,687
- [Man] What is the most
costly project that you in your

1004
00:39:21,687 --> 00:39:23,509
(indistinct talking)?

1005
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:26,427
Either by time or money or
goal that didn't go anywhere?

1006
00:39:26,427 --> 00:39:29,227
Should that deter me, is that
just because I'm a student

1007
00:39:30,929 --> 00:39:32,348
and I don't have it as a full time job?

1008
00:39:32,348 --> 00:39:35,098
Is that something, where I
am, I've done some projects.

1009
00:39:36,224 --> 00:39:38,020
I don't know I guess I'm
asking two questions in one.

1010
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,060
- So it sounds like you're in the middle

1011
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,320
of an expensive project
and you're not sure

1012
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,153
if it's gonna work?

1013
00:39:41,153 --> 00:39:41,986
- [Man] Yeah, that's what--

1014
00:39:41,986 --> 00:39:43,228
- Okay.

1015
00:39:43,228 --> 00:39:44,630
- [Man] I have ideas
that I haven't started--

1016
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,065
- Okay.

1017
00:39:46,065 --> 00:39:46,898
- [Man] I don't wanna start anything--

1018
00:39:46,898 --> 00:39:48,340
- Oh, so you don't wanna start it

1019
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,000
and basically sink an expenditure

1020
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,650
that you can't recoup or justify?

1021
00:39:54,065 --> 00:39:55,080
- [Man] (indistinct
talking) later in life,

1022
00:39:56,305 --> 00:39:57,740
maybe a few years when I graduate.

1023
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,970
- What is it?

1024
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,660
- [Man] I don't know
yet, I have a few things.

1025
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,821
- Okay.

1026
00:40:01,821 --> 00:40:03,651
- [Man] It's just everything
(mumbles) is expensive.

1027
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,220
- Well, when I started out.

1028
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,020
I definitely started small.

1029
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,550
I talked about that Atari
portable that I made,

1030
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,890
and I remember driving back from Best Buy

1031
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:16,879
with this $190 pocket TV
in my car seat next to me

1032
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,537
thinking, oh man did I
just waster $190 on this?

1033
00:40:20,537 --> 00:40:21,370
- [Man] Yeah.

1034
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,479
- What if it doesn't work out

1035
00:40:22,479 --> 00:40:24,970
and then I've made God know
how much money since then?

1036
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,776
Well IRS knows, I suppose but--

1037
00:40:26,777 --> 00:40:28,473
(audience laughing)

1038
00:40:28,473 --> 00:40:30,600
There's always an inherent risk,

1039
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,415
but you should manage that risk.

1040
00:40:32,415 --> 00:40:37,415
$190, even back then
when I was making $25,000

1041
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,493
a year or whatever.

1042
00:40:38,493 --> 00:40:40,529
It wasn't like it was gonna
bankrupt me or anything

1043
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,273
but I would have been pissed

1044
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,090
if $190 got flushed down the drain.

1045
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:49,020
I have a pixel phone died
and I got pissed about $600

1046
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,215
going down the drain.

1047
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:51,975
- [Man] You gotta balance,

1048
00:40:51,975 --> 00:40:54,598
so maybe this is (mumbles)
should go in there.

1049
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,041
- Yes, I would say that.

1050
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:59,350
It's like investing or gambling.

1051
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,549
Don't gamble more than
you can afford to lose.

1052
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:04,337
And I would say if you're
getting started out in hacking

1053
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:05,509
and I still wreck stuff

1054
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:08,380
and I certainly wreck
more things in the past.

1055
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,732
So I would say yeah, start small.

1056
00:41:10,732 --> 00:41:12,640
We mentioned video games.

1057
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,129
Video games, a lot of those
consoles are fairly cheap,

1058
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,480
and so if you wanna get into stuff.

1059
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,840
Find something that's cheap and plentiful

1060
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,180
and cut your teeth there.

1061
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,589
Learn the ropes there and then
move onto the more expensive

1062
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,690
things where failure could be detrimental.

1063
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,413
- [Man] Thank you.

1064
00:41:26,413 --> 00:41:28,538
- Got a few more minutes right 45.

1065
00:41:28,538 --> 00:41:30,280
- [Man] Yeah, a couple more.

1066
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,890
- Couple more before they get the hook.

1067
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:33,723
Anyone else?

1068
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:36,930
Yes sir.

1069
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:37,763
- [Man] What's next?

1070
00:41:37,763 --> 00:41:38,846
- Nice shirt.

1071
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:44,510
- [Man] What's next for the
Raspberry Pi or Element 14?

1072
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,009
- So they did a Hack like Heck challenge,

1073
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,370
so basically since I'm leaving.

1074
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,450
They're finding new content creators.

1075
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,810
- [Man] No, what's next for
the device or (mumbles)?

1076
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:57,480
- Oh, the Raspberry Pi
portable device that we made?

1077
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,500
I'm working in trying to basically come up

1078
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,440
with a carrier board for that,

1079
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,250
so we can sell it as a kit.

1080
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,210
I know Element 14 doesn't
like the Raspberry Pi Zero

1081
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:07,310
because it's a $5 device
that does not cost $5.

1082
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,050
Like movie pass but so basically

1083
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:12,956
it would be a carrier board.

1084
00:42:12,956 --> 00:42:17,956
It would have the lipo
charger, the what's it called?

1085
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:25,030
The USB hub basically all that
stuff we've built on one PCB.

1086
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,170
You plug into Raspberry Pi
and you plug an LCD into it,

1087
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,340
and you can approximate
what we did on the show.

1088
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,060
The thing I'm struggling with

1089
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:34,660
is I'm not sure if we can make
it as slim in this direction

1090
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,399
as we did on the show if it's
something that plugs together.

1091
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,233
'Cause you see all those things

1092
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:40,620
like those eight-fruit boards
that plug into Raspberry Pi.

1093
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,009
They add up in thickness really quick

1094
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,180
whereas the thing that Felix and I built.

1095
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,410
We actually built two more of
them because we were so happy

1096
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:49,200
with it because Element 14
will of course do a giveaway

1097
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,169
of the one we built.

1098
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,060
But Felix and I are we want our own.

1099
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,290
That doesn't happen very often.

1100
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,090
That we actually duplicate the project.

1101
00:42:56,885 --> 00:42:58,180
So actually next week
is what I'm working on.

1102
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,850
We're working on trying
to figure out basically

1103
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,240
a PCB that we can make as a kit.

1104
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,330
So you can plug it in and very quickly

1105
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,870
have your Raspberry Pi be a game system.

1106
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:07,670
And of course I told them,
everyone loves video games.

1107
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,227
So if you make it like, oh it's a game

1108
00:43:09,227 --> 00:43:11,299
then people are more excited about it

1109
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,320
than just some carrier board.

1110
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,770
Do you have time for one
more or should we leave.

1111
00:43:17,024 --> 00:43:18,370
- [Man] You could do one more.

1112
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:21,620
- One more question, yes sir.

1113
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,440
- [Man] What would you say
is the most important skill

1114
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,200
to get started, anywhere form
soldering the circuit board,

1115
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,569
making a 3D printing?

1116
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,752
- Soldering.

1117
00:43:29,752 --> 00:43:30,585
- [Man] Soldering?

1118
00:43:30,585 --> 00:43:35,585
- Yes, yeah I started
when I was 10, I think,

1119
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:39,110
and I got away from it for awhile,

1120
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:42,250
and I would say I'm still learning.

1121
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:46,360
But you can solder
poorly and it will work,

1122
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,480
but it's better that you solder well.

1123
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,340
Especially if you're trying
to run a bunch of wires

1124
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,980
everywhere because the
thickness and massive wires

1125
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,000
is really easy to forget about

1126
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,950
when you're building something.

1127
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,509
Not everything is a great computer

1128
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,990
but you're like, oh crap,
I got all the stuff here

1129
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,500
but I don't have any room for the wires.

1130
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,160
Then you're like I have to start over.

1131
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,440
Like when we did the
Hack like Heck challenge.

1132
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,020
Actually we're sitting there
judging everyone's wiring.

1133
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,285
Actually when I was hiring assistants,

1134
00:44:09,285 --> 00:44:11,710
everyone had to bring
in a soldering example,

1135
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,840
and I totally judged them for it.

1136
00:44:15,221 --> 00:44:16,363
All right, well thanks for coming.

1137
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:20,207
(audience applauding)

1138
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:22,958
(uptempo music)
