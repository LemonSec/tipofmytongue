1
00:00:00,456 --> 00:00:02,469
(modem dial-up sounds)

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,968
(funky music)

3
00:00:28,593 --> 00:00:32,650
(television static noise)

4
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,769
- Well thank you guys for coming,

5
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,920
welcome to CypherCon,
my name is Joe Grand.

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,650
This talk is pretty interesting to me

7
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,080
because I normally give technical talks

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,280
and we'll go a little
bit into my background

9
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,640
but when Michael invited
me and the theme was

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,640
the '80s retro telephreaking
historical sort of nostalgia,

11
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,220
I was like okay well
let's think of something

12
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,949
a little bit differently than
I've spoken about in the past

13
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,440
'cause I'm normally a computer engineer,

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,669
I'm a hardware hacker,
I've been doing this

15
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,550
for my entire life as you'll see.

16
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,102
I'm a runner, I'm a daddy.

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,210
But I was like what if I put together

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,270
a presentation that talks
about the time where nobody

19
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,160
knows about except for maybe a few stories

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,560
that my wife knows, but most people don't.

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,560
So this presentation is something

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,400
that's not really meant to be a bio,

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,910
but it talks about some
tales of the olden days,

24
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,369
of the '80s and the '90s
of hacking and phreaking

25
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,630
and juvenile delinquency and sort of

26
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,289
messing around and exploring in a time

27
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,750
where there weren't a lot of rules,

28
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,110
or I guess there were, but I
just didn't listen to them.

29
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,840
So it's really goes along with the theme

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,972
as you'll see with the
hacking and the phreaking

31
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:45,759
and like Michael says in
the conference program

32
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,300
about nostalgia, like it's great to hear

33
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,320
all these old stories,
but then it's important

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,630
to take those old stories and say okay

35
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,170
well what can you apply to newer stuff

36
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,210
so my goal is not to just stand up here

37
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,559
and tell you how bad I was as a kid,

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,280
which is pretty
embarrassing, but to get you

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,290
to be inspired of like okay
well maybe I can still do this

40
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,650
even though things are different now

41
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,370
and there's new laws and new things,

42
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,360
there's also new technology
and there's new villages

43
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,320
and there's new opportunities
to do this stuff

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,910
where I didn't have the
same opportunities early on.

45
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,240
So it's still using that hacker mindset

46
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,933
just in a way that isn't
gonna get you thrown in jail.

47
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,840
So my story really I don't
think is that much different

48
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,580
from people that grew up
in the early '80s and,

49
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,580
or mid '80s and early '90s who
were involved in computers.

50
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,760
I got my first computer
when I was seven years old

51
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,420
in 1982 and was just infatuated with it.

52
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,660
And I think it's important
that people share these stories

53
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,579
and that's, again, why I'm doing this

54
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,680
because that's sort of this
lost era of the hacker world

55
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,560
before it became what it is now.

56
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,510
And a lot of, everyone has a past, right?

57
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,209
Everybody has stories
but not a lot of people

58
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,450
actually want to admit what
they've done in the past

59
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,630
and I think that's an important thing to,

60
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,410
first of all because it's fun,

61
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,640
second of all because I finally
wanted to say this stuff

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,209
but just so everybody can have a say

63
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,204
in what that history was really like.

64
00:03:03,204 --> 00:03:07,423
So pretty much everything
you're gonna see has never

65
00:03:07,423 --> 00:03:10,593
been shown before and some
of it's very embarrassing.

66
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,300
But I just found this stuff
and I was like this is cool.

67
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,970
So like I said, I got my
first computer in 1982,

68
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,140
I have an older brother
who's six years older than me

69
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,239
and he was involved in
computers, so he was 13

70
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,990
and he had an Atari 400 and
we basically would play games

71
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,610
and collect games and use
bulletin board systems

72
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,490
to talk to other people, but
he decided to become a musician

73
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,413
and gave all of his computer
stuff to me which is awesome.

74
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,890
Around that same time, he was
also involved in electronics

75
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,769
and, for me, I would
like do a chore for him,

76
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,230
I would clean his room or
bring his laundry upstairs

77
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,850
or whatever it was and
he would let me pick

78
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,910
a piece of electronics from his junk box,

79
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,109
so it was like this amazing
thing and really without him

80
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,620
I would never have been
exposed to this world at all.

81
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,700
So yeah, this is me in
let's see I was eight

82
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,660
so I guess second grade
or something like that

83
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,750
and already, that's an Atari
400 for those who don't know,

84
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,360
the retro gaming village in that room,

85
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,890
I don't know if it has an Atari
but it has this era of stuff

86
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,740
so imagine a bunch of kids
using that stuff in that room.

87
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,190
I was a latchkey kid, I had a
normal middle class upbringing

88
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,950
so a lot of you might wonder
as we start going through this

89
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,673
like how did he get over there?

90
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,760
He had normal parents,
normal school and everything

91
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,310
but something just clicked
with the hacker world

92
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,640
and as you'll see with some other stuff.

93
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,320
So I spent a lot of time with my computer,

94
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,300
it was a way for me to just
discover lots of things

95
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,670
on my own and it was
really fun, and back then

96
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,590
if you had a computer it
was something where you

97
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,849
were either really lucky
like I was or your parents

98
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,560
maybe were involved in
some academia or research

99
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,760
or something that required a computer,

100
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,520
it wasn't like it was today.

101
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,919
And it was really something
where if you had a computer

102
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,870
like you were sort of a weirdo already.

103
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,050
This one was age 10 so around 1985,

104
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,260
I still have that computer
and yeah so television,

105
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,300
I have a terminal program
running on here, XE Term,

106
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,810
which was the terminal
program, my modem you can't see

107
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,490
but I'm guessing by '85 I
had a 1200 baud modem maybe.

108
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,490
Most of my early days
were using a 300 baud

109
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,390
acoustic coupler modem, which
there's an acoustic coupler

110
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,610
in the other room also which is awesome.

111
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,190
And this was an age where
I was doing a lot of

112
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,570
game collecting and playing games

113
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,670
and that's really why I used the computer.

114
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,447
What ended up happening is
when you're collecting games,

115
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:39,110
and I've heard this story
from other people too,

116
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,110
is you're collecting games,
you want to then find

117
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,250
other games that are
outside of your region.

118
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,820
So I could call local calls
within the Boston area

119
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,420
where I'm from, but I wanted to connect

120
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,670
to other bulletin board systems,
'cause places in California

121
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,810
or New York like they had cooler games,

122
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,730
or at least that was sort
of the thought process.

123
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,340
So we had to call those numbers.

124
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,239
I originally was just
dialing long distance

125
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,730
and had to pay for it,
but being a 10 year old

126
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,223
like that wasn't a very useful thing to do

127
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:07,750
because I wasn't making that much money,

128
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,220
I think I just was getting allowance.

129
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,960
But I found a code written
on one of my brother's

130
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,940
floppy disks that was one of the codes

131
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,460
that you could use from various services

132
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,859
that actually would let
you use to place calls.

133
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,240
So sort of like a corporate
code, you have an 800 number

134
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,640
that you would dial, you'd
enter some six digit pin

135
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,570
and then you could get access and call

136
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,070
long distance wherever
you wanted in the country,

137
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,121
which it turns out is illegal.

138
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:37,130
(crowd laughing)

139
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,659
What did I know?

140
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,560
Actually I probably already
knew, but I didn't care.

141
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,210
The quest was to get the games

142
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,760
and connect to other
bulletin board systems.

143
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,969
So it just happened, just
like I never would have been

144
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,370
introduced to electronics
and computers if it wasn't

145
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,010
for my brother, I wouldn't
have gotten into the phreaking

146
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,560
side of things either so
it's really all his fault.

147
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,730
So I found one on his, on the floppy disk

148
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,460
and that sort of set the
stage of things to come.

149
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,870
Once I realized that I could go to other

150
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,110
bulletin board systems
and start communicating

151
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,320
with other people, the
hacker world at that time

152
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,630
was still very localized,
so you had groups of people

153
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,719
in Boston, in New York, in
California, in the Midwest,

154
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,980
in Texas, but there wasn't
this real connection

155
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,180
but then with bulletin
board systems everybody was

156
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,650
using codes to get access
for free long distance,

157
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,549
it's just what it was and I
think some of the older guys

158
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,130
at the time were like
we're gonna fight the man,

159
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,700
the telephone shouldn't be so expensive,

160
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,180
we're gonna do it for free,
but I think most of us

161
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,043
were just doing it
'cause it was convenient.

162
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,590
So I got a little bit into software

163
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,810
for a very brief second,
I'll tell you one story

164
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,460
that sort of pushed me back into hardware.

165
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,200
Back into hardware for
good, did we just lose this?

166
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,610
Oh, okay.

167
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,160
So this is a program that I
wrote when I was seven or eight

168
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,513
and some of you might
recognize what it is,

169
00:07:47,513 --> 00:07:49,599
it's called electric dog,
I found this program,

170
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,600
it's in BASIC and so here it
is, little loading screen.

171
00:07:56,323 --> 00:07:59,406
(electronic beeping)

172
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,993
Can anyone guess what that is?

173
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,070
It was on the label, which
you might not be able to see,

174
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,260
that was K9 from Doctor Who,
and it looks just like him

175
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,210
for a eight year old or whatever.

176
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,299
So I did a little bit of programming

177
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,120
and actually taught myself
hexidecimal by hacking

178
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,170
or modifying the binary of
somebody else's cracked game,

179
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,660
because you know they have
the crack screens on there

180
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,030
that says cracked by
whatever, I would change that

181
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,190
and make it say Joey Grand or Black Ninja

182
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,440
which is what I was at the time.

183
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,010
So just sort of experimenting, I was like

184
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,610
oh if I just change these values
in this hex editor program,

185
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,710
it changes the thing
so it was pretty cool.

186
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,500
I never got into software cracking because

187
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,190
most of my kinda passion was in hardware.

188
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,740
I found this just the other
day looking for pictures

189
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,360
and stuff, my first handle was
Black Ninja when I was seven,

190
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,060
which is hilarious because
when my son turned seven,

191
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,280
the first name he gave himself

192
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,910
was Black Ninja and I realized huh,

193
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,719
I think every seven year old likes ninjas,

194
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,790
and if they're black
ninjas it's even cooler

195
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,949
'cause they're more
mysterious or something.

196
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,350
So it sounded cool, but this was my list

197
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,210
of all the games that
I'd collected over time

198
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,410
and they were all numbered
and very anally organized.

199
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,199
I had other names too,
Astro Zombie, Auto Von,

200
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,450
FBI Agent, and ultimately
settled on Kingpin.

201
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,420
So at the time, besides
being involved with computers

202
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,290
which was a bad thing to be at the time,

203
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,410
I got involved in punk rock and hardcore,

204
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,959
woo hoo, so this was
1989, I was 13 years old

205
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,310
and so I would basically
spend either all of my time

206
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,390
using the computer and
the rest of the time

207
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,449
just being a complete mischievous whatever

208
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,150
you wanna call it outside of that.

209
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:38,219
And this is what's sort of interesting,

210
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,680
I still haven't been
able to figure this out.

211
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,199
I'm 42 now and this was a long time ago

212
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,280
and I'm still drawn to that
sort of subculture of music

213
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,300
and the counterculture of everything,

214
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,240
and I still haven't figured out like

215
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,560
I had a normal upbringing,
we didn't have the struggles

216
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,959
that a lot of people that
get into punk rock do,

217
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,190
but I'm still attracted to
that world so I don't know.

218
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,963
This combination was dangerous.

219
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,300
And this is when I sort
of knew, I'm normal,

220
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,770
everyone else is not normal,
that's how I sort of took it.

221
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,790
Also at the time, which
I think is important

222
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,040
to sort of see this
progression kind of happen

223
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,650
is after discovering punk rock which was

224
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:21,120
all about fuck everything
up, I started in high school

225
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,010
there's a lot of peer
pressure to drink, right?

226
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,380
And do drugs and go to
parties and all of this stuff

227
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,260
and I was like this is stupid,
I just wanna use my computer.

228
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,390
I don't wanna do that stuff,
so I rebelled against that

229
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,470
as well and discovered
straight edge which really

230
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,530
was my kind of direction for a long time,

231
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,310
which was involved in the
kind of punk and hardcore

232
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,630
music scene of like I'm not gonna drink,

233
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,030
I'm not gonna smoke,
I'm not gonna do drugs,

234
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,500
I'm gonna be a vegetarian, I'm gonna have

235
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,810
this clean, positive kind
of mindset and clean mind.

236
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,530
So while I was like this
very almost, people would

237
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,439
make fun of me for being
like a goody two shoes,

238
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,770
they had no idea what I was
doing with my sober clean mind

239
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,420
when I wasn't around other people.

240
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,900
And I'll show you some examples.

241
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,550
And then skateboarding also,
so this was like the trifecta

242
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,459
of things you didn't
want to be in the '80s

243
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,360
because you would get your ass kicked.

244
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,829
And this was something where
I was tormented emotionally

245
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,080
so people would make
fun of me all the time,

246
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,650
whatever it was, I had friends
that I would skateboard with

247
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,520
and stuff who were not technical people

248
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,439
so we'd go into Boston
and we'd get made fun of

249
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,740
and we'd get into fights
and we'd get beat up.

250
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,810
It was just like this really weird thing

251
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,229
and then having a computer
was the same thing,

252
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,540
like people in school
would be like oh you nerd,

253
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,550
fat whatever, like all of
these things that really hurt

254
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,050
and my sort of response
to that was like okay

255
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,511
well that gave me this thick
skin of like well I'm gonna do

256
00:11:37,511 --> 00:11:39,707
whatever I want to do and I
don't care what anyone says

257
00:11:39,707 --> 00:11:41,550
and that has sort of
followed on for a long time,

258
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,060
so that's a theme actually
of this whole thing is like

259
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,609
do what you wanna do no
matter what other people say.

260
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,160
And I think that ended up being both good

261
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,163
and bad for me, as you'll probably see.

262
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,100
So some of these stories
I talk about phreaking,

263
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,540
I talk about kind of credit card fraud

264
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,839
and stuff that seemed
normal to me at the time,

265
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,430
actually it still seems normal
to me, as bad as that is.

266
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,709
But I have to sort of
preface it with I was sort of

267
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,430
just one generation of
hacker, so before me,

268
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,660
of course, people have been
exploring technology way before.

269
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,500
I was just one piece of that lineage.

270
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,040
So I thought this one was cool, this was a

271
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,760
picture of Marconi in his
lab in 1903 and he had given

272
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,200
a demonstration to show off the first

273
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,320
Morse code transmission,
so wireless, I don't know

274
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,046
if it was a spark gap
transmitter or whatever it was,

275
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:31,560
but he was saying to the
press and tell me how,

276
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,439
this is so relevant to
today in infosec even,

277
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,060
he said I have this new
system, I'm gonna show you

278
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,430
that we can wirelessly communicate data,

279
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,900
totally insecure, nobody can hack it.

280
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,949
And there was a guy, Italian
guy, I don't know how

281
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,690
to say his name, Meville Maskelyne,

282
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,140
who was a magician and he
was like that's bullshit,

283
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,000
I know how this system
works, I'm gonna hack it.

284
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So he ended up, when Marconi
was giving his demonstration,

285
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,350
he sent his own messages over Morse code

286
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,540
to the receiver saying like
he was saying rats, R-A-T-S,

287
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,969
rats rats and then he said some poem

288
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,853
making fun of Marconi,
which was like so awesome.

289
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,460
Just that hacker ethic from 1903, right?

290
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,840
So it's like anything we do
that we think is interesting,

291
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,420
we're just standing on the
shoulders of other people,

292
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,699
so that was really pretty cool.

293
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,510
Oh yeah, so actually the
story that he started with

294
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,170
it says there was a young fellow of Italy

295
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,781
who diddled the public quite prettily.

296
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:27,613
(crowd laughing)

297
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:29,750
So there have been trolls
for a long time also.

298
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,670
Other stuff, too, so Esquire
Magazine October 1971

299
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,410
was an article that inspired
a whole generation of people

300
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,370
and before this, people had been exploring

301
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,973
telephone networks through MIT,
through other universities,

302
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,800
y'know making free phone
calls and phone phreaks,

303
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,670
or phone pranks, calling
people using the blue box

304
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,510
to gain access to the phone
network and travel around

305
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,340
using multifrequency
tones and stuff like that,

306
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,620
so there was already this
culture of telephone exploration

307
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,010
by the time I got involved and sort of

308
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,420
just took advantage of all of it.

309
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,380
There was actually a letter to the editor

310
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,150
that I found from this article

311
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,449
and this guy says it says so
much about our relationship

312
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,430
to our technology, the
union of isolated spirits

313
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,140
through electronics, the
computerized craziness of our times

314
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,340
and that was 1971, so
just you can already see

315
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,300
that similarity even to this
day where everyone's like

316
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,920
there's too much technology but technology

317
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,150
brings us together
still, but that paranoia

318
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,400
was there earlier so I just
think that's really interesting.

319
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,530
But I think also that Marconi example

320
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,490
is like what we do at hacker conferences,

321
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,600
we'll find vulnerabilities
and talk about them

322
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,730
and it's what, 115 years later

323
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,660
and we're still doing the same thing.

324
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,300
And then I would be remiss to not mention

325
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,543
the 414s being in Milwaukee.

326
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,740
Are there any 414s here?

327
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,130
'Cause I heard there
were last year, right?

328
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,448
Okay, I was hoping there would be.

329
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:56,629
So yeah, this was a group,
and there's actually

330
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,880
some Wisconsin history section over there

331
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,970
at the conference, they were
a group that actually met

332
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,020
through IBM's Explorer
Club which was hosted

333
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,890
by the Boy Scouts to let
people explore computers.

334
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,500
And they ended up breaking into all sorts

335
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,960
of computer systems that
were connected over the modem

336
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,570
and really were the first,
I would say the first

337
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,790
publicly known hacker
group and it was just

338
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:23,333
a group of 16 to 22 year old kids.

339
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,890
But that was like a
really interesting time

340
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,520
and then Wargames came out
and that inspired more people.

341
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,520
We had like the Legion of Doom, LoD,

342
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,980
Masters of Deception, MoD,
hacker groups sometimes warring

343
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,260
with each other trying to
one up each other of like

344
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,170
can we listen on people's
cell phone, normal phone,

345
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:46,040
landline calls, can we
hack the whatever ESS,

346
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,969
I don't remember what version,
can we hack the ESS switch

347
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,100
to listen in on phone calls
and do all of this stuff.

348
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,770
Kevin Mitnick, of course,
Kevin Poulsen who had hacked

349
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,460
various radio stations, hacked phone lines

350
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,100
so he could be the only person to dial in

351
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,000
to win the Porsche, so
people were doing this stuff.

352
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,010
So I definitely wasn't that
first generation of hackers

353
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,140
but I will say I think that I was part

354
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,540
of the last generation
that got to do what we did

355
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,377
before the mainstream got involved in it

356
00:16:12,377 --> 00:16:14,949
and a lot of the laws
changed, it was a little bit

357
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,630
like yes it was illegal
at the time but it wasn't

358
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,390
totally enforced and I knew
people that got in trouble,

359
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,160
myself included, but it wasn't

360
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,459
like it is today, the
world is much different.

361
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,793
Okay, so let's see some stories.

362
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:35,920
So one of the, besides collecting games,

363
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,979
what ended up happening
is after collecting games

364
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,150
that sort of evolved into,
as I got older I was like

365
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,170
okay well playing games
is alright, I realized

366
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:47,087
I'm not a good game player,
but I still loved technology

367
00:16:47,087 --> 00:16:48,870
and I loved communicating
with other people

368
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,930
and I loved the bulletin board systems.

369
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,810
What I ended up doing is a
lot more of like war dialing,

370
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,339
so saying okay I know these phone numbers

371
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,120
are known BBS's, what if
I use a war dialer program

372
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,080
to try every single number of this prefix

373
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,290
and so I would dial
10,000 different numbers,

374
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,050
usually you'd let the
program run overnight,

375
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,619
you needed a direct dial
modem, you couldn't do it

376
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,719
with an acoustic coupler, and
you wake up in the morning

377
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,520
and you have a list of
phones that phone numbers

378
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,230
that were modems, so then you
could go through and connect

379
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,440
to things and it was really
such an easy process.

380
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,370
It's sort of like if
you have your badge now,

381
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:24,649
there's actually a war
dialer program in your badge

382
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,860
so you can connect up to this USB port,

383
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,330
hook it up to the phone line and war dial

384
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,097
the telephone network that's
up in the other room too

385
00:17:31,097 --> 00:17:33,447
and sort of get that
feeling of what it's like.

386
00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:35,238
And you can do it manually as well,

387
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:39,697
'cause you could just sit there
and dial, y'know 555-0000,

388
00:17:39,697 --> 00:17:43,560
555-0001, over and over
again and see what you get.

389
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,360
You'd hang up on a lot of people,

390
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,840
but then if you connected to a modem

391
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,970
then it would keep track of that

392
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,470
so that's how you would discover systems

393
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,780
and even if they were passworded,

394
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,990
that's just the next step right?

395
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,760
Just finding the computers,
it's like a scan now

396
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,420
on the internet, see what ports are open

397
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,040
of different things using Shodan to see

398
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,703
what IOT devices are connected.

399
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,320
This was just slower.

400
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,020
So it sort of evolved
into not the trading games

401
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,060
but trading codes and
trading phone numbers

402
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,628
of things that I had war
dialed with somebody else

403
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:15,149
that would war dial something else

404
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,120
and it just became this
gathering of information,

405
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,129
I was like a hoarder of information.

406
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,200
Not necessarily to use it
all, but just to have it.

407
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,680
And I thought that was really neat.

408
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,380
Some bulletin board systems,
too, also had secret sections

409
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,050
so you had like the game trading sections,

410
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,500
if you could get to
those, but there was also

411
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,160
other sections sometimes that
would be like the hacker side,

412
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,310
and then you could trade codes

413
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,860
and do all of this other stuff.

414
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:40,710
Inside of the book, this was
the first page of my first book

415
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,050
which was the red one,
there's three of them.

416
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:46,399
They get more and more
nefarious as the years go on,

417
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,560
but this I was not even
15 when I started this,

418
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,570
so I was just fascinated
with what phone numbers

419
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,700
could you call and what could they do

420
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,430
and log in usernames and
passwords for various systems.

421
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,640
I didn't even know what the systems were

422
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,660
but just to be able to go and
explore and connect to them,

423
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,020
it's sort of like with
lockpicking now, right?

424
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,690
Lockpicking village is huge
because having that power

425
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,780
to unlock something,
even if you never use it

426
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,379
to break into something,
it's just like really cool.

427
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,383
Except I did end up using that
stuff to break into things.

428
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,960
So let's see, some of the early stuff,

429
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,180
y'know bulletin board
systems, trading information,

430
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,860
I did a lot of telephone kind
of centric goofing around

431
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,560
so I did connect to
various computer systems

432
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,409
that I shouldn't have, I'll
talk about one of them later.

433
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:34,930
But I just loved using the phone

434
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,520
and you could really fuck
with people on the phone.

435
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,590
So I actually found a
recording of my first,

436
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,730
not my first but one of my
earliest recorded prank calls,

437
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,730
I had just turned 14, some of
you guys might get insulted,

438
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,790
so sorry (laughing), so
it was christmas time

439
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,300
and being who I am, said
well christmas is what?

440
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,180
It's like Jesus' birthday right?

441
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,610
So I'm gonna look up people
named Jesus in the white pages

442
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,067
and then call them up and
wish them happy birthday.

443
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:04,930
(crowd laughing)

444
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:09,930
So let's see, I'll try to play
it, see if you can hear it.

445
00:20:14,374 --> 00:20:15,805
(phone ringing)

446
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:17,299
Is Jesus there?

447
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,420
- [Jesus] Yeah?

448
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,771
- [Joe] Is this Jesus?

449
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:20,604
- [Jesus] Yeah.

450
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:21,859
- [Joe] Happy birthday.

451
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:23,287
- [Jesus] Good.

452
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:25,674
(crowd laughing)

453
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:26,507
So my voice hadn't changed yet,

454
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:28,100
did you hear it in the back?

455
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,913
Yeah okay, so just stuff
like that, that was fun.

456
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,460
What we would also trade
are voicemail systems,

457
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,840
so one way that hackers
would exchange information

458
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,129
back in the day before the internet,

459
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,540
besides bulletin board systems
and besides meeting in person

460
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,050
which once in a while
happened, mostly around

461
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,610
trading games and stuff, is
through hacked voicemails.

462
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,750
And you would find the
voicemail box somewhere,

463
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,150
call an 800 number or somebody might say

464
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,940
hey this is a voicemail for my dad's work,

465
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,390
so you'd call that and you'd
hack somebody's voicemail

466
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,010
password, which normally is
gonna be like 0000 or 1234,

467
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,610
actually not that much
different than today,

468
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,560
except this was 30 years ago.

469
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,440
So you would hack their voicemail system,

470
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,640
you would use that as a
way to share information

471
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,940
with other people, you'd say
okay here's my list of stuff

472
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,490
that I know, leave a
message with stuff you know,

473
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,700
I'll go share that, that
gets relayed over here,

474
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,200
and you have this network
of people communicating

475
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,506
over other people's
voicemail and then you get

476
00:21:22,506 --> 00:21:25,470
the legitimate user after
the weekend or something

477
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,580
comes back and says wait a
second someone's hacked my thing

478
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,710
so they change the password
and they leave a voicemail

479
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,670
like this number, you
can't use this anymore,

480
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,999
it's my voicemail, and then

481
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:34,832
you'd just go find another voicemail.

482
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:38,400
So this recording, I ended up
finding a whole bunch of tapes

483
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,023
that Whisker from the toy
makers digitized for me,

484
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,940
all of them are now up on archive.org,

485
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,730
if you search for Kingpin
voicemail collection,

486
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,520
there's a whole list of voicemail systems,

487
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,000
I'll just play one
that's one of my favorite

488
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,250
that's sort of a short
one and you can just

489
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,390
sorta get a feeling of
like what types of stuff

490
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,090
were out there and you
can tell by his voice

491
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,439
that he was just another
kid doing this stuff,

492
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,480
so really cool so here we go.

493
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:05,258
- [Operator] Please enter your

494
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:07,632
three digit extension number now.

495
00:22:07,632 --> 00:22:10,688
(numbers dialing)

496
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:15,269
- [Mike] Hello Mike Hunt

502
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:43,133
All those would have to be freshly hacked

503
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:46,561
by a crow fly, okay
here goes the Mastercard

504

expiration date is 8/90.

505
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,508
Okay to the guy who gave that to me,

506
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:57,774

507
00:22:57,774 --> 00:22:59,506
I can get a lot of those but give me

508
00:22:59,507 --> 00:23:02,960
a number where I can
reach you or a BnB okay?

509
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,527
See what else I got, here's

510
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:10,194
474-2010, um okay guys,

511
00:23:12,753 --> 00:23:15,405
Message, fuckin messages

513
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:19,885
when you say your shit, okay?

514
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:21,700
That's all I can say
right now, this is Mike

515
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,400
oh wait here's one 1-800-234-5095,

516
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:30,090
codes are 590447 and 8148870.

517
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,360
Okay and this is Mike Hunt, later on.

518
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,060
Oh shit, keep on having more shit.

519
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,537
Okay here's a calling
card, 8919 938 7824 2403,

520
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,577
next 919 938, oh shit fuck that one.

521
00:23:46,462 --> 00:23:48,733
Sorry about that, leave what you want,

522
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:51,205
call my other box if you
wanna leave shit too,

523
00:23:51,205 --> 00:23:56,205
it's 1-800-284-2337 box
number is 2125, okay?

524
00:23:58,123 --> 00:23:59,963
This is Mike Hunt, later.

525
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,980
- So you can see he started
off with a bunch of codes

526
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,420
for doing free long distance
and then threw a credit card

527
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,830
in there, which of course if
a bunch of hackers get that,

528
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,540
that's gonna be used very quickly,

529
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,889
I'll talk a little bit
about credit card stuff.

530
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,250
And then another voicemail box to call to

531
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,830
so it was like this web and
I don't know who that guy is,

532
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,689
I would love to meet
him 'cause that was like

533
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,780
when I recorded that I was
like this guy is so cool

534
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,320
'cause I was even younger than that

535
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,340
and I was like this guy is
awesome, I wonder where he lives.

536
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,283
But I had no idea.

537
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,129
Because of using the
codes that I was using

538
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,420
which were 1-800 numbers
and I don't exactly know

539
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,540
how traceable those were at
the time and all of that,

540
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,639
doing prank calls and voicemail
hacking and everything,

541
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,550
I was really paranoid about
who was calling my house.

542
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,930
And so I created a board
which I'll show you later on

543
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,090
that was called ring busy
device, and it was a resistor,

544
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,850
just a single resistor
that would go in line

545
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,990
between the ring and the
tip of the telephone line

546
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,850
and that would still let you dial out

547
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,439
so my parents could use the phone,

548
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,800
but if somebody tried to call the house,

549
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,270
they would get a busy signal,

550
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,310
actually it would ring once
and then be a busy signal.

551
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,250
So that would prevent these companies

552
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,740
from calling and complaining
and having my teachers

553
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,140
call and complain about
whatever I did that day.

554
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,250
And it actually worked, I
used it for a long time,

555
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,320
I don't actually know
if my parents know that,

556
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,480
so now you do 'cause
they wanna watch this.

557
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,570
I warned them they probably shouldn't

558
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,320
watch this presentation
but I think they will.

559
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,230
So I got a phone call one day and I always

560
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:29,133
recorded every phone call which
is also illegal by the way.

561
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,430
But I recorded this one,

562
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,733
so see if you can notice what's going on.

563
00:25:36,362 --> 00:25:37,195
(phone ringing)

564
00:25:37,195 --> 00:25:38,028
- [Joe] Hello.

565
00:25:38,028 --> 00:25:39,840
- [Man] Hey you're busted, man.

566
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,459
You ain't got long distance service.

567
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,293
- [Joe] Excuse me?

568
00:25:42,293 --> 00:25:43,126
- [Man] Yeah.

569
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,204
- [Joe] Excuse me?

570
00:25:44,204 --> 00:25:45,767
Who's this, who's calling please?

571
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:46,600
- [Man] Huh?

572
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,433
- [Joe] Who's calling please?

573
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:49,970
- [Man] Secret Service,
federal department.

574
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,720
- [Joe] Uh can I please have your name?

575
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,375
I think you might have the wrong number.

576
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:57,526
- [Man] No we show this number 617 (beep)

577
00:25:57,526 --> 00:25:58,443
- [Joe] That's my phone number.

578
00:25:58,443 --> 00:25:59,780
Yes that is the number.

579
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,010
- [Man] Okay, thank you,
we're just confirming that.

580
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,820
- So that was sort of hard to hear

581
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,970
but this guy called me out of the blue

582
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,260
and he's like you're
busted, but he was obviously

583
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,780
also pretending to be somebody else

584
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,480
because Secret Service doesn't
have a federal department,

585
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,980
they are a federal department.

586
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,850
But it still freaked me
out, and you can hear like,

587
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,730
what I did a lot of times
too is people called me

588
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,140
Mickey Mouse growing up
because my voice was so high

589
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,330
like you heard in that other
video, so I would try to be

590
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,149
like hello this is, I'm sorry
you have the wrong number,

591
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,890
but I still had a high
voice so that was me trying

592
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,100
to sound older, which you'll
hear on the next one too

593
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,050
which I don't understand
how people even believed

594
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:38,180
this stuff, especially
when I started actually

595
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,710
ordering things with
credit cards and I'm like

596
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,163
hello I would like to order
this video camera to my house.

597
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,550
Yeah so having a high voice
didn't work out too well.

598
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:49,419
So one of the things also
that a lot of hackers did

599
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,410
was do what are called
alliance teleconferences,

600
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,670
and these were teleconference
systems that were run

601
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,160
by AT&T and businesses would use them,

602
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,540
sort of like a conference call
now or whatever people use,

603
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,629
Skype or I don't even know what people use

604
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,800
for conference calls,
Slack, no you can't do voice

605
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,250
with Slack, I don't know, whatever it is,

606
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,150
three-way calling for lots of people.

607
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,520
So it was a conference
call system I think it was

608
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,520
$5 per minute per line that
was on the conference call.

609
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,620
A lot of these, actually a
lot of alliance teleconference

610
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,649
recordings, I had some but
they were inappropriate

611
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,540
to post to archive.org and
inappropriate to play here

612
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,930
but some of them are on
archive.org from other people

613
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,840
that you hear all these
hackers, like legendary hackers

614
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,389
on the phone messing with
people 'cause you basically have

615
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:37,323
a giant group conference,
it's like IRC for voice.

616
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,310
And the way you would start these systems

617
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,110
is whoever calls in to start
the teleconference pays the fee

618
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,719
pays the money so you werent'
gonna do that from your house,

619
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,180
you might be able to do
it through other ways

620
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,820
of getting access to
some, like through PBX

621
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,750
to get access to an outdial
that would call out.

622
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,790
But what I would do
since I lived in Boston,

623
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,330
I would hop on my bike,
ride down into the city

624
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,360
into like an alleyway, I
had my lineman handset,

625
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,740
take off the cover of one
of the phone junction boxes

626
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,990
that covered like all the
apartments in the back,

627
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,040
clip on to one of those,
hope no one was on the phone

628
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,030
at the time, I'd get a
dialtone, start the conference,

629
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,660
and then transfer control of
the conference to a friend

630
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,080
of mine and then unclip,
ride my bike home,

631
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,379
and the conference would be
running for 12 hours at a time.

632
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,510
And we'd call everybody,
people from around the,

633
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:26,720
usually local but also other places too

634
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,240
because like I had my
friends and then they

635
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,630
might know somebody in
New York, let's call him.

636
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,040
This guy likes a girl in California

637
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,870
that they met at camp, let's call her

638
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,763
and it was like this
totally ridiculous thing

639
00:28:36,763 --> 00:28:39,220
that would go on for
hours and hours and hours

640
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,540
and for those of you who
remember having phones,

641
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,409
like I'm sure everybody
in here who's my age

642
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,460
or maybe slightly younger
and definitely older

643
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,210
like spent time on the phone
with like somebody you liked

644
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,420
and you'd lie in bed and you'd
talk on the phone for awhile

645
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,360
and you would do that for hours and hours

646
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,060
and like my ear would turn
red and it was just so fun.

647
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,320
So we would call party
lines like at the time

648
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,203
there were actually
legitimate party lines going,

649
00:29:02,203 --> 00:29:04,190
1-900 whatever and you would call those

650
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,780
and it would be like a,
I don't even know what

651
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:12,780
a good example is, a
forum for whatever sex

652
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,940
or I don't know whatever stuff.

653
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,050
So we would call those
and then like just screw

654
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,520
with whatever, we'd pretend
to be that type of person

655
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,913
or whatever which was
just totally horrible.

656
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,450
We would also call girls that we liked

657
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,080
and sometimes prank
call girls that we liked

658
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,820
because we didn't know how
to actually communicate

659
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,003
with people that we liked at the time.

660
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,127
So we would call them or we
would have somebody call up

661
00:29:35,127 --> 00:29:38,280
and be like hey is this Samantha?

662
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,879
And they'd be like yeah Samantha,

663
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,210
uh Joe says hi click,
just stuff like that,

664
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:46,240
and then sometimes we'd just
bring on, we'd call people

665
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,840
and the thing is like
there was no caller ID,

666
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,810
your house phone would
just ring and so someone's

667
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:53,340
parent would answer, hello,
it's like is Bill there,

668
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,770
and we'd talk to Bill for
four hours, it was just chaos.

669
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,230
One time I remember I
was in New York working

670
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,120
and got a phone call
from one of my friends

671
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,600
who was on a conference,
we decided to connect

672
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,949
directory assistance operators
from all over the country

673
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,130
together, 'cause you
know you would call 411

674
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,460
to get directory assistance
but you could also call

675
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,240
a local number for each
of those areas to connect

676
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,030
to directory assistance,
so we brought them all

677
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,562
into the conference and
then we all stopped talking.

678
00:30:19,563 --> 00:30:21,950
(crowd laughing)

679
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:25,330
And they at first they
were like hello Kentucky

680
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,620
directory assistance, how can I help you?

681
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,719
And someone else was like
California directory assistance,

682
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,160
and they're like what's going
on, this is really weird

683
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,810
and then they just all start talking.

684
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,669
So it's like we're
bringing people together

685
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,420
by screwing with them and
I don't remember how long

686
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,980
they were on the phone
for but it was hilarious.

687
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:45,280
So imagine 20 people on
the phone for eight hours,

688
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,110
12 hours at a time, $5 a
minute, it was not cheap

689
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:52,082
and companies did not like that.

690
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,379
Also AT&T did not like
that so they started

691
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,610
doing their own investigations
into misuse of stuff,

692
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,899
so I got a phone call one day,

693
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,120
okay and another reason why
the ring busy device was good,

694
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,840
my parents weren't home during the day

695
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,649
so I could turn it off and
see who was gonna call me.

696
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:12,070
I got a phone call and the
person on the other end

697
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:15,082
started naming every single
name and phone number,

698
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,850
or every single name of people that were

699
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,590
on the conference call, and
there were names of people

700
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,520
I didn't even know because
we were all using handles,

701
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,200
but it was every name
and I was like oh my god,

702
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,260
we're so screwed, so you can hear me

703
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,283
trying to act very like oh very innocent.

704
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,676
- [Woman] June 18th at
9:56 in the evening.

705
00:31:36,676 --> 00:31:41,676
- [Joe] June 18th, um,
yeah I don't have any idea.

706
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,910
- [Woman] It was a conference call.

707
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,410
- [Joe] Conference call.

708
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,809
- [Woman] Involving a
bunch of different numbers

709
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:54,800
so that not a lot of people
would be on the same call.

710
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,800
- [Joe] Um no I have no idea,
I don't have triple on though.

711
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,747
- [Woman] No something originated
from your phone number,

712
00:32:02,748 --> 00:32:06,130
it was originated from a number
in Clarksville, Tennessee

713
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:11,130
and they, y'know, included
all the other numbers.

714
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:14,149
So that the charges weren't
on your bill at all.

715
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,933
- [Joe] Um, hmm, I don't
know anyone from Tennessee.

716
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:22,520
Is this, do you know if this
is some kind of mistake, or?

717
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,350
- [Woman] Well the calls
weren't billed to your phone

718
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,179
and they won't be because
you're not responsible

719
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,892
in any way, I'm just trying to find out

720
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:31,627
who initiated the call,
if I give you names,

721
00:32:31,627 --> 00:32:33,710
can you tell me if you recognize them?

722
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,234
- [Joe] Um okay yeah, I'll try.

723
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:37,250
I'll see what I can do.

724
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,922
(beep)

725
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:39,755
Uh nope.

726
00:32:42,905 --> 00:32:46,004
- [Woman] (beep) In California

727
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,594
- [Joe] Uh no.

728
00:32:47,594 --> 00:32:50,165
- [Woman] (beep) In Tennessee.

729
00:32:50,165 --> 00:32:51,865

call from Sterling Heights, Michigan.

734
00:33:03,393 --> 00:33:06,373
- [Joe] Hm, yeah none
of these sound familiar.

735
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,367
(beep)

736
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:10,995
Uh, nope.

737
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:14,417
- [Woman] (beep) Sterling Heights.

738
00:33:14,417 --> 00:33:16,345
- [Joe] Uh nope.

739
00:33:16,345 --> 00:33:20,414
- [Woman] And the last one, (beep).

740
00:33:20,414 --> 00:33:21,581
- [Joe] Uh no.

741
00:33:23,124 --> 00:33:25,041
(beep)

742
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:27,038
Nope, nope.

746
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,753

747
00:33:35,753 --> 00:33:38,010
- [Woman] (beep) Oldford, Massachusetts.

748
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:41,680
- [Joe] Uh no I don't know any of them.

749
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,513
- [Woman] Alright, are you the only one

750
00:33:42,513 --> 00:33:44,159
that would answer the phone there?

751
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,193
- [Joe] Um yeah.

752
00:33:46,354 --> 00:33:47,825
- [Woman] Okay thank you very much.

753
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,325
- [Joe] Okay, bye.

754
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,420
So you can imagine my fear after that lady

755
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,927
just naming every single
person that was on

756
00:33:54,927 --> 00:33:58,020
the conference call, asking
if I was the only person

757
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,930
to answer that phone,
so I went ahead and then

758
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,330
started calling people and were like

759
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,960
I just got a call from
the alliance operator.

760
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,330
But that was sort of the kind of

761
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,500
stress you lived under doing this stuff.

762
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,630
And ultimately, I never got in trouble

763
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,683
for alliance stuff which was good.

764
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,140
So here's one that was a friend of mine

765
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,060
was war dialing and apparently
somebody answered the phone

766
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,009
and war dialing you normally do at night,

767
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,565
while you're sleeping, so
somebody answered the phone

768
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:30,830
and she got pretty angry
and left a message for him.

769
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,620
So here, this one might be a little loud,

770
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,837
so just I tried to turn it
down, she was really angry.

771
00:34:36,837 --> 00:34:38,050
(crowd laughing)

772
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,200
But so you'll see this.

773
00:34:42,097 --> 00:34:43,756
- [Angry Lady] For some reason
you're calling my number,

774
00:34:43,755 --> 00:34:46,953
I don't know who own that,
we might need a new number.

775
00:34:46,953 --> 00:34:48,637
Please don't call that number again

776
00:34:48,637 --> 00:34:52,076
because I will have
the police calling you.

777
00:34:52,076 --> 00:34:54,837
Don't you dare call my
telephone number tonight

778
00:34:54,837 --> 00:34:58,704
and call on nine or
whatever, wherever you are.

779
00:34:58,704 --> 00:35:00,012
I don't care who you are,

780
00:35:00,012 --> 00:35:02,315
that's no reason to call me
in the middle of the night

781
00:35:02,315 --> 00:35:04,619
and I'm gonna have the curb or something

782
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,432
and I will have them come on you.

783
00:35:06,432 --> 00:35:08,723
If you a killer, or whatever, I don't know

784
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:12,118
who the hell you are but
you don't call me tonight

785
00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:16,360
and wake me up in the middle
of the night, you hear me?

786
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,830
- So I can imagine that
happening all over the country

787
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,770
all the time because the war dialers

788
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,520
were going and people would answer.

789
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,600
Makes me nervous just hearing it.

790
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,610
So yeah were indirectly effecting people,

791
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,503
not that I feel bad about
it but it was sort of funny.

792
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,740
So this one's a little
bit of RF radio hacking,

793
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,930
so this is something, we have
software-defined radios now,

794
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:43,930
we have lots of methods of
manipulating wireless systems,

795
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,299
what we used to do back in the day,

796
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,970
this was November, around November 1992,

797
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:52,250
is we had HAM radios, and
HAM radios will transmit

798
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,350
in a defined range, so I
had a two meter HAM radio,

799
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:58,430
I think it was 144 to 146 or something,

800
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,029
HAM people will know, but
I had modified my radio,

801
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:04,520
it was in Icom 2SRA to
transmit at a wider band

802
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,580
so I could transmit from 138
to 174 megahertz or something

803
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,490
which violates the FCC
rules and I'll probably

804
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,129
get my HAM radio license taken away now

805
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,980
'cause I'm admitting to doing it.

806
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,360
But we would modify the
transmit frequency outside

807
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,830
of that range and it just so happens

808
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,210
that maybe even still to
this day I'm not sure,

809
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,040
that the fast food drive through windows,

810
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,040
the speakers were all wireless,

811
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,200
which meant you could
transmit to the people

812
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,810
inside wearing the headsets
that are taking your order

813
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:35,040
or you could transmit out the speaker

814
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,490
and really screw with people.

815
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,050
So this is one where I was in
the car with a friend of mine,

816
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,830
this one's really hard to
hear so I'll sort of explain

817
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,819
at the end but we're
sitting in the parking lot

818
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,750
a little further away, we
see a guy come up and he

819
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,823
starts his order, and then we
jump in and sort of harass.

820
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,173
So here we go.

821
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,881
- [Man] Yeah can I have two
quarter pounders with cheese?

822
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:02,745
- [Joe] He'll eat 20 Big Macs please.

823
00:37:02,746 --> 00:37:03,746
That was us.

824
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:10,101
- [Drive Thru] Can you
hold on for one second?

825
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,938
Alright, can I take your order?

826
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:20,721
- [Man] Medium cheeseburger

827
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:22,770
- [Joe] I'd just like 10 in a bag please,

828
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,353
just 10 in the bag, we're next.

829
00:37:28,306 --> 00:37:31,490
- [Man] I'd still like a
quarter pounder with cheese,

830
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,087
three cheeseburgers and two large Cokes.

831
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:34,920
- [Drive Thru] Can you pull around

832
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,921
to the second window for me please?

833
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,346
- [Joe] And also in a brown paper bag,

834
00:37:38,347 --> 00:37:42,680
I want 10 bags I'm really
hungry, I'm really hungry.

835
00:37:43,765 --> 00:37:46,095
- [Woman] Please pull around.

836
00:37:46,095 --> 00:37:48,435
- [Joe] I can't, my tires are slashed.

837
00:37:48,436 --> 00:37:50,519
Wait a second, wait okay.

838
00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:53,620
Can I have hot dogs delivered?

839
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:57,567
I guess I can't, I'll just park my car.

840
00:37:57,568 --> 00:38:00,923
- [Woman] Hey, is anyone at the speaker?

841
00:38:00,923 --> 00:38:03,506
- [Joe] Yeah just hand me that.

842
00:38:05,545 --> 00:38:08,628
- [Woman] Who's ordering 10 Big Macs?

843
00:38:10,366 --> 00:38:12,616
Who's ordering 10 Big Macs?

844
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,660
Mike, are you hearing anything?

845
00:38:17,745 --> 00:38:19,211
- [Mike] He's gone.

846
00:38:19,211 --> 00:38:20,711
- [Woman] Just me?

847
00:38:22,355 --> 00:38:26,200
Mike are you hearing anything but me?

848
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,640
Okay if you hear it again, I want you to

849
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,569
let me know 'cause I'm
gonna call the police.

850
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,540
- So the loud voice obviously was us

851
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,779
transmitting over the
radio and at the beginning

852
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,540
there's a guy that's like I
want three quarter pounders

853
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,170
with cheese and we're
like we want 20 Big Macs

854
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,796
and you can hear him go no not that many.

855
00:38:39,796 --> 00:38:41,790
(crowd laughing)

856
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:44,120
And then he drives away and
we're still harassing them

857
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,120
and we're not even there,
and we got the point

858
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,630
where we would do it and it's like

859
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,010
can you come to the window,
who's at the window?

860
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,280
And it's like I don't
have any arms or legs,

861
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,930
I can't get it was just horrible.

862
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,870
So anyway, that was just
some of the mischief

863
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,210
that we did, and like
I said like this stuff

864
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,090
just felt normal, it was
playing around with stuff

865
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:05,373
and just being a punk
juvenile delinquent kid.

866
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,270
What I also got into
was cloning cellphones,

867
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,460
and this was later on but
because of my fascination

868
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,270
with technology and with electronics,

869
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,200
cellphones at the time that
were on the Amp'd network

870
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,077
would use ESN and MIN pairs,
electronic serial number

871
00:39:18,077 --> 00:39:19,690
and a mobile identification number.

872
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,060
If you had that pair,
you could program that

873
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,740
into other phones and then use that

874
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,259
and then those phone
calls would get billed

875
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,060
to the ESN MIN account, so it was actually

876
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,540
really easy with certain types of phones

877
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,180
to load your own ESN and MIN pairs in

878
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,680
and then you could use
that for a day or two,

879
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,830
call 900 porn numbers
and call your friends

880
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,890
and everything and not get billed

881
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,683
and then change to another one.

882
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,930
I ended up selling those in high school,

883
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,330
which was a good way to make money

884
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:51,565
but I found myself in like
really sketchy areas of town,

885
00:39:51,565 --> 00:39:55,370
in like projects and I'm like
this sorta chubby white kid

886
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,810
and selling phones to people
that were friends of friends

887
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,299
of other people, but it
was actually sorta fun

888
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,640
and a good way to get
money that I could then

889
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,810
go buy electronics and other stuff with.

890
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,279
So that's sort of a side thing,

891
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,420
but just another example of this sort of

892
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,670
craziness that came out
of this hacker world.

893
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,620
I do have one request that
a friend of mine requested

894
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,180
I tell this story that isn't
exactly technical related,

895
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,160
but a little bit of physical security.

896
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,240
So I grew up in Boston, the
public transit system there

897
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,959
is called the MBTA, so
the train system there

898
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,290
where besides just hanging
on the back of the train

899
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,930
to get free train rides, which was fun,

900
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,839
it wasn't very safe so
one of the other things

901
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,490
that we would do, especially
if the train was full,

902
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,029
the train is like, I don't
know how to explain it,

903
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,250
it's like a bi-directional train

904
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,340
so you have the conductor's
booth at both ends

905
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,730
so when the train turns
around, the conductor goes

906
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,690
to the other side and
gets to the other track

907
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,110
and keeps going so the
conductor's in the front

908
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,570
of the train driving the train,

909
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,280
that means the back conductor
booth is open and empty.

910
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,560
And when the train is
full and you're surrounded

911
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,890
by Bostonians who are just
naturally mean anyway,

912
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:56,410
myself included, I wanted a nice plush,

913
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,600
comfortable seat to sit in.

914
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,160
It turns out that the locks on those doors

915
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,899
were one type of skeleton key,
I don't remember what type

916
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,630
but I grew up in an
old house that had lots

917
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,200
of skeleton keys so I just took a bunch

918
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,509
and tried each one until it worked.

919
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,870
If you didn't have a
skeleton key, you could just

920
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,279
use a credit card as a shim to push

921
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,233
the latch out of the way to get in.

922
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,740
So then you'd go and
sit, you'd push everyone

923
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,859
out of the way you'd go sit in the back

924
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,183
of the train and get your ride in comfort.

925
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,180
But then that was sort of boring

926
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,040
'cause now you're sitting there

927
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,940
just looking out the back of the train

928
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:29,070
so what we decided to do was
oh, we can control everything

929
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,723
from the back of the train also.

930
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,030
We didn't try to drive it or anything,

931
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,320
which now that I'm thinking about it

932
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,470
would have been actually really funny,

933
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,459
but you could do like the
bell, like the warning

934
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,794
as they cross over the
tracks, ding ding ding.

935
00:41:41,794 --> 00:41:43,960
So we would do that, we'd
sometimes honk the horn

936
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,180
and then we'd see the button
for PA, it's like oh yeah.

937
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,529
So what we would do is
like we'd use the PA

938
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:54,500
and you'd be like next
stop is the last stop

939
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,430
on this train, sorry
everybody has to get out

940
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,133
and then you'd hear everyone go ugh,

941
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,710
and then the train would go
err, the driver would stop,

942
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,440
and like we're in the
middle of the train tracks,

943
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,980
and then run down the
thing to try to get in.

944
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,070
Sometimes we had friends on the inside

945
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,930
and friends on the outside
to see what the conductors

946
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,950
would do trying to get
to the back of the train,

947
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,359
so we knew that they
were gonna come after us

948
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,100
but it was just so funny and we would say

949
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,683
all sorts of different stuff, as kids do.

950
00:42:20,212 --> 00:42:21,420
So what we'd end up doing is we'd do that,

951
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,890
we'd honk the horn, we'd use the PA,

952
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,770
the train would stop, the
conductor would come down

953
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,140
and we would open a
window and just jump out

954
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,350
the window of the train and
run off down the tracks.

955
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,293
So that was a story by request.

956
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,750
Sorry mom and dad.

957
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:36,495
(group laughing)

958
00:42:36,495 --> 00:42:38,580
So I mentioned earlier
that I don't normally deal

959
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,900
with software, and I do low
level programming and stuff

960
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,790
but that doesn't really
count, I was experimenting

961
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:47,070
at one time with
keyloggers on UNIX systems

962
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,490
which are still very common, right?

963
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,680
People hack UNIX systems all the time.

964
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,419
I had a keylogger and I think
I had written something,

965
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,070
I had some piece of code and I modified it

966
00:42:56,070 --> 00:43:00,133
to try to log people's keystrokes.

967
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,630
I went to a very prestigious
technical university,

968
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:08,830
I didn't go there, I mean I
went there, I didn't attend.

969
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:11,220
Went to this place and
one of their laboratories

970
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:16,189
had computers for the students
to use and computer labs.

971
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:20,190
This particular institution
had a known root password,

972
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,070
like it was a public thing,
so this was still a time

973
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:25,000
where like sharing root
access on systems was okay

974
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,080
because it's all about
trust and somebody not

975
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,873
shitting in their own backyard.

976
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,520
But being me, I said
oh I have root access,

977
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,560
I'm gonna install keyloggers
on all these machines

978
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,900
then I can get legitimate credentials

979
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,210
from all of the students there.

980
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:39,533
So I rode my bike down
to this institution,

981
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,210
ran these keyloggers
on all these computers,

982
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:46,720
and said okay I'll come back
tomorrow and grab the log files

983
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,640
'cause I didn't really have a lot of skill

984
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,339
in like network side of
things so I'm like alright

985
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:54,190
I'll come back and physically
get them off the computers.

986
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,470
Come back the next day,
the entire lab room

987
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,779
where I had installed the keyloggers,

988
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,930
all the computers were down,
like I had crashed them all.

989
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,582
And I'm like okay maybe I
should just stick to hardware.

990
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,173
And I never got any of the accounts.

991
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:12,070
So I was involved in a hacker
group called Renegade Legion

992
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:14,930
in my teenage years and this was a group,

993
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,879
we released a bunch of text
files, so we were a group

994
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,610
but it was like let's
try to share information.

995
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:19,910
The information we were sharing, though,

996
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:24,910
wasn't like it is today where
like trying to fix things,

997
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:27,320
it was mostly like here's
how you steal credit cards,

998
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,340
here's how you break into
credit bureau systems,

999
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,290
here's how you there's
actually one on creating

1000
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:35,200
a master key for master lock,
here's how different types

1001
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,100
of systems worked so it was
all hacker related info files.

1002
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,570
We did some pretty crazy stuff

1003
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,390
and I'll mention one thing later.

1004
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,930
There was also another
group that I was involved in

1005
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:45,799
called Lost which was
really just making fun

1006
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,990
of one of our friends, that
was Renegade Legion guys

1007
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:50,770
but we already had
handles, we had fake names

1008
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:54,450
of doing our hacker normal
hacker stuff and then this

1009
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,562
was like we would just fuck
with anybody, it was really bad.

1010
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,759
New hacker kids that would
come in and everything.

1011
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,533
We were just a mess.

1012
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,650
You can probably guess which
one was me based on the names

1013
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:08,453
here but I'll give you a
hint, it says Skateboard Joe.

1014
00:45:12,149 --> 00:45:17,149
Okay so this, like I mentioned,
the mischief didn't just

1015
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:21,113
take place on phone
lines or around the city,

1016
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,630
I got involved in credit
card fraud as well.

1017
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,333
And just like phones and free phone calls,

1018
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:29,560
like it didn't seem weird
because it was this faceless,

1019
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,430
the way I justified it
was like a faceless crime,

1020
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:35,069
like these big banks,
the credit card owners

1021
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:38,200
didn't get in trouble so I
mean they didn't have to pay,

1022
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,549
they weren't responsible,
just a big evil companies

1023
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,290
would front the cost so
it seemed to make sense.

1024
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:46,290
And this was before like
now identity theft and fraud

1025
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,980
like it's a much bigger deal now

1026
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,010
because of organized crime involved

1027
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:54,420
and people that are have their
whole goal is to screw you

1028
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,520
and get as much
information, this was still

1029
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,353
even though a lot of people were doing it,

1030
00:45:58,353 --> 00:46:01,023
it was still very
localized and sorta small.

1031
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,560
But I had access to credit card numbers

1032
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,180
like through the voicemail
systems and one other way

1033
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:11,100
that we would do it is through our modems

1034
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,248
since we had access to credit bureaus,

1035
00:46:13,248 --> 00:46:16,100
dial up the credit bureau
and in those little books

1036
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,752
I had passwords of the credit
bureaus as they changed

1037
00:46:17,753 --> 00:46:20,153
and you would hack the
passwords and guess them.

1038
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,900
There was a certain
string you had to enter

1039
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,000
to query records, so we would
look through the white pages

1040
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,720
and say okay who would
have a large credit rating?

1041
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,560
Or a large credit on their cards?

1042
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,340
Doctors, lawyers,
dentists, so we would look

1043
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,660
through the white pages,
that book with names in it,

1044
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,279
which I don't even know
does that exist anymore?

1045
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,920
I don't know.

1046
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,520
We would look through
those, find the names

1047
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,243
of those people, pull their credit record,

1048
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,370
get all the information about
them, get their name whatever

1049
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,470
their maiden name,
whatever stuff was in there

1050
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:53,919
and then we would call
the credit card company

1051
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,010
and say uh my name is Dr. whatever Smith,

1052
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:59,830
I'm going on vacation and
I seem to have misplaced

1053
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:02,279
my credit card, can you
mail it to this address?

1054
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,490
So they would mail a new
credit card to my dropsite,

1055
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,290
my abandoned house or a
neighbor who I knew was away.

1056
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,480
I'd get the credit card and
then we'd go on a shopping spree

1057
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,120
or we'd use it online, or not online

1058
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,220
but use it over the
phone, get stuff delivered

1059
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,819
to the same dropsite so the
billing address matched,

1060
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,120
or at least they knew that
we were at this location

1061
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,310
for some amount of time on vacation

1062
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:27,357
and then we would get rid of the card.

1063
00:47:27,357 --> 00:47:31,220
And it's something where
people can still do that,

1064
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:35,220
and like it shouldn't happen still anymore

1065
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,879
because I feel like the banks
maybe should have learned

1066
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,220
30 years ago or 20 years
ago when mischievous kids

1067
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,299
were doing it, maybe we
should make it harder.

1068
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,620
Maybe a maiden name
shouldn't be an identifier,

1069
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,450
maybe we shouldn't use
a social security number

1070
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,339
for everything, maybe we shouldn't

1071
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,070
just send out credit
cards, but really the banks

1072
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,230
don't actually give a
shit because they want you

1073
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:56,800
to spend money and they
want you to be in debt

1074
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,550
so they're gonna happily
issue you cards and then if,

1075
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:03,100
for some reason, somebody
notices new credit card charges

1076
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,930
and they complain, they
just eat those costs.

1077
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,200
It's still a winning
battle, it's like a casino

1078
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,109
where sometimes they have to pay out

1079
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:10,580
but they're gonna make money in the end.

1080
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,712
So it was just too easy
to have that happen.

1081
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:19,620
This was, took place in
one area I was 15 or 16

1082
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,859
or something, I can't believe
how young I actually look

1083
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:25,480
there where this was an
area that I hang out a lot

1084
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,290
and we started recording
our exploits and instead of

1085
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,360
having phones we had
to have a video camera,

1086
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,350
how do you get the video camera?

1087
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,200
You use a credit card and you order one.

1088
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,109
I remember being on the
phone with some video audio

1089
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:40,660
video place and I had really
loved this Sony camera,

1090
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,950
it was like this beautiful,
box looking Sony camera

1091
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:44,460
from the '90s I don't
remember the name of it

1092
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,490
so I went to order one over
the phone and the guy said

1093
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,729
you know we have this
new one, it's a whatever

1094
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:52,890
this company is, this
one's way better so he

1095
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:55,609
upsold me to a more expensive one

1096
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:58,100
and I'm like sure I'll take that one.

1097
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,980
So I ended up with this video camera

1098
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,620
so I think it's sort of
funny where I was obviously

1099
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,759
defrauding him but then he was
sort of trying to defraud me

1100
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,060
by upseling me and I guess he got screwed,

1101
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,150
no actually he didn't get screwed anyway,

1102
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,580
it was the credit card company.

1103
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,299
Anyway so I got this video camera,

1104
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,450
we started filming stuff, this guy,

1105
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:20,450
I'm gonna call him Robert because
he looks like Robert Plant

1106
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,090
that wasn't his name, wasn't his handle,

1107
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:25,817
we would spend a lot of time together.

1108
00:49:25,817 --> 00:49:27,310
Usually credit card types of stuff.

1109
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:30,009
We would hang out in this
one location in Boston

1110
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,907
where we would hang out in
this store as you can see

1111
00:49:31,907 --> 00:49:33,760
and really annoy the
people that work there,

1112
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,950
we'd just talk with them all
the time, hours at a time.

1113
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:40,580
Across from this location
was a bank of payphones

1114
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,700
which was great for us to do all of our

1115
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,759
various types of calling
people and harassing people.

1116
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,670
There was a little store that
sold like Moroccan trinkets

1117
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:51,500
from Morocco that this Moroccan guy owned

1118
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,680
and he saw us messing
around with the phone

1119
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,319
and one day he came up to us
and like what are you doing?

1120
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,740
I'm like oh making some phone calls

1121
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,899
so we ended up working out a deal

1122
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,150
where I would trade him free
international phone calls

1123
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:03,260
to Morocco to get like Moroccan stuff.

1124
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:08,260
So my room had like all this
Moroccan incense holders

1125
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:10,620
and the bells and the
hands and all this stuff,

1126
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,400
it was super cool but that's
sort of where I learned

1127
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,280
early on that's like oh
I can barter with people,

1128
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,190
I can trade my skills
for other people's skills

1129
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,940
which actually still happens today.

1130
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,670
Let's see, one other story, oh yeah.

1131
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:26,610
So I ordered a laptop
once from a well-known

1132
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,790
computer company and shipped
it to a friend of mine

1133
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:31,170
in a different state
because he had good access

1134
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:35,240
to like a dropsite, so he,
we had it delivered there,

1135
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,129
he was gonna test it
before he sent it to me

1136
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,320
and I talked to him on
the phone he was like

1137
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,430
I couldn't believe how
long it took to test

1138
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:44,640
all the RAM when I powered it
up, it had eight megs of RAM.

1139
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,940
Eight megabytes of RAM,
that was a huge thing.

1140
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,200
He ended up actually getting arrested

1141
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,750
for credit card stuff, too bad.

1142
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:54,660
And then speaking of
being awkward with girls,

1143
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,830
so Robert here had a crush
on somebody who worked

1144
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:00,620
at a record store across
the hall from here.

1145
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:03,120
So instead of just like
going and being yourself

1146
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,870
and communicating, he said
let's order 12 dozen roses

1147
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:09,779
to her at work, so we used a credit card

1148
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,640
and ordered 144 roses and the delivery guy

1149
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,960
was walking with one dozen
at a time up the ramp

1150
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,240
to put them all on the counter
of the checkout counter

1151
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,560
and it was like, it was awesome.

1152
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,750
I wish I had pictures of it.

1153
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,810
So anyway, this is all ridiculous stuff.

1154
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:28,460
So being into hardware,
this thing up here,

1155
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,550
this is the that's the ring busy device.

1156
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:32,870
When I was messing around with cellphones,

1157
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:35,230
I needed a way to extract the
memory contents from the phone

1158
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:37,530
where the ESN and MIN were
stored so I could figure out

1159
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:40,410
how I could change those,
so I didn't have access

1160
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:42,609
to a device programmer which
is like a general type of tool

1161
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:44,680
you can get now to do it so I built my own

1162
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,899
and I would just manually cycle through

1163
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,730
every single address of
the contents of the memory.

1164
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,280
Down here was sort of some experimenting

1165
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,400
with creating a multi-frequency generator

1166
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,110
because with a lot of the
phone phreaking stuff,

1167
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:58,910
you need to generate certain
tones, you your DTMF tones

1168
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,870
but then you had your
multi-frequency just MF tones

1169
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:02,420
that were the ones that you would use

1170
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,970
for the in-band signaling to
control where you're going

1171
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:07,970
in the system so blue
box type of stuff here.

1172
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:09,819
Here's one of my little
beige boxes I would use

1173
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,510
as my lineman handset,
so instead of having

1174
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,370
a legitimate orange lineman handset,

1175
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,049
I could just plug a
normal phone into this,

1176
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,660
connect these to two
phone lines in this case,

1177
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,060
this was a little conference call system

1178
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,040
so I could have little
conference call on my own

1179
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,653
just clipping onto phone lines.

1180
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:26,980
This one down here, who had
a pager back in the day?

1181
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,340
Yeah, few people.

1182
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,840
This was a red box in
a pager, and a red box

1183
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,350
is a device that would generate the tones

1184
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,799
that a coin would generate when
you put it into a payphone.

1185
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,320
So I don't know if you
remember, like you put a dime

1186
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,050
in a payphone it would go beep beep

1187
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:40,660
or you put a quarter in and
it would go beep beep beep

1188
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:44,250
and do five beeps so this
just created those tones

1189
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:47,600
and because all that
signaling was called in-band,

1190
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,319
all you had to do was have your red box,

1191
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,700
hold it up to the phone when it said

1192
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,819
please enter, please deposit
75 cents, you would hold

1193
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,850
this thing up, you'd push
the buttons corresponding

1194
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:58,060
to 75 cents and then you
would get your phone call.

1195
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,220
I sold those a lot, too, that
was also very profitable.

1196
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,980
Oh I should mention, I've
always been into buying

1197
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:05,230
and selling stuff at my parents
just reminded me of this.

1198
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:07,690
So when I was a little
bit older I discovered

1199
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:11,110
that AT&T dumpster, a
junkyard that was all

1200
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:14,410
discarded AT&T equipment and
I pulled out all the EPROMs

1201
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:16,700
from the different types
of telephone equipment,

1202
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,960
and EPROMs at the time, they're
programmable memory devices

1203
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,780
and they're used in all
sorts of arcade games

1204
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,940
and stuff like that,
not anymore 'cause it's

1205
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:27,060
an older technology but
I had dozens and dozens

1206
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,450
of those that I would sell on usenet,

1207
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:30,640
so selling stuff has
always been kinda popular.

1208
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,430
When I was younger, when I was about 10

1209
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:35,950
I discovered like an adult
bulletin board system

1210
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:38,779
and that was a local number
so of course I signed up

1211
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,270
with a friend of mine,
we pretended to be older

1212
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:42,759
and we said our birth dates
at something that seemed

1213
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,403
really old and you could download
ASCII art of naked women.

1214
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,570
There were probably naked men
too, but I didn't see that.

1215
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:53,210
So I'd have these printouts
and it was dot matrix printout,

1216
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:58,080
ASCII dot matrix on a piece
of paper with the paper

1217
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,200
on the sides, whatever
it's called, tracker feed.

1218
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,710
So I had these printouts of naked ladies,

1219
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,010
I'd hide 'em under my bed,

1220
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,560
but I ended up selling those at school

1221
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:10,700
which was one of my first
endeavors of selling things.

1222
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,899
Which was awesome, yeah.

1223
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:15,259
What else?

1224
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,270
This one here is a
universal garage door opener

1225
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:20,890
so this system is just based
on it has 10 DIP switches

1226
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,609
that you would set for
your transmit password

1227
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:24,490
that would match the
receiver and I said well wait

1228
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:25,979
what if I just replaced
that with a circuit

1229
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,120
that would cycle through
all of them automatically,

1230
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,953
so you just hold the button down

1231
00:54:28,953 --> 00:54:31,860
and it will open any garage
door that uses that system.

1232
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,020
Which is like a precursor
to doing it with wireless

1233
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,540
exploits through software-defined radio

1234
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,700
which Samm Kamkar did something recently

1235
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,660
that basically emulated this
attack plus a whole bunch

1236
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,359
of other ones of other systems to have

1237
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,360
this universal garage door opener system,

1238
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,470
so just because you could do
it doesn't mean it's legal.

1239
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:50,930
I didn't actually take advantage of that,

1240
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:52,190
I ended up showing it to my parents

1241
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:54,670
and they said okay good job,
then they moved their bikes

1242
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,010
out of the garage, so at
least that was a good thing.

1243
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:58,360
And then other mischievous stuff like this

1244
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,100
generated a really high frequency sound

1245
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,810
which high frequency
bounces all over the place

1246
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:05,049
so I would bring this in
to school in high school,

1247
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:07,130
turn it on, close it, it was a Sucrets box

1248
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:11,130
so like an Altoid sort of
thing, leave it on the desk

1249
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:13,450
and have some tissues
to pretend I was sick

1250
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:15,279
and the teacher'd be
like what is that sound?

1251
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,287
And look all over the place and

1252
00:55:16,287 --> 00:55:18,709
I'd just sit there, it was awesome.

1253
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:20,240
This is a laser listener that I thought

1254
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,740
would be cool to spy on people

1255
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,880
and so I created this to
try and spy on people,

1256
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,820
this was a credit card
copier and of course

1257
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,840
with all of this stuff
something was bound to happen.

1258
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,390
So eventually the hammer came down on me

1259
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:37,210
and I ended up getting arrested,

1260
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,570
this picture by the way
like I normally smile a lot

1261
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,390
if you haven't noticed, the police told me

1262
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:45,490
not to smile because it wasn't
funny when I got arrested.

1263
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:48,709
So this was not the first
picture that they took.

1264
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:51,560
So it was actually I got very lucky,

1265
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,070
this was a turning point for me

1266
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:55,620
and I ended up flying
to Michigan to hang out

1267
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,190
with some of the guys from Renegade Legion

1268
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,750
so hacker group that normally we'd

1269
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:01,220
mess around on the phones,
now we're in person.

1270
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,310
Being a parent now, I have
no idea why my parents

1271
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:08,310
let me do that, they were very
open with what I was doing,

1272
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:10,529
and so I ended up going
to Michigan, we thought it

1273
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:12,040
would be fun to break into a Michigan Bell

1274
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,700
telephone facility to steal
information and it was all,

1275
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,350
again, about that
information of having like

1276
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:19,160
how can we do things
on the phone networks,

1277
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,009
how can we have hardware that
we're not supposed to have?

1278
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:25,070
We ultimately were charged
with six felonies each,

1279
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:26,750
they dropped the charges
on me because I was

1280
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,770
the only juvenile, so this was the point

1281
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:31,570
where I was like shit I should
probably stop doing this.

1282
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,640
The other guys, not so lucky.

1283
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,670
I ended up going back about
a year ago I was doing

1284
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:40,470
some work out there and stopped
by the telephone company,

1285
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:42,730
took a picture and it was
really eerie to be back there

1286
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:45,570
25 years later and then
it was so cold in Detroit

1287
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,950
that my cellphone died,
so I was like shit,

1288
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:51,569
so I just followed the
signs to the police station

1289
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:52,980
and I was like this is
where I got arrested,

1290
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,680
went into the police
station, my palms got sweaty,

1291
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,129
I'm like oh my god
they're gonna recognize me

1292
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:58,160
'cause I had to ask for directions

1293
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,410
to get back to the
airport, and they didn't.

1294
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:02,370
So anyway, I only have a few minutes

1295
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:05,270
and this is really like all that bad stuff

1296
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:10,360
were experiences that kind
of paved where I ended up

1297
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,900
and I had to do a sport or get
a job according to my parents

1298
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,840
and so I ended up running which became

1299
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,720
a saving grace for me because now I would

1300
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,160
I could kind of that was my
balance of using computers

1301
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,299
and then running so that was really good.

1302
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,470
I ended up joining The Lopht
which is a hacker group

1303
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,850
in Boston with a bunch
of older guys that were

1304
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:30,100
really focused on sharing
information in a good way

1305
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:34,600
and using the hacker name
to spread the good side

1306
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,460
of what we could do, the positivity of it

1307
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,280
without breaking the law, so I had

1308
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,030
known them beforehand,
there's a lot of history

1309
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:42,930
about The Lopht that's already online.

1310
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,310
I had known them before
that, but they're like

1311
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:46,850
we don't want him to join until he's done

1312
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:49,040
doing his dumb shit and they
were right so I got in trouble,

1313
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,790
joined The Lopht, I won't play the video,

1314
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:52,460
you can see it online
'cause we don't have time

1315
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,630
but it was a hacker hangout to mess around

1316
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:57,113
with stuff not unlike
maker's spaces today.

1317
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:02,319
So we got a lot of media
coverage about trying to

1318
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,010
share what hackers can
do for the good side,

1319
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:06,040
which you should all understand

1320
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,190
being at a hacker conference.

1321
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,800
We ended up testifying in
front of Senate in 1998

1322
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,500
about the state of computer
security in government,

1323
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,120
that is of course not real.

1324
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,600
That was in the White
House press room though.

1325
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,880
I do want to play this as
sort of the final thing

1326
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,630
because it's pretty funny,
this was Conan O'Brien

1327
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,420
the day after our Senate testimony

1328
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:24,690
and he had heard about it
and said okay let's make fun

1329
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:27,190
of hackers 'cause who
doesn't make fun of hackers?

1330
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:30,093
- I found this, talk
about something that's

1331
00:58:30,093 --> 00:58:32,430
a little frightening I read
this in the news yesterday.

1332
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:36,600
A group of computer hackers told Congress

1333
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,470
that hackers are now capable
of shutting down the internet,

1334
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:43,439
redirecting commercial
flights, and transferring

1335
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,683
millions of Wall Street
dollars around the world.

1336
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:50,640
It's weird, yeah, which
means the only thing hackers

1337
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,944
still aren't capable of doing
is losing their virginity.

1338
00:58:53,944 --> 00:58:56,944
(audience laughing)

1339
00:59:05,747 --> 00:59:07,669
There's a guy with thick black glasses

1340
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:11,178
crying right now in the third row.

1341
00:59:11,178 --> 00:59:12,620
- And moving all the money out of

1342
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,020
your account.
- Yeah right.

1343
00:59:16,124 --> 00:59:18,020
I'm completely screwed.

1344
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,823
I'll show that red-haired freak.

1345
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,095
I don't fear nerds.

1346
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:29,095
(audience laughing)

1347
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,210
That's the bravest stand I ever took.

1348
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:34,979
I'm sorry, I might be going out

1349
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,393
on a limb here but I don't fear the nerds.

1350
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:42,410
- Yeah okay so that I
should mention that this

1351
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:44,410
was 1998 so this is just when the internet

1352
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,660
was becoming common, people were starting

1353
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:49,580
to discover technology, and
we were really at that point

1354
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:53,279
trying to show how bad computer
security was at the time

1355
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,660
and has it changed since then?

1356
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,399
No, I'm gonna skip through this,

1357
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,940
I also ended up doing a TV
show called Prototype This

1358
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,740
which was an opportunity
now to share my love

1359
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:03,229
of electronics without fucking
with people but teaching them

1360
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:05,290
how to do it and how
to build crazy projects

1361
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:08,080
so it really is something
that ended up being positive.

1362
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,700
Of course, designing the Defcon badges,

1363
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,850
the first electronic
badges at conferences,

1364
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,110
other sorts of stuff,
Chumby was like the first

1365
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:17,610
open source hackable
hardware thing, so it's again

1366
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:19,370
just turning that energy
into something positive

1367
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:21,810
ended up being my career,
like this is what I do.

1368
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:24,650
I live it, I've lived it my whole life.

1369
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:27,910
The technology has changed
but like I still am always

1370
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:29,529
thinking about things
and always questioning

1371
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:34,010
and always trying to find a
way to push somebody's buttons

1372
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:36,470
and how can I teach people
things and like it really

1373
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:39,423
is just something that I've done.

1374
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:42,442
So yeah, even though
technology has changed,

1375
01:00:42,443 --> 01:00:45,600
now there is this technical criminal more

1376
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,240
organized criminal element to it,

1377
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,870
but there's still plenty
of stuff to hack, right?

1378
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:50,240
Like we're doing retro stuff here

1379
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,689
but even with the newer
things, there's stuff

1380
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:56,520
you can do and just not
hopefully get arrested for it.

1381
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,300
I would say like the hacker
mindset is still here

1382
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:02,340
where the most important
thing that we can do

1383
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:05,640
is kind of use our passion
so do what we love to do

1384
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,930
but I think teach critical thinking skills

1385
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:13,060
and teach the facts of
questioning our world to kids,

1386
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,270
to this next generation
because we sort of already have

1387
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:18,350
our minds kind of made up
but a lot of kids these days,

1388
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:20,569
I have two of them, and
they're in the school system

1389
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:23,130
and I can see that they need to learn

1390
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:24,960
to not trust everything that they read,

1391
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,840
they need to learn to not
trust everything they see,

1392
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,820
they need to question on
their own and then experiment

1393
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,870
so I feel like that's
our main responsibility

1394
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:32,710
as hackers is to learn stuff on our own

1395
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:34,780
but then teach other
people to question stuff.

1396
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:37,050
Because that's gonna be
the most important thing.

1397
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:38,420
'Cause I know that I
want my kids to be able

1398
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:40,130
to critically think about
stuff and not go down

1399
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:45,130
the path I did but learn
that okay I don't really

1400
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:46,650
trust what this guy's
saying, I want to learn

1401
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:48,070
on my own or I want to
figure it out and like

1402
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:49,320
I think that's really
important and that's what

1403
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,420
the hacker community is, to me, all about.

1404
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,330
The history, I feel like
everybody has a story.

1405
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:58,270
I just saw Hamilton
recently and there was like

1406
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:00,190
one song at the end,
everyone's bawling at the end

1407
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:03,020
'cause it was so sad but it's the song

1408
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,530
is called Who Lives, Who
Dies, Who Tells Your Story

1409
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:07,400
and Hamilton had this amazing story

1410
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,490
and his wife spent like
50 years after his death

1411
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:12,439
documenting everything and sharing

1412
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,590
and if we don't document our history

1413
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:16,220
of these early days it's gonna be lost

1414
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:19,140
because it was before our data
was harvested by everybody.

1415
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,950
It was like this time where
it almost doesn't exist

1416
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:24,390
unless people talk about it,
so please tell your stories

1417
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:26,940
in other conferences and
sort of share this stuff.

1418
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,960
And of course this is
all my these are mistakes

1419
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,614
from my past, I maybe some
of them were mistakes,

1420
01:02:32,614 --> 01:02:34,640
the carelessness of youth I guess

1421
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,930
but I wouldn't have changed anything

1422
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:38,129
because it sort of got me where I am,

1423
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,750
I just have to apologize to my parents

1424
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:42,290
for dragging them through this.

1425
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,700
So yes thank you again,
sorry I'm a little over

1426
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,890
so we'll take questions
elsewhere but thank you

1427
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:49,902
for coming and enjoy the
rest of the conference.

1428
01:02:49,902 --> 01:02:52,819
(group applauding)

1429
01:02:55,223 --> 01:02:58,473
(dial up modem sounds)

1430
01:03:23,831 --> 01:03:26,425
(television static)
