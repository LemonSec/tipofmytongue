2
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,910
welcome to track two so I'm talking

3
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:50,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">about some cluster cracking and a not so</font>

4
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,699
new tool called mdx find that not very

5
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:58,440
many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about so don't further</font>

6
00:00:53,699 --> 00:01:02,339
ado let's have a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this the next</font>

7
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,099
slide so who I I'm Robert<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reid I am part</font>

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,960
of silence or prime which is a hobbyist

9
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:11,399
a dragon group and we basically you love

10
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,850
to crack passport so that's what we do

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,970
and we rather enjoy doing it I'm a

12
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,589
student currently / systems

13
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,860
administration and network security

14
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:26,100
specialty so my kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing yeah I'm</font>

15
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,619
all about passwords you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

16
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically at the end of the day though</font>

17
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,500
you know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a guy with a few</font>

18
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:37,110
graphics cards look into spin spin

19
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:39,630
cycles and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be on you</font>

20
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,220
know cracking passwords so sorry for

21
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,320
brian is a group of obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> patrick</font>

22
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,110
crackers we compete in all major

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,529
professional level Patrick writing and

24
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,770
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in our group view is maybe</font>

25
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">12 machines at most so they're pretty</font>

26
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,280
they can manage work relatively easily

27
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,200
however we

28
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,540
terminals and<font color="#CCCCCC"> k2 graphics cards in my</font>

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,810
basement so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> not immediately in the</font>

30
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:10,080
world to manage all that manual so

31
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,920
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was looking for a way</font>

32
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible to try and get that easier and</font>

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,780
there was an existing tool out there

34
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,280
called hash the bus and hash the bus was

35
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,770
prank<font color="#E5E5E5"> red like the idea by it was</font>

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,120
wonderful and in the beginning you know

37
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,220
I would like I said I was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

38
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,140
person in our group that had kind of an

39
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:33,000
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> with hash</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 plus everyone was</font>

40
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,440
kind of like so I'm constantly pushing

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,510
for members to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a look at how simple</font>

42
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,060
it was the handle is kind of worked like

43
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,799
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice you can just issued</font>

44
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,720
task and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your machines go towards</font>

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,300
won't ask and all were collectively

46
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,819
together which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing all man is</font>

47
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,739
awesome most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you're trying</font>

48
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:52,260
to pack many views and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

49
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:56,550
computer is possible her to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get as much</font>

50
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,920
bang out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it so one name I get to be</font>

51
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:02,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">done from one of our members and he says</font>

52
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,350
hey if I program some changes ashta puss

53
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,079
would you be interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing and I</font>

54
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,600
said yeah oh yeah you bet I'm good says

55
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:13,769
the hell out of that but so does the

56
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:16,500
development cramp up to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> under way so</font>

57
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:18,570
while the original code was worked and

58
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,970
worked well um it can take a lot of

59
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,040
lines of redundant cobalt server and

60
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,890
client side and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was mainly caused by</font>

61
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,140
the constant changes of hash cab if you

62
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,029
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hash cat in the past six</font>

63
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,250
months or a year it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed</font>

64
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,140
dramatically it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> insane how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

65
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,530
that's changed you know it's gone open

66
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:40,410
source it's gone to this whole new level

67
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:44,310
it is an amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool and Adam is</font>

68
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:46,980
amazing for me so has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> book you</font>

69
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,959
basically you know it's more fine coat

70
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,399
and a lot of developers to spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> less</font>

71
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">time tracing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through and more time</font>

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,300
developing and as developers just about

73
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,290
everyone's like oh yeah

74
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,910
that's good for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me so saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he is our</font>

75
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,060
head developer he's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop</font>

76
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,650
99% of haschke pussy and a huge safety

77
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,130
goes out to him for all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

78
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,720
blazer is our client developer he

79
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:13,590
developed<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire client and we're</font>

80
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,970
currently using and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tested it has to</font>

81
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,280
just about everything you can think of

82
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,570
and then again we still find stuff

83
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,059
that's wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it works really</font>

84
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:25,260
well right now the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also the</font>

85
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">career in order of hashes org in essence</font>

86
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,250
on work is a treasure trove of

87
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,440
information if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you crack passwords and</font>

88
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,380
this site is completely new to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shame</font>

89
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,780
on you you should know about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font>

90
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,630
the amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can get</font>

91
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,159
from here is just insane so again you

92
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,050
think you saying for putting this out

93
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,570
developing this making it what it is

94
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,300
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is absolutely awesome of the</font>

95
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,860
stuff you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get from so basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

96
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,950
dictionary and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find on hashes</font>

97
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,680
org if you run<font color="#CCCCCC"> a password on it for your</font>

98
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,719
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you run the hands of</font>

99
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,330
dollar dictionary and it results in zero

100
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,080
crack patches somebody needs one hell of

101
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:06,390
a race because that is amazing and I

102
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,620
know how to be men and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sincerity</font>

103
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:13,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">insight is crazy usually on average if</font>

104
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,380
we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know some sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of dumped out</font>

105
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,360
in the wild solid sixty percent if not

106
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,390
higher just by using the hatches out our

107
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,630
dictionary so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using it you</font>

108
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:26,669
should be so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is handsome but we</font>

109
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some upper you know multi-user</font>

110
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:32,940
environment we have concurrent workers

111
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:36,690
we have really quick tab<font color="#E5E5E5"> dispatch and</font>

112
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:40,830
our work or flexibility is amazing so

113
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:42,600
basically here if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> break this down you</font>

114
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want that user again each of them</font>

115
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,040
has their own permission levels some of

116
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,640
the Reno

117
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,770
edmonds ya gotta Jana that kind of same

118
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,630
stuff concurrent workers concur workers

119
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,690
you can have as many workers as possible

120
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,940
and they will all work on the exact same

121
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,460
task if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so choose for them to do so</font>

122
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,680
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is awesome this is a huge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

123
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,349
we're dealing with a scam is trying to

124
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,640
distribute it and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe this does it</font>

125
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:13,420
very well so just as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an</font>

126
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:17,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">example here of usage you know as far as</font>

127
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:19,180
weird or flexibility goes as suppose you

128
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,890
lost orders to come and go<font color="#E5E5E5"> as they</font>

129
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">please so you do not have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

130
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,060
dedicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardware doing this point or</font>

131
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:27,400
seven it can be hardware that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use</font>

132
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,870
for whatever purpose and then when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

133
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,440
done being used for that purpose you

134
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,880
used to practice so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example a kind</font>

135
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,710
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a complaint with system admins is</font>

136
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,810
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have any dedicated hardware</font>

137
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,479
you know how do i oughtn't answers with

138
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,300
that just for an example now security

139
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">licenses terror but you could leverage</font>

140
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,770
every computer in your office after

141
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,340
hours to crack experts not an if you

142
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:52,990
know who never come again hearing lies

143
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,299
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> horrible I kind of gives you an</font>

144
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,770
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you could potentially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do and</font>

145
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,660
you can use that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

146
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,479
cloud you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can so wanted to I would</font>

147
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">recommend it but you could technically</font>

148
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,720
put this entirely open the crowd clouds

149
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:10,180
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> having the main workers as possible</font>

150
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:12,640
and so just keep in mind that whatever

151
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,340
her clients that you have running though

152
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,010
whose clients will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be receiving all of</font>

153
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,770
the ashes all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cracked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ashes all</font>

154
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:23,200
of your earth list rules I mean

155
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,640
everything so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep that in mind</font>

156
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,810
from a security standpoint that all

157
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:34,719
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients will have very sensitive</font>

158
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:37,210
so I'm see here skip ahead right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the</font>

159
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,890
way it stands we have AC sharp client

160
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:44,349
that is it our plans are to expand on

161
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,330
this to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java and Python but right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

162
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,020
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSR</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client works beautifully with</font>

163
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,490
Windows Mac and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

164
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,340
so you can do anything you would like

165
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:55,490
young problem with men is that the hat

166
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,929
cap is not automatically come with gmac

167
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,310
binaries so you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build it</font>

168
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:02,990
yourself let's see no issue there

169
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,909
otherwise windows and linux<font color="#CCCCCC"> works so the</font>

170
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,190
client<font color="#CCCCCC"> and server communication used to</font>

171
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:10,909
implement which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> upper grades</font>

172
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:12,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it's pretty simple for developers to</font>

173
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:14,990
write clients in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own language of</font>

174
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:17,060
choice or possibly implement non hash

175
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:21,139
that tools to work with extra<font color="#CCCCCC"> seat if</font>

176
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:24,110
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so choose so let's have a look here</font>

177
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:26,509
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's compatible so medical uses</font>

178
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,240
just about every hashtag known the man

179
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:32,930
if that doesn't accuracy can be limits

180
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:36,440
however the increment mode and mass

181
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:38,958
files are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was kind of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tough</font>

182
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason why is because as an end</font>

183
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:44,750
user you see one single command and you

184
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:46,430
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to increment through all the</font>

185
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,100
way from one character to 10 characters

186
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,870
you see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one single command</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hashcash</font>

187
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,089
does not run that ass once a man that

188
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,649
has a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of subcommands and the</font>

189
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:56,899
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I asked it does that is for</font>

190
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:59,540
basically optimization that's why though

191
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:02,089
and at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day it's extremely</font>

192
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,770
hard to distribute that because hash

193
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:05,420
that doesn't allow you to be like hey I

194
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">only want to run one part of this</font>

195
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,040
subcommand I don't know how to run one

196
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:12,560
chunk of it none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is supported so</font>

197
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,089
you can run the equivalent<font color="#E5E5E5"> task and ask</font>

198
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">you pussied as we do any of these runs</font>

199
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:18,440
as well you just have to separate them

200
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,060
up into individual tasks which really

201
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,410
isn't too big of a problem this like

202
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,390
you're not like hey I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run on a</font>

203
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:27,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">mass bottle it has you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know five hundred</font>

204
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:29,270
thousand reasons so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need some</font>

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,880
terminalis you can probably any further

command you wish to be completed the key

209
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,040
base is the size leave if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you test it's</font>

210
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:46,670
not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual space sighs</font>

211
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,130
and there's reasons for that

212
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,449
hash cabin or fully understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

excellence so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately before we</font>

224
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,400
get straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the webview I'm here</font>

225
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,410
there's kind of some<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and stuff you</font>

226
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,579
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand or they get kind of</font>

227
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,740
this full picture of what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

228
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,290
happening here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what is so I mean</font>

229
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,210
anything about it so we'll have a look

230
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the output from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a client machine and</font>

231
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,140
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the progress is basically the</font>

232
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,780
progress of the current chunk that your

233
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,449
client is running the speed is obviously

234
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,920
the performance your team and cracks are

235
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,440
how many hatchet second car accident

236
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,780
last status output so that number will

237
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">be updated basically reset every time</font>

238
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:50,480
you see a line them up accepted our how

239
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,730
many hashes the server has<font color="#E5E5E5"> received to</font>

240
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,090
confirm since the last status don't put

241
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:58,190
sent our<font color="#CCCCCC"> hands as the other agents have</font>

242
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,170
cracked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cluster and have RF and</font>

243
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,630
have already cracked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cluster and</font>

244
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,270
will be removed from uncracked ashless

245
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:07,490
on the local agent so that's kind of

246
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,689
they keep all the agents<font color="#E5E5E5"> updated I which</font>

247
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,180
is really really good especially if

248
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,290
you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> like salt and passwords the</font>

249
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,540
name of the game<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're cracking</font>

250
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:16,849
passwords is reduce the amount of salts

251
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:20,689
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way you can go a little bit faster</font>

252
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:24,650
so basically if one is cracked it

253
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:26,480
stinked across all of your agents and it

254
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:29,060
keeps everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my skin fast and</font>

255
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:33,620
pretty and very nice the way you wanted

256
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:35,180
to so the Hume is how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> messages the</font>

257
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,850
client is waiting to send to the server

258
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:40,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean this could be cracked themselves</font>

259
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:44,330
this could be status updates and our

260
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:48,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">queue system basically continues hold on</font>

261
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">let me tell check no mature</font>

262
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,640
yes so one of the biggest problems

263
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:57,890
you're working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ashton bus is that</font>

264
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,560
SQL server gets overloaded very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

265
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:02,720
easily and why they did that was

266
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically because the client had no idea</font>

267
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,779
what the server was doing and let's say

268
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:10,580
the client cracks 10,000 20,000 you know

269
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:13,610
half a million hashes within the last

270
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,980
status update and yes ql servers like oh

271
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,800
man we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you texted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me right</font>

272
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,230
well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next five seconds per roll</font>

273
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,240
around in the conoco<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 110,000 more</font>

274
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,700
here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and sooner or later you have</font>

275
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">a serious</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom line going and mysql</font>

276
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:31,160
server crashes<font color="#CCCCCC"> this resulted in lost</font>

277
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,200
cracks<font color="#CCCCCC"> lost to work whole bunch around</font>

278
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,709
which in our case is just unacceptable

279
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,990
so we made it you today it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like</font>

280
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:41,869
what is the server doing is everything

281
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:45,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> continue</font>

282
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:47,270
work but will check and make sure that

283
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,979
that's river is there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there will</font>

284
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:55,339
obviously send it here's what we're

285
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:57,800
doing usually crack yo yo yo<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now</font>

286
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:59,930
with that this is a live demo so let's

287
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:07,880
hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything works okay here</font>

288
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:11,390
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much this is our UI here and</font>

289
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:19,250
let's say one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

290
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:22,370
has to put here is that so we have

291
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,510
hashtag releases what that is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

292
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,100
automatically updates all of your

293
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:28,339
clients as soon as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mash categories</font>

294
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:31,160
comes out so basically all you do is you

295
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:33,200
run the binary on crime and any changes

296
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,149
that happen has to receive or have to

297
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,370
post how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it updated so the</font>

298
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:38,959
client binary itself gets updated<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

299
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,820
any of the hashtag releases that come up

300
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,439
you put them<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the server and then find</font>

301
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,940
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Mac MacDonald</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unpacking your</font>

302
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,940
red rock which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty awesome</font>

303
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:53,310
so speaking of agent here when you're

304
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,040
adding in ages basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

305
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,569
talent for the net<font color="#E5E5E5"> firing and you run</font>

306
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,430
that binary that's the first thing

307
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:02,820
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask you for is the URL</font>

308
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,859
of your server of course and the

309
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">publisher that you have the pouches are</font>

310
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,400
a one-time voucher and basically it's

311
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,290
just a one-time password that you enter

312
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,300
in for whatever client is connecting and

313
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,819
then you know that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> agent has</font>

314
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:17,310
assented that vouchers only use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> normal</font>

315
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">single time to make brand new one which</font>

316
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a pen occation token is given to the</font>

317
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:24,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">clients for them you use the medication</font>

318
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:27,089
server from their own own and that event

319
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,700
occation deals with files hash lists I'm

320
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so basically nothing is going to</font>

321
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,550
happen unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a valid token</font>

322
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:37,260
you're probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering hey how do we</font>

323
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,790
get some answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ring because I</font>

324
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:44,250
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be my first question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

325
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:55,680
so let's will drop some md5 hashes in

326
00:14:44,250 --> 00:15:11,910
here if we get to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> page eventually</font>

327
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:14,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey okay so we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just give us a sample</font>

328
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:17,670
name our hash site and this drop down

329
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,920
all of the path in here is completely

330
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:22,560
editable server-side you can put

331
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything like in here that way whenever</font>

332
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,829
hashtag gets updated you can just kind

333
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,920
of pop<font color="#CCCCCC"> you in trees in this thing's a</font>

334
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:30,810
ride and everything like i said before

335
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,290
everything is supported that hash can't

336
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:39,359
supports binary files wv8 just what in

337
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:41,910
cash let's keep imagine but for this for

338
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,680
definitely 2295<font color="#E5E5E5"> cos you know it's nice</font>

339
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,449
and fast so<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I said before the</font>

340
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">hexose format you can help load a</font>

341
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:51,040
regular text file the MW PA for

342
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:53,050
we do not support<font color="#E5E5E5"> the oath of UVA for</font>

343
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:58,269
men because you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> WPA format is garbage</font>

344
00:15:53,050 --> 00:16:04,269
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> course binary files should be</font>

345
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:05,589
electric ripped and stomach we have a

346
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:07,420
bunch of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> sources we can do we</font>

347
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:09,759
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay some clipboard we can do from</font>

348
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,860
upload we can do from a import directory

349
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,259
on the server<font color="#CCCCCC"> only we can also give it a</font>

350
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,850
download URL and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

351
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:18,040
server wide so anything you would be

352
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:22,990
importing into nasty pussy you have

353
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,189
these options to work but for this case

354
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:34,690
we'll just stick with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the file upload</font>

355
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:37,660
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully in a couple seconds</font>

356
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:43,060
we'll have about 4,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> hatches oh my</font>

357
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:45,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">mystical here look lovely we'll see boom</font>

358
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:52,300
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go so we have zero crack we</font>

359
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:54,130
have over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4,000 uncracked so let's make</font>

360
00:16:52,300 --> 00:17:03,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">a task right we want to crack these</font>

361
00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:07,240
hashes so the command line box here the

362
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,250
commitment box basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey any command</font>

363
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,289
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can think of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hash cat supports</font>

364
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,230
an automatically outputs into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> seal</font>

365
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:16,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">island called hashtag on console so the</font>

366
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,429
only thing the UV<font color="#E5E5E5"> enter in here are your</font>

367
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,589
task related stuff you're not going to

368
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:22,929
be adding a you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a binary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

369
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,240
going to be adding agent specific stuff

370
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:27,730
you are literally entering the task in

371
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,669
the task alone you're worthless<font color="#CCCCCC"> rumel</font>

372
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,200
this set so<font color="#CCCCCC"> like for here just for an</font>

373
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:34,440
example will do like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm community brute</font>

374
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,440
force

375
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:42,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so just going to do all</font>

376
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:45,909
characters there if you wanted to do a

377
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:54,340
word list and the word lists to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

378
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:55,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">across all the ages of course we select</font>

379
00:17:54,340 --> 00:18:02,049
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> app will stay up we probably</font>

380
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:04,029
tendrils on that discuss we will put

381
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:06,908
everyone's favorite invest xt4 right

382
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:10,809
everyone loves then so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a lot</font>

383
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:13,750
scroll down here which everyone knows

384
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:15,549
and we see there's a few other things

385
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,649
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could possibly edit here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font>

386
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:19,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">the default super good I'm except for a</font>

387
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:21,399
few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> were obviously it's whatever</font>

388
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:25,330
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> preference you know your task me</font>

389
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:26,559
Chum size is basically how long you wish

390
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,289
to have your agent working on the

391
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,389
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> task our chunk of a task i</font>

392
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:32,860
should say and<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually we found the 10</font>

393
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:34,840
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you you can usually go up</font>

394
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">from there if you really wanted to but</font>

395
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,250
at times per game i only<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to lose</font>

396
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,880
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> no connection to nor whatever</font>

397
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:44,830
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way it's nice and easy to</font>

398
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,320
distribute a new chunk that's not really

399
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:49,928
weird sighs the next thing you love the

400
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:53,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">point but you can technically do</font>

401
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:55,809
whatever length but the temp is small

402
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:58,750
and it's lonely another issue with<font color="#E5E5E5"> hash</font>

403
00:18:55,809 --> 00:19:00,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">purpose was let's say you have like one</font>

404
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,460
character to character three character

405
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:05,379
for character five character etc and

406
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,080
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put all of the agents on</font>

407
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,299
whatever task was the highest<font color="#CCCCCC"> a county a</font>

408
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay everyone's</font>

409
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:13,960
on like one character well it can take

410
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:17,019
like a couple nanoseconds very much

411
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,760
that's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we kind of set it up</font>

412
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:20,710
to be like hey if this task is really

413
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,960
small like we only<font color="#CCCCCC"> group in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 agent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

414
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,809
right so then we could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh well</font>

415
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,519
these are you know meant for you know

416
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:29,019
let's say five different agents can i'm

417
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,279
five different cats instead of five

418
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:33,639
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> agents</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to one single</font>

419
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:36,760
task if one of them gets you know has a

420
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:39,490
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll say one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them gets</font>

421
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,840
actually given<font color="#E5E5E5"> the task and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then the</font>

422
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,990
rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are like oh no not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what if</font>

423
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,270
we do something we go to the next

424
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:49,070
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really slow the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to set</font>

425
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:51,110
up but and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we also have seen you</font>

426
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,480
only stop to this completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> sever can</font>

427
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:56,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">GPU because obviously so now Berlin's</font>

428
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,370
run a helped a lot better<font color="#E5E5E5"> run cpu GPU so</font>

429
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,750
we kind of separated those off from one

430
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,550
another so you can technically have two

431
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,410
different kind of pads going you have CP

432
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:06,440
machines only doing their thing and keep

433
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:09,770
you only doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> their thing but anyways</font>

434
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,300
let's let's create this<font color="#CCCCCC"> test and then if</font>

435
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:14,389
you say hey we have had created that's

436
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:16,340
awesome but it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

437
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,800
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any priority the highest</font>

438
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:21,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tasker the is priority gets run first</font>

439
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,360
there's a few other no exceptions to

440
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,770
that but basically rule of thumb is

441
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,990
whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> highest priority</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to grant</font>

442
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,910
first 20 doesn't get ran at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless</font>

443
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:33,650
you want to manually assign agents to

444
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:37,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> test so let's give this a priority</font>

445
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:42,200
of 100 and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should see some ages pop</font>

446
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:44,330
up there in seconds plug them that

447
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,880
shouldn't be a very quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a very</font>

448
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:51,199
quick task here so we kind of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

449
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,660
check out the details here so click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the Nationals leave we'll see all the</font>

451
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,910
run fun fun fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> tails you got to go to</font>

00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:00,920
yellow and comfort the bottom use t able

453
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:02,780
to get three agents<font color="#E5E5E5"> hitting there and</font>

454
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,179
right now we're figuring out how long

455
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:07,700
the task is for benchmarking the agents

456
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:09,860
to see how much compute power that they

457
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,450
have and it will calculate out how long

458
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,830
is it going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> or how long ago</font>

459
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,900

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure that there's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

470
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:45,029
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> larger but so let's get into</font>

471
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,860
some nuts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bolts like most of that</font>

472
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:48,659
stuff is already attached to this I'll

473
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:52,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into some stuff that maybe isn't in</font>

474
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:54,179
hash the bus that's kind of cool so we

475
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:55,679
can look at out of pre-configured asks a

476
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,600
lot of times in your running Hanson's

477
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,279
you probably have like a set list of a

478
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,080
let's throw in business business that

479
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:04,320
stuff you always try and some stuff that

480
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:07,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">works right so there's a way to save</font>

481
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:15,059
half son half the book here if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

482
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:17,370
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> my little notes you can see I have</font>

483
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:19,470
a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch sitting here and they look</font>

484
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:21,299
exactly like tasks right I mean they're

485
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much the exact same thing only</font>

486
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:27,029
the priority is floating and what I mean

487
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:30,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">by that is if I issue you know ID number</font>

488
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:32,669
98<font color="#CCCCCC"> up here and I want to issue that</font>

489
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:36,330
again to another of this that priority

490
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:37,980
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000 is going to be the very first</font>

491
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,418
ones give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000 and if there's</font>

492
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,309
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> task re running in the queue</font>

493
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:44,370
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add whatever is in the Q</font>

494
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:46,950
plus Phi house that way you always have

495
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:48,959
a unique ID and you can just reply thing

496
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,700
out tasks left and right all you want

497
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,260
and everything is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all nice and happy</font>

498
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:56,039
we're not confused at what we see drive

499
00:22:52,260 --> 00:23:01,889
so I don't mean kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know make</font>

500
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:04,440
these we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ring so in the new</font>

501
00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:05,908
task just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're before instead of</font>

502
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">selecting a hash list because leave it</font>

503
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:09,389
as pre-configure task we can pop

504
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,149
waterproof wanted in here it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would show</font>

505
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:13,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">up as a pre-configured task and you</font>

506
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:16,049
could issued out too many hands lists

507
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:22,139
which may be quick example up really

508
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:24,240
easy how to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so select our ash</font>

509
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:29,580
list and down if we scroll<font color="#CCCCCC"> down a little</font>

510
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:31,559
bit we see it's on a pre-configured<font color="#E5E5E5"> cash</font>

511
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,809
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just check them all off</font>

512
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:36,299
that's that's great Patroclus head that

513
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:37,520
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful and Brooks okay but</font>

514
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:40,160
we were kind of thinking

515
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,360
work but you want to fetch right we want

516
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:52,370
to blast out a buncha one right after

517
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:55,040
that because that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome so we made</font>

518
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,209
super tasks and super task basically

519
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,980
allow you to group together freaking

520
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,680
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your tasks they are able to SUVs</font>

521
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,270
out to any hash those do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have so you</font>

522
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,010
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> queue up work really really fast and</font>

523
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:05,870
the key was awesome because you can just

524
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,820
kind of move stuff around as you see

525
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,100
willy-nilly and everything will

526
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,169
automatically kind of figure itself out

527
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:15,050
and whatever it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> will get ran first</font>

528
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:23,030
but we don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see all the agents</font>

529
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:26,930
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> running together as laundry so</font>

530
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:29,800
let's make something name let's make

531
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,800
something a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer</font>

532
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,639
[Music]

533
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:39,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple seconds we should</font>

534
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,660
have at least one client connected here

535
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:43,370
and all of them will connect all the

536
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,410
chunks and although be working

537
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:47,239
collectively on single task which is

538
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,560
pretty awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you really didn't</font>

539
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">have too many options to do that other</font>

540
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,720
than you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a manually splitting</font>

541
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:57,230
tags by hand and issuing the command

542
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,790
line<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's a gigantic pain and if you</font>

543
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,290
wanted to stop one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and do</font>

544
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:03,200
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else you have to issue that</font>

545
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:04,730
jump to another client and it's an

546
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,170
absolute mess and let's say you get

547
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else you want to run something</font>

548
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:09,710
completely different or you have to

549
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,840
manage adcast sessions and a whole bunch

550
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,640
of other things it becomes a mess really

551
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,459
really fast so as to what you'd be able

552
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:20,090
to handle this you know pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> well i</font>

553
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,920
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that most of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the basics covered</font>

554
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:24,439
for this there's a few more like native

555
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:27,110
hearing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are kind of nice but</font>

556
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,480
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a hole on the time here so</font>

557
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:31,939
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get into mdx pride a little</font>

558
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:35,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">bigs and yes is a pretty amazing program</font>

559
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:42,350
and that's many people know about so

560
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:44,660
yeah mdx fine here<font color="#CCCCCC"> zweifel ended up</font>

561
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">mating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making this a long time before i</font>

562
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:49,520
sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> up for sure pine was ever even a</font>

563
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:52,850
consideration waffle made and started

564
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,530
developing yes fine then bx fine is such

565
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,969
a wonderful program and that's how many

566
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,889
people know about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i really really</font>

567
00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:02,120
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this up here have a few</font>

568
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:04,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">people always look at it so basically</font>

569
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,350
what waffle is seen is he's like if

570
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,260
someone else's don't follow your

571
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:13,520
standard pattern of like md5 and sha-1

572
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:16,370
and shop 256 water for whatever reason

573
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,110
that is and there's also tools that

574
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:20,840
struggle with extremely large<font color="#E5E5E5"> hasss</font>

575
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:23,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking the millions you know if you</font>

576
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,720
were planning on running you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know has</font>

577
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,100
that she definitely enhances long it's

578
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a lot of tools out there there to be</font>

579
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,570
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tree through that without</font>

580
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,029
crashing and without taking a ton of

581
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:36,250
memory without a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems</font>

582
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:40,630
happening and mdx mine addresses these

583
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:44,559
issues thank you well so development

584
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:47,440
friend excellent started in 2013 after

585
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,600
noticing there were some some after

586
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,720
noticing that some hand solutions for

587
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,209
ashes were them some<font color="#E5E5E5"> ashes which is kind</font>

588
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,929
of interesting we call that iteration so

589
00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:03,370
md5 inside of md5 inside of md5 would be

590
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:05,830
a cripple iteration right so the

591
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:08,110
original idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ndx finals just simply</font>

592
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:10,750
iterate<font color="#E5E5E5"> mu buck that's where the name</font>

593
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:13,870
comes from this iterate handy<font color="#CCCCCC"> five this</font>

594
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:15,970
means nice so but nowadays there's

595
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:18,039
almost 500 algorithms that mdx mine

596
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:20,049
starts and that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge number 4 and X</font>

597
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:21,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mainly because and the x value still</font>

598
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:24,370
fluid with what you can do with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

599
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:27,490
as a result you technically have

600
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:29,229
billions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of variations edging on Rosie's</font>

601
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,870
that you couldn't have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> x value based</font>

602
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:34,120
off the standard or the 500 than it

603
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:36,399
currently supports because you can next

604
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,889
ashes with her hash algorithms with and

605
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,620
hash algorithms you technically have I

606
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:43,000
mean any hash number that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can think</font>

607
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,279
of inside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> another hashing algorithm</font>

608
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,409
is possibility so the excellent kind of

609
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,179
tackles the squeeze as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine a</font>

610
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:52,570
huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> test I mean that's not playing</font>

611
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:57,700
around so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is mdx mine run on just</font>

612
00:28:52,570 --> 00:29:00,189
about everything windows linux mac OS

613

615
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,850
couple of another in and solutions that

616
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,340
are out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are kind of like them</font>

617
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:12,399
were actually better performance for

618
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:17,168
about performance per dollar they were

619
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:18,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">amazing for what they were awesome so in</font>

620
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:21,340
the x-plane consult<font color="#CCCCCC"> hansen's with very</font>

622
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:26,830
supporting doesn't say

623
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:28,000
then that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome because there's not</font>

624
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:31,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">too many tools authoring that can</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually do lines in a single hash and</font>

00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:37,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ex mine introduced the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> extender on</font>

627
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:39,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">the time you see a a password cracking</font>

628
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,070
out program out there that originally

629
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,690
came from up he was the one that first

630
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,790
said hey we have a problem with really

631
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,800
complex passwords when the output in

632
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,270
utf-8 and you name it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a way to</font>

633
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,159
output them and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

634
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:54,070
it should be done and everyone kinda

635
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:56,350
thought of it so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool test</font>

636
00:29:54,070 --> 00:30:01,000
factors of 2 megabytes long originally

637
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:02,409
created with the mdx mine so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

638
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,170
where mdx mind really<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts to shine</font>

639
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:07,030
really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of show its capabilities you</font>

640
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,920
could run one you can run to we can run

641
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,178
100 million hashes within the exponent

642
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the performance is basically the</font>

643
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:15,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">same that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome if you guys have</font>

644
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:19,600
ever tried to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> in few million hashes</font>

645
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:21,340
you realize how cubes that is if you

646
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,169
know in particular you know for this

647
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,790
example here we're running 78 million

648
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:26,290
hashes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll took three seconds</font>

649
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,960
longer than one single ash that's

650
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:31,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">awesome but because of this week is</font>

651
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,520
really really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff with this so we</font>

652
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,590
can do you know why not run all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

653
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,300
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> soul patches all the time doesn't</font>

654
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,760
matter from performance standpoint we

655
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:42,428
can can<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything into X fine and safe</font>

656
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,500
and what why wouldn't just one<font color="#E5E5E5"> list when</font>

657
00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:48,280
you can run<font color="#E5E5E5"> them all over matter right</font>

658
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:50,710
so one of the most common uses for

659
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,629
injects by it is strong multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> hats</font>

660
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:56,200
types of the exact same time and this is

661
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:58,270
ready x is really cool so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> say you</font>

662
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,660
just obtained a brand new dictionary and

663
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:03,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to run run than one picture</font>

664
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,890
through all your cash flows you can

665
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally do that so traditionally you</font>

666
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,410
know you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to run each lift</font>

667
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:10,570
separately like from the dictionary

668
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:14,200
through your finances and your<font color="#CCCCCC"> shallow</font>

669
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:16,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that your cell to use excel so you know</font>

670
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,540
what it'd be really nice to run it

671
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:22,149
through just once just one come in you

672
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:23,789
know you and the ex fine you know you

673
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:26,789
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally do that and you promise</font>

674
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:28,889
should you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run all any</font>

675
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:30,179
algorithm at the exact same time you

676
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:32,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">just feed him in the hands to air out</font>

677
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:34,259
sorry I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jack sign and then the x value</font>

678
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,029
will automatically hatch them out as

679
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:39,720
long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say hey you know Maxie or</font>

680
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:41,340
whatever so again the flexibility you

681
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the X fine you just really really</font>

682
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:46,320
good stuff so let's take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ideology of</font>

683
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:50,220
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the helpers in pero para lo</font>

684
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,559
and let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a step further so</font>

685
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,509
your pen testing team and when your

686
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,450
members was able to dump a user's table

687
00:31:54,509 --> 00:31:58,979
on a company my smell server right so

688
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:01,799
but the only thing you'll love this hash

689
00:31:58,979 --> 00:32:05,249
right here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 32x anyone tell me</font>

690
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:08,700
what everyone is no you need more

691
00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:10,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">information right and usually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you would</font>

692
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,619
do ok let's try md5 because they I mean

693
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:18,629
with 95 is a pretty solid cast I come en

694
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:20,279
dlm come<font color="#CCCCCC"> yellow could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where so we</font>

695
00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:22,289
have a list of hashes have no idea what

696
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:25,799
the elements or combination algorithms

697
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:28,769
are happy so our example dump you know

698
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,450
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's 32 bags you know then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DX</font>

699
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:33,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to handle figuring out what this</font>

700
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:35,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">is relatively easily I just throwing a</font>

701
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,720
few commands over and we'll break this

00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:39,659
down just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit the very next</font>

703
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,159
slide your rental<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of tense so</font>

704
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:43,349
everyone is kind of used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass can't</font>

705
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,119
handle the over the news<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you for</font>

706
00:32:43,349 --> 00:32:47,309
when you're cracking new example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd</font>

707
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">be like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's specifically state I want</font>

708
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:51,899
sha-1 you run that with dash cam<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font>

709
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:55,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hunger right and because of this</font>

710
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:56,279
ideology of everyone doing that and the

711
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:58,919
x value can be kind of difficult to

712
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:00,840
understand in person<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

713
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,669
at the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of help your kind of like</font>

714
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,879
well this help is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really helping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

715
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:07,289
but that's because you have to change

716
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:09,539
your way of thinking when you're dealing

717
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:11,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">with an x mark but then the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X fine just</font>

718
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:14,369
doesn't do just do this one algorithm

719
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:16,408
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do that but you can do any other</font>

720
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:20,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">than you wish and basically what that</font>

721
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:25,769
does is cover how you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is because</font>

722
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:27,800
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could do you basically tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mdx</font>

723
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:30,290
finder whatever regex you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> your do</font>

724
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:33,290
analysts so in this example here we see

725
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:34,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we're calling in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the x-men we want</font>

726
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:37,280
to search all algorithms with that date

727
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:39,230
at that age all we want to exclude

728
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,030
anything insulted because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

729
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,940
think back to our MySQL<font color="#E5E5E5"> table</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> showed</font>

730
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:46,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">in my example right in CT Styles same</font>

731
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,650
thing with user so basically mdx mine

732
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:50,990
does salt and use your separate from

733
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,670
each other so you can use the kind of

734
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,800
interchangeably as salts because again

735
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:56,360
you don't know what algorithm that

736
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,250
you're using does it salt with the

737
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">username you know as the data that's</font>

738
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:02,780
sitting in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it looks like a</font>

739
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:04,699
salt amount of salt etc and then we can

740
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:07,100
iterate up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> five algorithm or iterate</font>

741
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:09,020
five times with whatever algorithm that

742
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:12,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">is currently recognize so you can just</font>

743
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:16,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">say if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to do md5 nested 100</font>

744
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:21,350
times you can just say dash h and then

745
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:25,040
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go carrots md5 dollar sign and</font>

746
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:27,650
then say I 100 and that would be I'm you

747
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,300
bike generated 100 times you can do

748
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,710
whatever you like with this and then a

749
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,260
super awesome when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start thinking</font>

750
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,790
about stuff up hey you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

751
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,970
what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is or what kind of really</font>

752
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:40,219
weird algorithm are they using chances

753
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:43,850
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> if ash guy doesn't support it check</font>

754
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:45,199
on any fun at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> x5 products you just</font>

755
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:49,100
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell if that this is exactly</font>

756
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:51,230
what I want so basically I'm kind of

757
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,960
running out the clock<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but um so I'm</font>

758
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:55,070
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much finished by the mdx mines is</font>

not going to replace your existing

760
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:59,540
cracking software but is one of mazing

761
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,879
like flexible<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool you should have it</font>

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> toolbox if your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> password cracker so</font>

buncha guys that love cracking passwords

771
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:21,900
so with that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know thank you guys for</font>
