1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,210
okay I'm ready we are rolling okay so

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,210
you're probably thinking crap not

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,590
another deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep on I wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this like</font>

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,910
that your syllabus so a couple things

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:21,180
about me I'm a security consultant at

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:26,519
food on Hamilton and where i do

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:29,099
commercial consulting for large

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,879
companies and I've done a lot of GOP

10
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:36,750
work and the scientific notation and

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,020
collaborations for<font color="#CCCCCC"> laurent quit large</font>

19

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,408
but i will talk about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a data</font>

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,059
governance centric approach for dlp data

protection if you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

25
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:22,380
analytics develop actionable

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:26,130
intelligence so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the old peaceful</font>

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:29,759
manner we clearly still have issues with

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,390
people users taking data either

29
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,689

32
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:53,369
silver bullet when it comes to security

33
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:55,680
it has a lot of issues most<font color="#CCCCCC"> notably when</font>

34
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,619
you can play<font color="#E5E5E5"> a necktie product it third</font>

35

36
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:09,568
for users or it'll look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tea break</font>

37
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,860
things mobile kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kluge like with</font>

38
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:15,049
trying to handle ILS

39
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,230
and once you get incident data how you

40
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:22,130
develop actual information around it and

41
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:25,220
that's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more up in a man is</font>

43
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:31,970
hard especially at work environments

44
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:34,100
organizations really take typically take

45
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:39,770
a pragmatic approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> toward security and</font>

46
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:41,690
a lot of that is because companies will

47
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,280
spy all these security products and not

48
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,140
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how they can work</font>

49
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,950
together and if there's overlapping

50
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,809
capabilities and this role which is kind

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:56,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a comic that started coming apart</font>

00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:08,150
the leaves have applications and other

55
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:11,720
related sources and then you have on

file<font color="#CCCCCC"> shares and user machines or I'm</font>

59
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:25,730
running and that's really where a lot of

60
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:28,760
companies all flat you can bring in a a

61

<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually Brian us as a company start</font>

putting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot lots of rules</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then it</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">died right slots a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hands it so you</font>

65
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,179
need people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually look at those</font>

66
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,510
rules to toon those rules to prove these

67
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:50,690
false positives is the canned rules are

68
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:54,290
usually ground just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tidy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> house</font>

69
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:56,000
and you I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write people there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

70
00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:00,290
do it good do they have the right skills

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,489
to do to tune the rules to it to do the

72
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:07,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">investigations and then regulatory</font>

73
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:10,610
requirements are a positive- for GOP you

74
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,850
can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> ELP to help comply with these</font>

75
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:16,100
rights but also it creates challenges

76
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:19,579
left leg if you're trying to clip the

77
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:24,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">deploy dlp to Germany say and having to</font>

get sign up from a workers<font color="#E5E5E5"> council</font>

79
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:32,460
and because of that so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> also it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:36,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">helps you comply with like GDP are if</font>

81
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,729
you use use it right but this GOP

82
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,430
ultimately comes a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it I think of</font>

83
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:45,568
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> checkbox offer but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it can be</font>

84
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:50,699
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> plan so we kind of talked a lot</font>

85
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:54,750
about minus<font color="#E5E5E5"> CLP have issues but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how can</font>

86
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:57,960
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use GOP and other technologies to</font>

87
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:01,410
build a stronger a framework for<font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font>

88
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:05,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">protection so head of core data</font>

89
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:08,190
governance<font color="#CCCCCC"> and classification and users</font>

90
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:11,580
are not great at it but it's something

91
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:15,180
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to help train them on or</font>

92
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:18,120
through and identify where the data is

93
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:25,440
being used it where is being created and

94
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:26,909
where it's being accessed and you want

95
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,169
to understand where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data being</font>

96
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:35,940
orphaned as well so once you kind of

97
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:37,560
idiot a handle on God near the

98
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,219
governance then you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

99
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,530
combining all that data and applying

100
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:45,330
analytics do it so correlating against

101
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:52,380
other data sources are like file share

102
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:54,719
logs or database blog didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font>

103
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,979
activity<font color="#E5E5E5"> logs because then you can start</font>

104
00:05:54,719 --> 00:06:03,810
seeing movement from those authoritative

105
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:07,139
sources to the those egg whites and

106
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:11,070
other give up locations I've seen

107
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:12,870
seasonal trends you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that certain</font>

108
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:16,440
business unit course of business units

109
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:19,650
have insecure business processes and

110
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,330
start understanding how effective your

111
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,400
controls are so if you see a lot of

112
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">fealty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> incidents and then you start</font>

113
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,340
seeing a downturn when you apply a

114
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,820
notification rule or some sort of thing

115
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:34,349
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that then you can it can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

116
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,590
understand how about if it scrolls are

117
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:43,230
or alternatively use an uptick that

118
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:46,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">great other questions like I like tax</font>

119
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:52,440
how you typically see kind of deal b day

120
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:56,280
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> analytic is really nice to</font>

121
00:06:52,440 --> 00:07:02,010
private discussions with stakeholders

122
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:07,289
and frame the conversation for head

123
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:09,060
around how do i prioritize and drive

124
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:13,170
remediation of insecure business

125
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,690
processes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do we identify</font>

126
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:18,450
additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> new stages so pivoting from</font>

information protection to intellectual

129
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:30,570
property or financial data so like what

130
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:34,890
I've seen companies start doing then is

131
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:37,530
looking at joint venture data or making

132
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:44,099
sure that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out or supper</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a dog</font>

133
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:46,169
research data and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you start getting</font>

134
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,140
all of that together it<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes a lot</font>

135
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:55,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">easier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start on any you can't just</font>

136
00:07:49,140 --> 00:08:03,990
throw body at ELP and with huge budgets

137
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:06,270
starting to shrink now so one thing that

138
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:09,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've seen a lot of companies view is you</font>

139
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:13,590
automate classification of data at rest

140
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:15,719
while it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has its pluses and minuses most</font>

141
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:21,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">notably performance and false positives</font>

142
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:23,430
you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use that to the trust</font>

143
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:27,900
your orphaned and abandoned data problem

144
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:30,930
and combine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with applying a DLP</font>

145
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,000
rules would prevent classification you

146
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:36,960

tools 11 are so ready for any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

these er any riches need you to the

175
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,670
your guilty school so you can meet the

176
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:19,319
question was how does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact or host</font>

00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:56,660
or even down to late<font color="#CCCCCC"> sections of what</font>
