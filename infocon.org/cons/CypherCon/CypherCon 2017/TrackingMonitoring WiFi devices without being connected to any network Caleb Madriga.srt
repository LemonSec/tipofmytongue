2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,500
night so thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the talk</font>

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,349
topics<font color="#E5E5E5"> course it tracking and monitoring</font>

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,769
Wi-Fi devices without being connected to

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">them my name is cable magical I look</font>

here in milwaukee wisconsin my public

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,199
also a ham radio person so my call sign

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,850
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoo hat which has ended cool vanity</font>

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,329
all times are free by the way now which

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,680
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you wanna stay processing the</font>

15
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,420
payments was more expensive than the

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,870
merriment and my day job<font color="#CCCCCC"> i worked for</font>

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,020
fire eye on the man inside doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> instant</font>

18
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:11,820
response software which is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun um</font>

19
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,679
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last few years i've been pretty</font>

20
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,080
interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet of Things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,180
stuff actually before I even knew duck

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,509
was what it was called I made my own

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,270
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless security home monitoring</font>

24
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,610
system with a raspberry pi and breaking

25
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,658
open a remote control for a wireless

26
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,850
outlet a couple years I'm also

27
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,299
interested in security side I last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font>

28
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:42,089
I did like a little wild trip to app and

29
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:45,659
a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago I that kind of a deep</font>

30
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:48,240
dive into like wave processing mainly

31
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,500
from the audio processing standpoint and

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,179
it's been really interesting though

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,630
because you know you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at stuff</font>

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,729
like Fourier transforms and being able

35
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,339
to look at waves and analyze them and

36
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:02,908
you can do an amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of things</font>

37
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,560
by looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at waves so sure that with</font>

38
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,329
audio analysis but a lot of what we're

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,290
going to talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kinda you</font>

40
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,000
know kind of comes back

41
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,910
two waves are still involved with

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,680
wireless security so i've also been

43
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:19,500
really into a software-defined radio

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,750
over the last few years um you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font>

45
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,820
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little hack RF first thing I did</font>

46
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,040
was try to do a replay attack on my jeep

47
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:30,780
and it worked which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of scared me um</font>

48
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,310
most cars you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do more but so</font>

49
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,810
I've kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotten into some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

50
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,450
stuff but software-defined radio and

51
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:39,060
they got a little more complicated and

52
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:43,350
you know I thought went into things like

53
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,320
modulating digital signals from scratch

54
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:49,799
you think your map um so can i and i

55
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:53,280
just given a binary number modulated

56
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,440
pinned it out over the wireless<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDR n</font>

57
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,660
control thanks and turns out the antral

58
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,640
guests so the things like controlling

59
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,940
virus outlets by generating the code

60
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">from your mouth and sending that out um</font>

61
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:10,230
you see me in that coffee shop I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

62
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:12,390
like a ton of antenna my teenage um but

63
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,070
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> acting up format like a lot of</font>

64
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:19,799
stuff I've done over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year and</font>

65
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:23,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">mostly wireless security and I really</font>

66
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it so much fun um it feels like</font>

67
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:28,290
magic if you'll kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like one of the</font>

68
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:31,170
closest thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Magic that I seen so</font>

69
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,859
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this invisible energy all around</font>

70
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:38,609
that that permeates us sand<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a radio</font>

71
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,049
waves right and if you know what you're

72
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,390
doing it you can listen to this

73
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:44,250
invisible energy it can tell you things

74
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:48,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">that maybe you shouldn't even know and</font>

75
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:51,480
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> write magical incantations and</font>

76
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:56,519
computers you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make things happen in</font>

77
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,959
a physical world um it reminds<font color="#E5E5E5"> me of you</font>

78
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,209
nice to play diablo 2 lord of

79
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,830
Destruction it's so addictive and you

80
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:03,540
know it was the lens<font color="#CCCCCC"> of mine um you know</font>

81
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,700
like a sorceress or whatever and

82
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,250
leveling up my character and gain new

83
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,440
skill points and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> still kind of like</font>

84
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,560
that like it's just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of fun I</font>

85
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,798
can learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> new skills and see</font>

86
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,720
like magic and so I hope for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk</font>

87
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,269
to you today it will be tied up for you

88
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,820
may be gaining a new skill points or

89
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,430
maybe leveling up a skill that you

90
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:31,770
already have and maybe even gaining a

91
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:33,690
new web editor tool um and so wireless

92
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:37,500
security it's becoming more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

93
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:38,820
powerful as time goes on so you know

94
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,389
doing like a quick scan of like the

95
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">Milwaukee wireless frequencies that are</font>

96
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,169
registered<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like SCADA systems</font>

97
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:49,889
that control the sewer systems come up

98
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:51,150
which is interesting you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

99
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:55,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">have some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free month is right there you</font>

100
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,969
can see um<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in general iot Internet</font>

101
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,669
of Things stuff is like it's like plus

102
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:02,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">5,000 to all of your wireless hacking</font>

103
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:06,870
abilities because more and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

104
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:11,070
are becoming a dependent on wireless

105
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,330
communication um obviously you got

106
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,940
things like your<font color="#E5E5E5"> next home security</font>

107
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,409
system but come and give your

108
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,630
refrigerator but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

109
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,669
cars are becoming more what dependent on

110
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,580
wireless security and obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

111
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:28,200
tons<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things are you I mean Wi-Fi cell</font>

112
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:29,580
phone GPS obviously list goes on and so

113
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">today what we're going to be talking</font>

114
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:36,539
about is specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> raw 802 11</font>

115
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:40,080
monitoring and just give you my

116
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:43,860
motivation in why I started looking into

117
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,260
this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple months ago so you know</font>

118
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,690
I have a number of my security home

119
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:52,500
security devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have some wireless</font>

120
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,969
security cameras I have my ring that I

121
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,430
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> activate like I have a full security</font>

122
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,400
system where it might say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know turn</font>

123
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,380
turn if you know how many alarms sirens

124
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,289
and strobe lights will go off any light

125
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,840
will come on it's like them and but<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

126
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:11,070
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's been this explosion in</font>

127
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:13,260
the vendors and devices in IOT stuff not

128
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:16,320
everything and talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other very</font>

129
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:19,050
well um so you know some of my security

130
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,229
cameras couldn't talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my security</font>

131
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">system and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean today I wanted to get</font>

132
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:28,460
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> security camera sees motion and</font>

133
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:31,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">cimmyt activated I wanted all the alarms</font>

134
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:34,310
to come on and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> started thinking</font>

135
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,230
about well how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do that i mean i</font>

136
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,570
can try to like tap into the API calls

137
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,520
but they're encrypted I could try to

138
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,890
root the camera but like that's a lot of

139
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:46,609
work so I love a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really simple solution</font>

140
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:48,950
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just do raw 802 mm and</font>

141
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,460
monitoring and ultimately these cameras

142
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:54,020
are you know upload videos cloud and so

143
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,690
to do that they have to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> the video</font>

144
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,580
to the club and obviously as soon as

145
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,510
they are triggered they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

146
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,120
with the video as fast as possible

147
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:04,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">because if someone's broken in your</font>

148
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,940
house they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> destroy the camera so</font>

149
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:09,800
basically you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is ok if I if</font>

150
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,340
I seem a certain amount of data coming

151
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,820
from the security cameras mac address in

152
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,890
some window time ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to say</font>

153
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:23,780
that the video upload trigger the alarm

154
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:27,530
and it worked wonderfully actually um so

155
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,909
I just do a couple demos here so the

156
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:40,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">first one let me go ahead and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open this</font>

157
00:07:28,910 --> 00:08:08,720
up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a security camera in I</font>

158
00:07:40,010 --> 00:08:16,090
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody's not it has needs a</font>

159
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:16,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">visitor chair</font>

160
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:42,179
oh um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how that works really well</font>

161
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:44,610
um and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting</font>

162
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,199
you know just by looking at the number

163
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">of light coming from the mac address of</font>

164
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,220
the security camera I<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't detect</font>

165
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,910
whether it was dead in with uploading

166
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,530
video I had another so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was like</font>

167
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,360
sweet that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> Al and I was awesome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

168
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:00,660
one interesting thing about this won't

169
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into the details in a second um but</font>

170
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">I didn't have to be connected to my</font>

171
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:09,570
Wi-Fi see that because i'm actually at

172
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:11,280
the raw<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 2011 data level um and you</font>

173
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:15,450
know it hit me like it's interesting

174
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:18,870
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could potentially see motion</font>

175
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:21,480
detection in neighbors houses if they

176
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,670
have security cameras and actually when

177
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,460
I was looking at this um the security

178
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:28,380
camera that i had um I actually you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

179
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,660
when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing and I I armed it and</font>

180
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,120
then tried it and then I was testing it

181
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,670
when it was not armed when it was in

182
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,770
home<font color="#E5E5E5"> mode and it was still uploading the</font>

183
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:41,250
video when it's all motion so that was

184
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:44,310
kind of a surprise um and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was the</font>

185
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,990
canary camera nut in their settings you

186
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,180
can actually disable that which leads to

187
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,590
give you that control but it was cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

188
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,390
was like I found this saying this

189
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:57,030
feature accidentally um but you know

190
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,760
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this looking at not having to</font>

191
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:02,280
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> connected to a Wi-Fi device and being</font>

192
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,430
able to track traffic from mac addresses

193
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,569
um I found you know I thought thinking

194
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,949
about it there's other interesting

195
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,860
things you could do such as track people

196
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,870
um you know like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to track</font>

197
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,490
when my wife got home luck it would be

198
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">great if I was in an office</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I could</font>

199
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,560
track with my bosses in the office but

200
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,470
um I were component anyway here's a

201
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:27,869
quick little demo of tracking a cell

202
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:29,670
phone i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> using tracker jacker and so</font>

203
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:37,230
this was i'm going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

204
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:40,439
I'll just uh mute this so so basically

205
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:42,600
almost talk to us so I was I have my

206
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,220
cell<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone and I had my cell phone in</font>

207
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,310
airplane mode<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright had white high off</font>

208
00:10:44,220 --> 00:11:03,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">feather and so you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see i would i</font>

209
00:10:47,310 --> 00:11:23,609
have my do you guys pull it up there

210
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:28,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and we're back on um so anyway um</font>

211
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:29,970
yes if you really funny someone's trying

212
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:36,480
to hack the wireless right now

213
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:38,880
congratulations so anyway my phone was

214
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,100
in at Wi-Fi off you know you can see

215
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,780
drove ice your bikes and it was

216
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,920
gathering<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the 10-second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> window and</font>

217
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:53,250
watch as soon as I turn on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wi-Fi the</font>

218
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:56,490
same press the button I look really

219
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,890
serious and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there you are so it detected</font>

220
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:04,320
almost almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> instant which is pretty</font>

221
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:05,970
cool um so um and you know based a just

222
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,500
had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 by threshold set up so it might</font>

223
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:12,840
be any data from this<font color="#E5E5E5"> MAC address</font>

224
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:14,400
consider it detective um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's</font>

225
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,250
get out how this actually works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how</font>

226
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can do it if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so like a</font>

227
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:23,190
primer and a refresher on how Wi-Fi

228
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:25,949
works from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> radio perspective um so</font>

229
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:28,410
you know it's ultimately all just radio

230
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:30,450
so a wireless adapter<font color="#E5E5E5"> is cool it's just</font>

231
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,490
a radio that<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain operates at certain</font>

232
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,100
frequencies and you have various

233
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:37,500
channels which are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just define</font>

234
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,240
frequencies that everyone agreed upon

235
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,540
there may be some other minor things

236
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,149
that I mean idea

237
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,980
endo you have multiple access points

238
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:47,329
nearby<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully the running for</font>

239
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,240
channels and then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't collide</font>

240
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:51,709
there's various you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> channels</font>

241
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,079
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have certain frequency</font>

242
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:58,609
definitions for<font color="#E5E5E5"> two point four and five</font>

243
00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:00,949
gigahertz which are the two main ones on

244
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:04,850
the 2.4 gigahertz often the channels

245
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:07,670
overlap thankfully on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 5 gigahertz lee</font>

246
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">jones as much oh and then so you know</font>

247
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just radio and ultimately it</font>

248
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:16,399
modulates digital data over those radio

249
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:22,190
waves a bit beyond open this talk but

250
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:24,829
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool stuff ok so monitoring</font>

251
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,480
first promiscuous<font color="#E5E5E5"> mode um can I see a</font>

252
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:29,060
show of hands of like who's done some

253
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,910
kind of like Wi-Fi hack can reuse

254
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:36,079
promiscuous mode<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok good number of</font>

255
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:40,579
people and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done monitor</font>

256
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:42,410
mode all right fuel us and hopefully all

257
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:44,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">the people could have that monitor mode</font>

258
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,100
of the difference but just to explore

259
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,839
the difference between monitor modem

260
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,250
promiscuous<font color="#CCCCCC"> locust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> personally I got</font>

261
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,410
into this I didn't quite understand it

262
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:54,589
so promiscuous mode ultimately you're

263
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:58,790
connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain access point and</font>

264
00:13:54,589 --> 00:14:02,180
SSID and you know typically your Wi-Fi

265
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:06,139
too by the way normally works um it says

266
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:09,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok if I see a packet that's address to</font>

267
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:12,589
my mac address then process it otherwise

268
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:15,138
this card and promiscuous mode based it

269
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:18,920
just says I don't care who is the dress

270
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:21,829
to I want it um and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get all</font>

271
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,449
the packets on a given SSID but

272
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:24,620
something to keep in mind when you can

273
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:27,019
end when you connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a wireless</font>

274
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:30,709
network you're actually getting a

275
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:32,689
cryptography key and that way you can

276
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:35,180
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> read all of the packets to an</font>

277
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:38,089
extent at the data access layer you can

278
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,410
read the package and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> outside</font>

279
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:42,170
the network you don't have that

280
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:46,610
encryption event at cryptography key<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

281
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:48,670
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can only look at traffic from the</font>

282
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:54,760
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you or attached to</font>

283
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:57,370
a promiscuous mode now in monitor mode

284
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:01,000
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> different in monitor mode you</font>

285
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:03,790
don't connect to any Wi-Fi access point

286
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,850
instead you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just getting the wrong</font>

287
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:10,240
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving the raw radio data out of</font>

288
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:12,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the air now something to keep in mind</font>

289
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,470
about this is again and it said it's

290
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:18,910
encrypted so anytime you're using any

291
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:21,040
kind of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know um SSID if you connect</font>

292
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,959
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it encrypts the data and people</font>

293
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">out time to network can't read it unless</font>

294
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,370
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting stuff but anyway a</font>

295
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:30,310
mantra mode we're just getting the

296
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:37,480
encrypted data along with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meta data</font>

297
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:38,920
so how<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that useful to us um when I</font>

298
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,960
need to monitor mode all the time does

299
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,400
it's encrypted um so here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

300
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,580
that you know I thought oh that you kind

301
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,680
of get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of monitor mode raw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 802 10 11</font>

302
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:50,800
captures you can implicitly at the time

303
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,140
a packet with sense of course just<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

304
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,849
some time that you receive<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you can</font>

305
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:58,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the mac address that it was from the</font>

306
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:00,670
mac address that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's to the bssid which</font>

307
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:04,750
is the access points not the dress

308
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:07,449
basically the SSID and sometimes the

309
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:09,880
essid but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting into that and you</font>

310
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,650
can also get the encrypted data I which

311
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,920
probably won't be useful to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you unless</font>

312
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:18,010
you can decrypt it um and you also

313
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:20,199
because it's a radio your wireless card

314
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:24,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually can see the signal string of</font>

315
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:27,550
any given message that<font color="#E5E5E5"> receives so</font>

316
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:31,540
implicitly<font color="#CCCCCC"> and potentially to do some</font>

317
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:34,810
level of physical proximity from that um

318
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know what can you do with as well as</font>

319
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:39,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">I pointed out you know you can monitor</font>

320
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,380
security cameras and see when they see

321
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:44,470
motion potentially you can you can have

322
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:47,050
movements of people you can also

323
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,900
determine you know which which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi art</font>

324
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:52,569
which Wi-Fi devices are associated with

325
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">any given access point because you can</font>

326
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,560
see they're talking to each other and

327
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,100
sending data packets and there's

328
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually another night admission you get</font>

329
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,910
there's like management packages control

330
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:06,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">tactics and data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so you can</font>

331
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:08,809
actually see it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sending data and</font>

332
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">I should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also point out that this</font>

333
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:12,889
tracking of people's movements um it was

334
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,839
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that came out so did</font>

335
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:18,319
but the government is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

336
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:20,119
this track people and it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

337
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,289
simple to do you know keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font>

338
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,270
sitting out any package you're on

339
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:26,599
connecting anything you're simply

340
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:31,250
constantly monitoring radio waves over

341
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:33,530
with you know head you they get um you

342
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,320
can also if you go into if you actually

343
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:38,840
send data in raulito 2011 you can do

344
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,789
other things like to do all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tasks</font>

345
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,309
and we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get into that in</font>

346
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:46,400
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one so anyway how do you how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

347
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:48,530
do these raw 80 shoot 11<font color="#E5E5E5"> capture it and</font>

348
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,929
monitor mode so i want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you this</font>

349
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:54,678
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux perspective using Holly</font>

350
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:57,289
um and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to show you the wrong</font>

351
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,669
commands so you know it's our nominees I

352
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:01,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing to see what's your wireless</font>

353
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:05,330
devices and you know let's say wlan0

354
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,610
we're trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use you can use the ilu</font>

355
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:11,658
deff command to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> its physical</font>

356
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:16,520
interface ID you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> then run IW this</font>

357
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:19,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">man here to add a basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to add a</font>

358
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:22,549
monitor device on that for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical</font>

359
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,770
device to leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> yolan and up the new one</font>

360
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:28,940
and then you have a wireless device

361
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:30,770
beacons and monitor mode on you can they

362
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:34,039
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do i fire</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and take again you'll</font>

363
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:37,309
see or monitor device and then something

364
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:40,400
to be aware of is again it's a radio

365
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:42,620
it's just a radio and radios can't

366
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,000
actually receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> at every frequency</font>

367
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,979
simultaneously and that's why there's

368
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,860
channels and when you're in raw mode

369
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,510
it's actually a responsibility to set a

370
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,899
channel to set the frequency of the

371
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:57,289
radio which is really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you</font>

372
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:59,630
can lie set it to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> designees</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> channels</font>

373
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:01,850
although theoretically drive your driver

374
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:05,870
but anyway so you said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's to the</font>

375
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:08,990
channel you can do IWC that it is indeed

376
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:11,719
the channel that I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> and from there</font>

377
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:13,820
you can catch your raw frames basically

378
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,910
using any key tap program so it can be

379
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:19,790
TCP dump it can be wider<font color="#E5E5E5"> shark I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

380
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:22,460
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> JP myself that it's a python library</font>

381
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:26,659
and it's two commands like you know

382
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:29,540
importance can be stuff and then just

383
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:32,030
uses unit normal sense and you get the

384
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:35,000
raw data frames just like that you can

385
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:37,790
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> analyze them grab out things like</font>

386
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,300
mac address that it's from<font color="#CCCCCC"> events</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

387
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:44,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's basically how you do it um</font>

388
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,428
now I'm kind of in this kind of part of

389
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">this talk but I actually developed a</font>

390
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:51,620
little tool to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help with this call</font>

391
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:54,678
tracker gender which you see it up

392
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:59,659
anyway I told<font color="#CCCCCC"> time for gender and it's a</font>

393
00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:03,020
Python program that's based on JP umm it

394
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:06,890
only runs on linux for now um to install

395
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:11,240
it it hit the tip install its Python 30

396
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:14,000
me um and it makes less you do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

397
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,250
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do which are</font>

398
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">these tracking and you know tracking</font>

399
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:22,520
things as well as some functionality to

400
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:26,270
map what it surrounds me you know what

401
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:29,870
what what what radio what devices are

402
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,190
sending radio waves that I can see and

403
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:35,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">how are they associated you know what</font>

404
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:37,070
what devices are on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> s IDs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we can</font>

405
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:39,470
do all of that with a malfunction ality

406
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,480
you can see an example command that like

407
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:46,040
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I used to track a mac address like</font>

408
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:50,780
this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40 on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the security camera</font>

409
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:55,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly um also um some running it</font>

410
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:58,730
looks like is um I am tracking all of

411
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:02,360
you right now if you have a wireless

412
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:04,900
device that is on I probably have your

413
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,899
mac address

414
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:11,309
as true and dispersing is actually a

415
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:13,230
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to voice but just show you</font>

416
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:16,889
how what he also does amount looks like

417
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:21,840
you know maybe just list a bunch of BS

418
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:24,330
SIDS and then the SSID that so scenes

419
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:28,259
with them and the various MAC addresses

420
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:33,418
that are associated hit on a channel

421
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:39,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">channel basis so you know channel 44</font>

422
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:41,399
channel 40 etc now<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you'd like to if</font>

423
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:42,899
you'd like me to leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> your mac address</font>

424
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:47,459
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me your name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

425
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:52,049
mac address I don't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the other</font>

426
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:59,190
um so anyway that that's kind of tracker

427
00:21:52,049 --> 00:22:02,609
jacker it's um go again it's on um it's

428
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:04,950
on hi hi so that's like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

429
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:06,449
install it and github code is publicly

430
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:11,159
available you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could probably just google</font>

431
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:13,739
for it um a couple notes on the

432
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:16,320
environment um so you notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

433
00:22:13,739 --> 00:22:18,509
pretty serious looking Wi-Fi adapter

434
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,918
here it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really ugly but the reason I</font>

435
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:23,399
have this one is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a dual</font>

436
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:26,279
band so I can capture it in both 2.4

437
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:29,668
gigahertz and fighting hurts most of the

438
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:32,669
channels most of the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've done has</font>

439
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:34,230
been in kali linux running on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PM and</font>

440
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:37,619
it works best if you run with an

441
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:39,509
external adapter a lot of internal

442
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:42,658
adapter especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> for using in the vm</font>

443
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:43,799
you can't put them in monitor mode so

444
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:46,019
that's a big reason and plus you

445
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:49,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually get much farther week with an</font>

446
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:52,019
external adapter all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them also as far</font>

447
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:55,649
as wireless devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tested a few um</font>

448
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:59,700
this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a nice point it's like</font>

449
00:22:55,649 --> 00:23:04,799
really keeping up their<font color="#CCCCCC"> King bucks on</font>

450
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:07,529
amazon um so this one looks over works

451
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:11,399
well i'll try to post<font color="#CCCCCC"> keynotes someone</font>

452
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:16,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">line outside 405 anti-trans website um</font>

453
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:18,178
this is a good one um<font color="#CCCCCC"> i tried another</font>

454
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:20,399
one by the tp-link that didn't work very

455
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:23,220
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's newer drivers are out there</font>

456
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,479
yet a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a lot of kiki</font>

457
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,509
links<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a lot especially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

458
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:33,539
alphas<font color="#CCCCCC"> were the Alpha brand or really</font>

459
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:38,789
well I have so anyway if you take aways

460
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:40,499
Wi-Fi<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just radio it's just a radio as</font>

461
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:42,570
a physical layer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really</font>

462
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:43,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting when you think about that</font>

463
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:48,418
and all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you could potentially</font>

464
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:51,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">do um it's trivial to track Wi-Fi</font>

465
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:55,259
devices in monitor mode um and

466
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">surprisingly interesting information can</font>

467
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:59,909
be obtained even though the packets are

468
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:04,019
encrypted looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking just at the</font>

469
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:06,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">the metadata</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I introduce new</font>

470
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:08,700
tool tracker jacker it's very much alpha

471
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,559
stage by the way but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm adding new</font>

472
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,809
functionality hopefully we'll get mad

473
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:18,059
and support if it's possible sometime

474
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:20,070
soon um and how to not be trapped if

475
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,600
you're traveling and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want the</font>

476
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,908
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> or some other organization</font>

477
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,539
track your movements it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably best</font>

478
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:31,440
to just turn off your Wi-Fi um some

479
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:34,080
devices actually I phones are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

480
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,409
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this um and when they are not</font>

481
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,970
attached<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a particular at this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

482
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:42,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">they actually randomize the mac address</font>

483
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:45,749
for you which helps to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tracked</font>

484
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:49,529
which is really great so you can use an

485
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:51,509
iphone or turn off your Wi-Fi um but

486
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:54,269
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind this doesn't mitigate</font>

487
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:56,610
distractibility completely because

488
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:58,619
ultimately when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you when you attach to a</font>

489
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:02,879
local network<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you've been part of</font>

490
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:08,100
um you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually uses your real</font>

491
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:09,509
mac address um and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

492
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,158
that's one thing is really interesting

493
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:13,080
to me about a lot of this wireless

494
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:16,350
security stuff compared to like binary

495
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:19,230
exploitation is that so you know if you

496
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:21,629
like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do find a bug and binary um</font>

497
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:23,170
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be useful but it's ultimately</font>

498
00:25:21,629 --> 00:25:26,139
bug that can be patched

499
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:28,030
nyr the security a lot of the

500
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:31,450
vulnerabilities didn't find our are

501
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:34,030
systemic and they are not easily touched

502
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:35,770
you know I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to I mean</font>

503
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:40,930
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing there's almost nothing</font>

504
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:46,180
no way to mitigate a lot of these attack

505
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:50,260
vectors so that's really interesting so

506
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:51,610
I thank you and I guess we have a few

507
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:56,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes so if anyone has any questions</font>

508
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:59,080
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if there's any wireless</font>

509
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,649
adapters but purpose radar detector

510
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:05,980
detector style listening see if anyone's

511
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:07,720
in monitor mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> um as far as I know when</font>

512
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,600
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> a monitor mode you simply don't</font>

513
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,510
give off an ERF so the entrance it's not

514
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:16,179
even physically possible for some kinds

515
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:19,180
of radio they radar detectors emit<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

516
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,830
signal that you can listen to so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

517
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:23,530
did if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> there might be someone with</font>

518
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:27,100
radio backscatter but you're getting

519
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:31,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">really esoteric is everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

520
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:36,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">another one any other questions up get</font>

521
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:40,330
the album<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

522
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:42,520
yeah I kind of different kids get in it

523
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:44,230
maybe is a few much more in version 2 it

524
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:48,040
would be lifted if you found any that

525
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:50,350
anymore said one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those chips yeah</font>

526
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,840
yeah so that if you make the one a

527
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:55,270
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> white one um basically the new</font>

528
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,560
version has a chipset it's also dual

529
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,210
band which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bought it because</font>

530
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,419
I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> sweet you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do two point four</font>

531
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:03,310
and five yrs it turn out to be obtained

532
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:07,630
I have any not working yet I just got a

533
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:09,340
two days hey hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey they didn't change</font>

534
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:13,390
the model number so it's not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

535
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:28,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">model of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is good okay any</font>

536
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:30,360
others yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically uh I right into</font>

537
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:32,399
the response software

538
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,459
I mean I very correlated unless we do

539
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:39,180
you want to go on here security camera

540
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,950
um it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun like I mean I don't</font>

541
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I'm a control freak but it's</font>

542
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,910
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> close to being able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> control</font>

543
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,250
stuff myself with computers in physical

544
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,660
world it's like magic it's like its cool

545
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,250
the right stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> approach in a</font>

546
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,500
computer and runs on the computer and

547
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,810
make this world but it's cool when you

548
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,380
get outside of the computer so that's

549
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,379
that NZ
