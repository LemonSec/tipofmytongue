1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,170
su-27s you 20 or so we're happy

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,210
including the remodeled the VNC model

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:13,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">concer Simpson and if you don't know</font>

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:16,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the C&D model of the su-24m swing</font>

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:20,160
wings and they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fixed wing version</font>

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:24,750
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the saloon version they had su-27s</font>

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:29,250
I'll see I said that big 30 words may 29

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:32,910
so they have this lottery and was flown

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:36,030
by American pilots American Air Force

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,760
pilots that were trained in this and so

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,710
when they when they were when they

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,040
scheduled the mission then they took off

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,829
somebody had to talk to him on their

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,440
frickin teeth they were going up to do a

15
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:53,100
functional flightcheck or they are going

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,890
up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a mission or whatever they</font>

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,590
talked to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that was one of my</font>

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,829
additional duties was controlling the

19
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:04,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">air force's mix water when it would take</font>

20
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:08,159
off now I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you where they went</font>

21
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:12,420
whoops barks lon<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell you where</font>

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,640
where they went but I and I can't tell

23
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">you where they came from I could just</font>

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,689
tell you that the reason we had this

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:24,869
squadron was at the time you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font>

26
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:28,110
looked at the Soviet<font color="#E5E5E5"> Union as a as a</font>

27
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:31,320
everything and non air breathing threat

28
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,990
and everything is bombers and on your

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,419
breathing is ballistic missiles so

30
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,630
you're you're talking about space threat

31
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:43,020
and also a air breathing or atmospheric

32
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:49,408
threat so we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet that threat</font>

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:50,970
somehow so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Air Force with the</font>

34
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:55,649
airport students that collect that all

35
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:58,679
these makes from different countries

36
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,899
around the Middle East and they

37
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,060
collected them all in what they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

38
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,250
they took them off and they flew what we

39
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,740
call it dissimilar aircraft combat

40
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:12,530
tactics we take off and they would mix

41
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:15,440
it up with American f-16s and f-18s

42
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,440
and activities and the reason why is

43
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,690
they wanted to get they<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

44
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,500
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Soviet aircraft on the radars</font>

45
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:27,859
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the Soviet aircraft have</font>

46
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:35,060
that we hope is that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very small</font>

47
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:42,500
compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ours and what what the</font>

48
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:47,239
reflecting value theory I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

49
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:50,780
stick I think it's a 180 for me anyway

50
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:54,230
the reflecting the reflective value is

51
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,450
called a radar cross-section and I knew

52
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,899
the values of all the all the aircraft

53
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:02,089
because that was my job so the radar

54
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,989
cross section tells you how reflective

55
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:08,630
and their crack is how reflective it

56
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:16,220
will be when you hit it<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the radar</font>

57
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:21,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">be um speaking of that my presentation</font>

58
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:25,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">is on radar assam present now you would</font>

59
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:31,609
think that radar would be a relatively

60
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:34,518
new thing to us well it's not who's ever

61
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,860
who's ever flown or not flown on an

62
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:40,730
airliner<font color="#E5E5E5"> look out the window and saw</font>

63
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:44,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">this antenna attorney that's right</font>

64
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:48,950
antenna tourney did you notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

65
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:51,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it that was different or did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

66
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,690
know same thing about her it was unique

67
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:59,690
or something that you wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask a</font>

68
00:03:53,690 --> 00:04:04,730
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the that type of antenna</font>

69
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:07,640
is called a air search radar and there's

70
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:09,920
a little bar on the top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if you see</font>

71
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,589
if you look at it there's a little bar

72
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,010
that's called an interrogator responder

73
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:19,668
now they use what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called a dsb</font>

74
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:21,950
somebody told me they can that with the

75
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:25,340
right equipment you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a DSP</font>

76
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:26,120
and so the you know it's relatively

77
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,590
simple tool

78
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:34,970
a DSP but<font color="#CCCCCC"> security wise may be</font>

79
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:42,859
relatively easy to to interfere with a

80
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:46,100
DSP and who has a cell phone who does I

81
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:50,630
never met<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wellman I offset for a</font>

82
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:52,639
reason okay well well I say let's say I

83
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:57,919
wanted you not to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to take calls</font>

84
00:04:52,639 --> 00:05:01,280
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put a what's called a noise</font>

85
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:04,609
jammer somewhere in this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

86
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:09,500
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to generate noise on the cell</font>

87
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:12,229
phone frequencies and when if I do that

88
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,900
in this room you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will not be able to</font>

89
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:18,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">make phone calls on yourselves and it</font>

90
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:21,440
does not matter what kind of cell you

91
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:26,479
have does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not matter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what brand and</font>

92
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:30,229
still jamming and this is one thing that

93
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:33,289
part of the thing that I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share</font>

94
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:42,349
with you the frequency spectrum that

95
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:46,669
that that cell phones are in Sea lies in

96
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:48,740
the microwave band now let's see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

97
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:52,159
microwave band takes up part of the

98
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:54,770
search radar bank now remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

99
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,270
radar I told you you would sometimes see

100
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:01,190
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the airplane window on the</font>

101
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:06,469
airport the search<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reiter that band is</font>

102
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:09,410
partially taken up by by microwaves and

103
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:13,130
the civilian designation is different

104
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:16,400
from the military so if I say I wanted

105
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:20,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jim I want to practice jamie feltham and</font>

106
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,710
that's that some

107
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:44,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">oban and up tango man up to x-ray</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

108
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:51,159
the eye on the charts online CD anyway

109
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:54,819
the those bands the military shams

110
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:57,669
regularly for practice<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I encountered</font>

111
00:06:54,819 --> 00:07:00,159
some of that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was taught electronic</font>

112
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:02,109
countermeasures and the electronic

113
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:04,869
counter counter metrics in other words

114
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:08,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">counter in the electronic game there's</font>

115
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:11,679
different kinds of jamming and the I

116
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:14,559
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> any frequency can be jammed</font>

117
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:17,948
if you know if you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what that</font>

118
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:19,389
frequency band is it can be jammed it

119
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:23,169
can be physically child or

120
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:28,479
electronically jammed and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes for</font>

121
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:30,758
all of your of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your media devices that</font>

122
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,989
goes for all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your media devices your</font>

123
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:41,079
cars did you know that the the auto

124
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:43,179
industry has has i want to say rented

125
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:46,689
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually that's not really a true</font>

126
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:50,318
word the auto industry has a specific

127
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:54,849
microwave band for the using automobiles

128
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:57,849
now you know when you send off up send

129
00:07:54,849 --> 00:08:00,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">up your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 15</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year old move with their</font>

130
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:04,779
learning permanent and they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a</font>

131
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:08,949
car and basically the car parks itself

132
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:13,149
you drive up to a truck that acts out in

133
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:15,999
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you car stops itself the car</font>

134
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:21,189
goes down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the street it keeps junior or</font>

135
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:24,999
this in her<font color="#CCCCCC"> lane or his laning so they</font>

136
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:27,459
don't drift<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up that's basically</font>

137
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:29,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's basically what they do now the</font>

138
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:33,039
driverless cars operate on the same

139
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:36,250
frequencies so if I know that frequency

140
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:39,909
band I can set up a jammer and jam that

141
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:42,940
babe so like

142
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:46,870
like the previous speaker said he caused

143
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:50,020
a white screen on wordpress for an

144
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:54,970
estimated<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a small or a specific</font>

145
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:59,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">period of time I put a janitor on your</font>

146
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:02,980
on that frequency for your car I could

147
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:06,040
Jam your car yeah I could Jam your cell

148
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:10,030
phone so so if you ran off the road you

149
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:13,959
can't call anybody I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jam your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> car's your</font>

150
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:18,339
car car sell own so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you couldn't call</font>

151
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:20,530
anybody from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> car this this is what</font>

152
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:23,860
I wanted to share with you because these

153
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:28,120
frequencies can be vulnerable vulnerable

154
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:33,880
microwave use of microwave frequencies

155
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:37,480
is not new back in the 90s the United

156
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,860
States was looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're in fact</font>

157
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're doing it right now they're</font>

158
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking for a new new and updated</font>

159
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:53,200
equipment for air<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic control you</font>

160
00:09:44,380 --> 00:10:02,320
know GPS GPS does the work except GPS

161
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:07,450
satellites are vulnerable to what e.m p

162
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:12,190
n ebuddy know what that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like a</font>

163
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:18,460
magnetic pulse<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now the problem is</font>

164
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:25,420
we look at gps<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's something that is</font>

165
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:27,520
relatively safe what I'm telling you is

166
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,800
when we look at all of our frequency

167
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,170
spectrum we have to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as</font>

168
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,560
something that we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> treat as</font>

169
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:38,110
something valuable to us not as

170
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,439
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take for granted how to</font>

171
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,260
treat our frequency<font color="#E5E5E5"> bands as if their</font>

172
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:49,360
goalie because that's what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are to</font>

173
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:51,470
us we paid on a week we have our friends

174
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">honor we train with them</font>

175
00:10:51,470 --> 00:11:01,220
so they're valued to us now as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

176
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:08,360
radars and sri microwave radar is

177
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:10,010
microwave radar is probably the best the

178
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,310
most type of radar you could use that

179
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:16,460
seed because it's running site now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

180
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:20,150
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they I am picture of a</font>

181
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:25,760
microwave tower when I lived in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Southern</font>

182
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:27,770
Nevada in the sandbox the<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a</font>

183
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:33,319
microwave tower down the street<font color="#CCCCCC"> from us</font>

184
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:35,900
and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looked like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a palm tree so if you</font>

185
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:41,810
and I remember seeing it and I'm looking

186
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:45,140
at it what is that to microwave<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tower</font>

187
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:47,900
you see the microwave repeaters on the

188
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,480
tower the microwave repeaters our line

189
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,900
of sight to the other towers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

190
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,890
microwave signal is his line of sight

191
00:11:53,900 --> 00:12:01,010
and it has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be boosted now they've</font>

192
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:04,280
right now industry has developed a way

193
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:08,330
to produce<font color="#CCCCCC"> more power in microwave</font>

194
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:10,550
systems so now we can see let's see<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

195
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:15,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">see I read any military intelligence</font>

196
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:17,599
magazine last month that there Raytheon

197
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:22,040
is developing a radar that can see

198
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:26,420
submarine periscopes if they're above

199
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:29,000
water that's cool if you can and there

200
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:32,870
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one thing that microwave microwaves</font>

201
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,710
do provide black face or a phased array

202
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:40,640
antennas provide very very detailed

203
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:43,220
return now what's neat about microwaves

204
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:46,430
is you can color you can color<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

205
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:50,720
return you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in two colors you</font>

206
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:52,880
can make it in two forms i can actually

207
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,640
you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your computer</font>

208
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:00,500
generate a form of what you're looking

209
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:03,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">at a microwave which is cool sorry about</font>

210
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:06,180
the presentation

211
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,150
that's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as I can go so go</font>

212
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:16,859
ahead sorry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that guys</font>

213
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:16,860
