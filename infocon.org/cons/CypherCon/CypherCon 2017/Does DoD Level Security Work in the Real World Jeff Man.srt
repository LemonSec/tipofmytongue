my career could read it there that

167
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:25,449
basically I got in trouble with security

168
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,979
if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> came in one morning I opened up the</font>

00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:30,729
inside the safe things these come to the

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:38,450
the safecracking guys last night

174
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that was similar to the</font>

175
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,130
one that I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> although we zoom in it</font>

176
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,600
was a much newer lot but in the old days

177
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,700
it was like some of the ones that he

178
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,490
added out there where if you don't spend

179
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,340
the tumblers enough you can slide it

180
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:55,670
back and it really have him set guilty

181
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,620
but I was young educated as a college

182
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,930
I'm like what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big deal you know</font>

183
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,630
I'm working<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a facility that's got a</font>

184
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:06,890
fence around it perimeter protection

185
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:09,560
it's got a gate<font color="#E5E5E5"> entrance of the building</font>

186
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:12,380
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get past</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the jury in some</font>

187
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:16,819
sort of a checkpoint the door the office

188
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:19,280
had a lock on it and then and even him

189
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,410
and the security guards obviously would

190
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,270
walk the halls at night so what's the

191
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">big deal so I love the safe open it</font>

192
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:28,040
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole going secure and what's</font>

193
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:31,100
the risk the pump and bad happen so

194
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,599
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll come back to that</font>

195
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:36,200
later but that was sort of my first

196
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,270
lesson and security was guilty I got

197
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,600
reprimanded I think I did it twice and

198

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:52,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">the second</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time I learned the lesson so</font>

201
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:55,430
in trying to answer this question to Zod

206
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:09,650
real quickly briefly the real world me I

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,050
consulting career they sort of had this

215
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:29,420
attitude and perception that<font color="#E5E5E5"> DMV level</font>

216
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:32,719
security was all for expensive ultra

complicated very very cumbersome and

218
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,690
basically it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was as n degrees extra</font>

on op SEC is what we it's just

00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,740
behaviors so on and so which one of

discipline each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had offices and</font>

00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:40,580
people that specialize in the specific

242
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:43,880
thing so there's a lot to it there's

243
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:47,360
many elements to it but it all boils

244
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,370
down to mobile uses of all the risk

245
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,690
equation and there's many worse

246
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:56,690
operations out there if you google it

247
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,310
you'll find<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sorts of the very</font>

248
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:01,490
complicated algorithms I'm not a

mathematician Plato wrong to be because

250
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,290
I'm Accord analyst but it all boils down

251
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,480
to its very basic elements when I try to

252
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,849
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's all about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> risk</font>

253
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,620
and the risk is the risk of something

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,440
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't want to have</font>

255
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,930
happen and the likelihood<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happens</font>

256
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,360
at its most basic level is some

257
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:24,500
combination of the vulnerabilities that

258
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:27,080
exists within your system in<font color="#CCCCCC"> addition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something bad to you or at</font>

00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:38,000
call countermeasures and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are hosts</font>

263
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,410
basically defined like this and if you

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,690
have a good on the industry conference

265

talking to a marketing person how they

all costs security is just something you

do because the risk is the loss of human

security is also basically focused

catch the internet the internet was

think we were talking about encryption

397
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,559
my favorite topic and I was explaining

398

what the options were or protecting data

399
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,279
it rests the encryption is one of the

options<font color="#E5E5E5"> as other things that you can do</font>

walking from explaining it all smells

404

without this kind of wish it easy to

again but we don't need deity level

408
00:18:24,149 --> 00:18:29,998
especially stuck with me the last couple

577

days but historically and possibly a lot

580
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:17,119
of it has to do with data and

581
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:19,580

00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,309
countermeasures is a whole industry is

608
00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:21,259
growing up about producing

609
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:23,450
countermeasures but what's different

610
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:25,970
about the risk model in the commercial

611
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:28,700
world and this might be an unsolvable

612
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:32,809
problem is risk in the commercial world

613
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:34,849
is largely a dollar figure whereas the

614
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:37,668
government which recall is that it's

615
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:39,979
human life but in the commercial world

616
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:42,049
these are companies are<font color="#CCCCCC"> sovereign</font>

threats apply different countermeasures

622
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:57,559
they all come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cost and they have to</font>

if they're too

625
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:02,200
if somebody is presenting a risk model

626
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:06,580
to them they're making a financial

627
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:09,789
decisions in today and something they

628

don't do necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a sign of</font>

630
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:15,820
protect and this is a key area that I

631
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:18,850
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we can learn</font>

data classification that's kind of what

636
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,570
I'm talking about but as an example you

637
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,279
probably all seen movies and you're

638

639
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,450
super top secret there's different

640
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:39,129
levels of data classification and we

641
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,619
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have that in industry in</font>

642
00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:44,469
commercial world with its usually public

00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:47,470
and private or public and proprietary or

644
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:49,119

<font color="#E5E5E5">of difference usually there's nothing</font>

647
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:58,299
the big thing that's missing in terms of

648
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:59,980
data classification is I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see very</font>

649
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:03,759
often in the commercial world at any

sense of valuing the data or giving any

problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the life expectancy the data</font>

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know Vietnam movie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Korea whatever</font>

655
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:21,668
and you've got troops on the ground or

656
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:23,469
in the middle of a firefight and they're

657
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:26,289
calling in air support for an airstrike

658
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:29,230
to take out the machine gun as the enemy

<font color="#E5E5E5">they're calling it coordinates and they</font>

662
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:38,889
coordinates that's data and that's

663
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:42,669
extremely important data to protect for

664
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:45,309
maybe a half hour maybe an hour because

665
00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:46,299
once the airstrikes been called in it

666
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:47,859
doesn't really matter what the

667
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:51,369
coordinates were so there's a life

certain current events on whole

reason it's top secret is not the data

679
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:21,680
itself it's how we got the data so what

00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:55,310
your corporate<font color="#CCCCCC"> networks there's better</font>

715
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:57,470
data and there's less good data is the

716
00:31:55,310 --> 00:32:00,200
boldest steal data of the goal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

717
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:02,630
abscess all to the data make today

718
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,460
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not available because we know</font>

719
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:07,640
how easy it is rated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the networks</font>

720
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:10,820
as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get anywhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the network</font>

721
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:12,890
more than likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> pitit get wherever you</font>

722
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">want be in the network and in the early</font>

723
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,430
days it didn't matter as much because

724
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,190
people just break into that works just

725
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:20,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today I did that</font>

726
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:22,029
check it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out nowadays people who figured</font>

727
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,769
out a<font color="#E5E5E5"> garage that figured out how to</font>

728
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:25,299
monetize data so they're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

729
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:26,710
data they're looking for ways to get the

730
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:29,080
data out more efficiently<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more</font>

731
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:34,120
cost-effectively they've got risk model

732
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:44,470
too so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next element of govt security</font>

733
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:47,018
that sort of plays into this area we

734
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:49,690
probably heard variations<font color="#CCCCCC"> just what we</font>

735
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:51,879
used to call security<font color="#CCCCCC"> and death this is</font>

an aerial photograph of the city at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

740
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:08,200
there's layers there and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can imagine</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the king or the river the leader</font>

742

was of this city was probably in the

743
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:16,479
innermost part they were being<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacked</font>

744
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:18,490
and the further out you go less

745
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,860
important people were there fighting off

746
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bad guys and it's combination of</font>

747
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:25,479
modes and walls and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

748
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:27,580
layered protection probably altered

749
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,870
variations of that a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

750
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,870
about how this is the only way

751
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:34,479
especially in today's cloud-connected

752
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:36,668
world or infrastructures now out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

753
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,399
somewhere instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the classic sense</font>

754
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:41,529
of perimeter but the concept is<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

755
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:44,439
applies especially to figure how what's

756
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:47,139
more important less important network<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

757
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:51,309
think still applies and we would call it

758
00:33:47,139 --> 00:33:54,428
segmentations in graffiti I world

759
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:56,408
separating things out and I read an

760
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:58,000
article<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently that was talking about</font>

761
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,620
this a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's and what's</font>

762
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,269
great about the fact that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> classic</font>

763
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:04,000
version of this is to try to slow down

764
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:07,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">the adversary well that's a significant</font>

765
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,300
point we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to design systems where I</font>

766
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:13,780
used to work with this in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

767
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:16,990
another factor how good the security was

768
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:20,889
was make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it more costly and expensive</font>

769
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:23,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">and time-consuming then the value of the</font>

770
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:26,320
data was worth the adversary trying to

771
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,720
go after obviously and we were

772
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">nation-states</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was our adversary</font>

773
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,469
and we would base our calculations based

774
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:33,969
on what we used to call the gross

775
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:36,549
national product was you know how to

776
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:38,139
propose domestic product basically how

777
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:40,240
much money does that company<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

778
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:42,580
country have and how much are they

779
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,739
willing to invest in trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

780
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:47,739
bit of information given all these

781
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:50,109
layers of protection so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have</font>

782
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:52,629
to be perfect security forever it has to

783
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:58,360
be long enough to make it nod with it a

784
00:34:52,630 --> 00:35:00,490
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next element is I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

785
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:03,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably the most important one and one</font>

786
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:07,270
of them however the scope of you and

787
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:09,700
that is building into companies a

788
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:12,759
culturist jury what I call a cultural

789
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:15,160
security where I used to work in the DoD

790
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,790
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mission of the deity was security</font>

791
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,350
and that was what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you did and it was it</font>

792
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:22,690
was part of the fabric it was part of

793
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:25,089
the culture and everybody knew so think

794
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:27,880
back to my earlier story of a lot of

795
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:29,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who walked in to recap real quick</font>

796
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,210
my first job was a summer job as a

797
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,850
summer intern and enabled research

798
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:36,610
facility and I was going to classified

799
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:38,589
material in a cabinet and island cabinet

800
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:40,390
and I left it unlocked one night and I

801
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:43,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">got in trouble so I learned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lesson</font>

802
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:47,830
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> lesson was there was a lot of other</font>

803
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:50,980
protections in place and why what I

804
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:53,740
learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> also was where the result ease</font>

805
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:55,540
with other layers of protection where I

806
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:58,959
thought what was the big deal is one

807
00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:01,750
thing failed a lesson I learned is the

808
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,640
culture was there was a fence around the

809
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,230
building it was a perimeter fence and it

810
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,779
was hundreds of yards away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

811
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:09,670
building and had barbed<font color="#CCCCCC"> wire on it may</font>

812
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:11,590
or may not have had<font color="#E5E5E5"> motion sensors line</font>

813
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:13,810
it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> or may not have had cameras on</font>

814
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:17,590
there are a lot of components and parts

815
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:20,049
and processes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one piece and then</font>

816
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:21,850
going inside the building and having to

817
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:24,250
get through past the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front desk taps</font>

818
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:27,160
returns miles past the security guard we

819
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:28,630
had badges actually they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were initially</font>

820
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were picture badges and</font>

821
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:32,590
approximately<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine there were slight</font>

822
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:36,550
badges but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is layers of security</font>

823
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:38,560
with processes go around and locking

824
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:41,440
doors isolating things to different

825
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,180
areas and not everybody you have to go

826
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,770
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> every office that's where that good</font>

827
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,529
security in depth that segmentation

828
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:52,360
comes up changing the foundation not

829
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:55,150
displaying it not right in on the wall

830
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,830
beside keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> it secret and even here</font>

831
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,240
the security guards it was interesting

the security guards<font color="#E5E5E5"> at most of the</font>

innocuous rules for all our details and

everybody understood that it all work

846

together to create this environment and

believed in it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at it anyone</font>

was trained on it everybody is aware of

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and took it seriously it wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead</font>

it all started with that look up at the

it was all the details you ever want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

agreed it was not achievable it wasn't

really useful that's what the government

free and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fits in with what</font>

1060
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:49,540
I'm saying about we need to lead to

1061
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:51,970
spread the knowledge in the learning

1062
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:54,849
will get it out there so again questions

1063
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:56,589
and comments no idea how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much time with</font>

1064
00:46:54,849 --> 00:46:59,740
up but there's not an ambulance until I

1065
00:46:56,589 --> 00:47:02,080
yeah a 10 minutes one vehicle 10 minutes

1066
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:04,959
any questions comments disagreements

1067
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:07,029
that's it I just checked<font color="#E5E5E5"> the title</font>

1068
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,800
because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure i didn't</font>

1069
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:13,900
miss understand but

1070
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:16,030
was does it work and I guess I maybe

1071
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:20,290
just playing words you know and it

1072
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:22,210
needed yes does it work I'm on the fence

1073
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:24,040
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> various reasons because people you</font>

1074
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:25,870
detailed a lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know people</font>

1075
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,720
say too expensive we don't need that

1076
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:29,950
yeah that's that's where I you know have

1077
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,819
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble and answering that question</font>

1078
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:37,270
place it's a comment list yeah more time

1079
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:39,070
unless a question oh yeah yeah I'm

1080
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:40,540
assuming this to be a discussion starter

1081
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:42,220
I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

1082
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:44,350
different what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been doing the last</font>

1083
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:47,589
25 years while it makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the difference</font>

1084
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:49,720
technology's advancing technologies come

1085
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:51,700
out it might call one problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1086
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:55,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">generally introduced to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agreements and</font>

1087
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:57,609
if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it vulnerabilities</font>

1088
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:02,589
the way we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of those attackers and</font>

1089
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:07,240
pen testers are really features chillin

1090
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:09,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">outland or i could say hackers i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asked</font>

1091
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,930
me to define<font color="#CCCCCC"> what a hacker was couple</font>

1092
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:12,820
months ago well basically somebody

1093
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:17,049
notice how your technology works better

1094
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:20,260
believe it and yet we continue to roll

1095
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:21,610
it out and and companies legitimately

1096
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:23,830
have because of legitimate need for

1097
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:26,110
companies I think they're justified

1098
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:28,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">insane I don't use some obscure I</font>

1099
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:36,250
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to know all this stuff</font>

1100
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:38,620
but yes so the purpose of on technology

1101
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:40,600
we built over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 19 pocket</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font>

1102
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:43,270
purpose of it not to be secure the

1103
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,490
perfect routine<font color="#CCCCCC"> at she's some result</font>

1104
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:48,490
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I don't know what is the</font>

1105
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:50,830
purpose of all the time o Muslims I know

1106
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:53,049
if you're building now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't build it</font>

1107
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:57,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">too what is the purpose of Pokemon go</font>

1108
00:48:53,050 --> 00:49:01,180
right buddy in the military get off my

1109
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:03,459
lawn I'm sorry good in the military to

1110
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:07,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">effect some you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> damage or in the</font>

1111
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:10,030
commercial space you know tesla car pick

1112
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:11,800
the technology ahead well some purposes

1113
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:14,860
a lot of it right who that time period

1114
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:18,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'd say on the whole why don't disagree</font>

1115
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:20,900
that info SEC has basically repeated the

1116
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:23,480
same problems I day the success of

1117

1127
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:54,529
you've got you know advancing

1128
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:57,410
technologies but they do one thing very

1129
00:49:54,530 --> 00:50:00,230
very differently which is their networks

1130
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:02,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">are not connected to other countries and</font>

have a weapon well maybe the guided

00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:18,500
bombs are now an hour talking amazon now

1134

1151
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:01,880
security of the protocol and I think

1152
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:05,480
ultimately you're going to have the

1153
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:08,510
commercial space embrace more layering

1154

there's let me down side skirt / hackers

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the corporate space you can</font>

1162
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:34,040
what you expressed initially in terms of

1163
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:36,170
great successes is could be defined as

1164
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:38,509
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off the technology and</font>

1166
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:47,600
and that is outweighed the losses it's

1167
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:50,390
another way of looking right and so your
