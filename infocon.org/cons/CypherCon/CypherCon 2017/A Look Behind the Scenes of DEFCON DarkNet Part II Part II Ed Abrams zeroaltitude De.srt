00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,860
right here today on dart at Neversoft

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,630
yeah well all right then I guess we're

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing a little bit of eternal darkness I</font>

have a general in the middle ready sorry

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:26,670
okay I so<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to I'm command</font>

you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> through a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of history</font>

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,319
ciphers today yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> we gave a talk</font>

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,510
on how to run how we go about running

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,920

audience participation on solving some

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,840
of these so throughout history<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice battle between code makers</font>

spymaster for England at the time and

58
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,130
was able to decrypt their message and

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,630
write them back to her while she<font color="#CCCCCC"> was on</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a year later she was beheaded this is</font>

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,500
cracked by doing a simple frequency

wrote a Goldberg shaker and put it out

there this fueled a whole bunch of you

play for a magnificant oddly the same

year that Queen Mario's was put on trial

<font color="#CCCCCC">um</font>

85
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:33,040
stood for about 300 years I was cracked

in court by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charles bench the strength</font>

different one time had essentially it'll

89
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:44,290
look up so if you both had the same one

90
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:49,690
time head and you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> keyword was</font>

91
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:51,970
to be here<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the messages hail this is</font>

92
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,160
what one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you can have any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

93
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,620
but this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most common used block</font>

94
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,050
so any one of 20 take them both

95
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,970
directions and you basically use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

96
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,460
keyword to look up the letters<font color="#CCCCCC"> of each</font>

97
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,510
the letters would end right<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand side in</font>

98
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,520
the letter that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to sell</font>

99
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:17,500
out across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top you look up a letter</font>

100
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:20,440
and open the cute Anjali so with that a

101
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,110
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of history there's actually a</font>

102
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:26,020
reason for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as well if you if you</font>

103
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,300
want to old scroll backward or forward

104
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,250
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exec later there's some</font>

105
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,930
hints there and so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing so what</font>

106
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,450
I'm going to do now is actually present

107
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:38,020
to you a cipher that we developed for

108
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:41,620
the darkness<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year and invite you to</font>

109
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">solve it and again this can be</font>

110
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,920
interacted so we're going to try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

111
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,050
through the presentation part as quickly

112
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,520
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible but then you know if you'd</font>

113
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">like we could could be just work through</font>

114
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,609
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things so so this hyper</font>

115
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:56,380
was part of a business card desi which

116
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,270
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the business card end</font>

117
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,750
and the critical bit are the gold

118
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:04,690
numbers here so it's worth pondering

119
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:09,610
what that sequence of numbers might be

120
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:12,280
I'll just leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up for a second here</font>

121
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,890
like I said we can go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it later</font>

122
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,900
as well I mean I'm happy again if we

123
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">decide that it's difficult</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

124
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the format of a 30-minute interactive</font>

125
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,270
day we can just walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> through it and I</font>

126
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,010
can walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> you through how wet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just for</font>

127
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:27,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">funsies because i think it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

128
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:29,920
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> ciphers get developed as well here</font>

129
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,950
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual cipher that the gold</font>

130
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,920
numbering is meant to solve now these

131
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:38,420
are sequins of clocks clocks are pretty

132
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,300
cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like</font>

133
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:46,370
what's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a clock a clock</font>

134
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:48,830
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a indicate the 12-hour clock 12 full</font>

135
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:52,460
hours of seconds which as you all know

136
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:59,900
is forty-three thousand two hundred

137
00:06:52,460 --> 00:07:02,090
seconds very<font color="#E5E5E5"> relevant to this cipher and</font>

138
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,919
I'm realizing the limitations of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

139
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:07,039
form when it comes to interactively

140
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,360
follow me this so let me pop forward and

141
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we'll go back and walk you through</font>

142
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,100
this up so we can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how this</font>

143
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">was designed why we came up with is</font>

144
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:19,070
decided yha part it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to come</font>

145
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:21,349
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a cipher that's almost</font>

146
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:24,409
impossible to crack in a short amount of

147
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:26,090
time right the interesting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun part</font>

148
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,180
of it is come up with a cipher that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

149
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:32,239
solvable but it's hard to solve easy

150
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tigers are easy really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> impossible</font>

151
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:40,370
ciphers are pretty easy ciphers that are

152
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:43,370
solvable and fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> is hard now relevant to</font>

153
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:47,270
the clock puzzle is base arithmetic

154
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:49,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">patriotic is interesting and I think a</font>

155
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,430
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people take it for granted so</font>

156
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,670
we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just walk through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how numbers kind</font>

157
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:57,710
of work because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of cool when</font>

158
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:00,920
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sequence of digits in this</font>

159
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,840
case these are binary digits the way it

160
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:07,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">works is that each progressive place is</font>

161
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:09,830
a place of the base number to the next

162
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,440
power right these up and it pays to the

163
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero power is the ones place to the</font>

164
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,730
first power to the twos place to the

165
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,690
second power to fourth place and so on

166
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so forth and that's how binary</font>

167
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,370
numbers work there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some of the</font>

168
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:25,670
multiplication of the number in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

169
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:30,560
place times the places there in just

170
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:33,620
like the tens phase 10 numbers are again

171
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,350
a sequence of 10 to the power 0 1 2 3<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4</font>

172
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:39,560

173
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:41,300
thousands place so to get the number out

174
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,699
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the base system that you have you</font>

175
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:46,010
multiply the number in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the base position</font>

176
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">time to space and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you add them all</font>

177
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:52,100
together to get the numbers now basis

178
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:56,329
can be pretty tricky actually

179
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,949
like without negative basis how did

180
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:59,599
those work while they want the exact

181
00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:02,540
same way and they're only tricky because

182
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,069
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mind-bending to think of</font>

183
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,620
how this works but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

184
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:10,130
was negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 to the power 0 still in</font>

185
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,959
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> place then the next place is what</font>

186
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:15,230
they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the power</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one which will</font>

187
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:17,388
<font color="#E5E5E5">be the negative forest place so in this</font>

188
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,370
numbering system there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> no numbers</font>

189
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:21,440
designated with a negative time because

190
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,240
the numbering system itself covers all

191
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,779
of the negative and positive numbers in

192
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,579
one positive looking sequence which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

193
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:30,380
pretty interesting and potentially

194
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:35,120
useful for a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different kinds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

195
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:37,160
calculations so again if you were to

196
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:43,100
solve these<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to be another piece of</font>

197
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:44,630
the puzzle but let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> again if you going</font>

198
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,370
through this and then let's go back and

199
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:50,899
interactively solve the whole thing so

200
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:54,529
so this talk ends with this interesting

201
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:58,519
piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ciphertext which all of the</font>

202
00:09:54,529 --> 00:10:02,060
clues that we've divided up till now on

203
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:04,610
how so hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we'll just walk through</font>

204
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:08,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">the actual so cool so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

205
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:14,149
little ways here um talk about this

206
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:16,430
first I / this cipher that<font color="#CCCCCC"> gold</font>

207
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:20,240
lettering or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbering is a sequence</font>

208
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:26,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">of numbers that should be familiar 2 3 5</font>

209
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:40,100
7<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 13 17 19 23 29 those are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

210
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:42,258
26 not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> 70 G is 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 times</font>

211
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,610
that's correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> at first and if you</font>

212
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:45,589
counted about you discover that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

213
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:49,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">were 26 which is a pretty interesting</font>

214
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:51,410
puzzle piece because 26 a special number

215
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,350
does it's the number of letters that

216
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've got so that's kind of cool so that</font>

217
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">tells you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something about what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

218
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:03,270
numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are supposed to meet these clock</font>

219
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:06,210
faces then reminding me up

220
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:08,310
remind me because I'm weird I think of

221
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,780
myself ok cool so about a bunch of prime

222
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,689
numbers what I know about prime numbers

223
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:16,650
they have unique decomposition into a

224
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:21,540
series of numeric basis when you do

225
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:23,790
prime factorization of them and so

226
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,550
immediately<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my mind comes the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

227
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">how can I really compactly represent</font>

228
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,060
really huge numbers like multiply all

229
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,760
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> prime together that I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

230
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,050
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell something out and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will come</font>

231
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to mind first when you think about</font>

232
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,790
compact number of sedation well of

233
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:41,700
course clocks clocks come to mind

234
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,400
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can represent a base</font>

235
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,650
forty-three thousand two hundred number

236
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,260
I just using a sequence of clocks rather

237
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:51,150
than writing really giant decimal

238
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:57,660
numbers everywhere so I made a bunch of

239
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:59,189
clocks simple so now there's also

240
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions in who here knows what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

241
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:04,290
endian numbers are<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus little endian</font>

242
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:06,600
numbers can somebody give a description

243
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">a big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> endian means you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not on the</font>

244
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,980
left side it takes for a little bit

245
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:15,870
looks like doing the whole globe you

246
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:18,750
shins exactly so to repeat this for the

247
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:22,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">hydrophone big-endian</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers have their</font>

00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:42,870
hundred numbers what happens here is

254
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:45,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">there the sequence of words and near</font>

255
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:48,690
tell the words of forms each word takes

the letter that is in the word it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in</font>

257
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:54,270
the first place it as a W in the first

258
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:57,000
place i go and i find the WXYZ the 23rd

259
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:59,160
Prime and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i put it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the prime factors</font>

261
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,860
find the second letter<font color="#E5E5E5"> h which is the</font>

262
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,500
eighth letter of the alphabet and so I

263
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,320
put the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8th prime number in twice</font>

264
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,880
represent<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the second digit and so</font>

265
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,580
on for subsequent<font color="#E5E5E5"> digits so for each</font>

266
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,250
plays of the digit I put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that many more</font>

267
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,780
of the ordinal<font color="#E5E5E5"> prime</font>

268
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,100
represented by that number i multiply

269
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,709
them all together i get ridiculously

270
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,510
large numbers and so then i write them

271
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:28,080
in base forty-three thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> two hundred</font>

272
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:31,500
and use the relevant number and make a

273
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:36,570
clock out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it of course why would</font>

274
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:43,770
anybody do anything else am i right um

275
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:58,860
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually so it turns out the dis</font>

have been a very simple message which

282
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,140
would look like an encrypted sequence of

characters very small one though<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

284
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,670
it's very simple it's wrote 13 the

285
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,740
Caesar cipher which we were talking

286
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">about earlier is a slide deck and that's</font>

287
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,560
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection back to the story</font>

288
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,900
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> gives to happen guessing that it's</font>

289
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:48,930
row 13 immediately gives you English

290
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:51,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">English words that they his killer now</font>

291
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:53,819
his is not bound to anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet except</font>

292
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:56,189
the fact that is a caesar cipher we were

293
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:00,390
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the trees of Caesar as you</font>

294
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:08,040
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess that the answer is Curtis we</font>

295
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:12,330
did answer so good<font color="#E5E5E5"> job</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh awesome</font>

296
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:16,500
allegedly there you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected to the</font>

297
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:21,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet oh that you're home Michael I</font>

298
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:27,200
don't know it a little it's a little to

299
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,199
eat figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll refresh oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it may better</font>

300
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:41,630
well mixed success oh it's connecting

301
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:52,579
I'm sure that's the payoff<font color="#CCCCCC"> is imminent</font>

302
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:55,880
maybe you should read not a window

303
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,440
rebooting which would also<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve the</font>

304
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,600
problem but in a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> way because</font>

305
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,450
it would never come back home video

306
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:13,130
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let's go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

307
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:14,930
presentation somehow<font color="#CCCCCC"> more more beer</font>

308
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,420
would solve the problem so so cool now

309
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,489
we have a clue the clue is Brutus we got

310
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,560
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> by solving the puzzle which of</font>

311
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:24,230
course when they've taken you guys any

312
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,109
amount of time and and then we found the

313
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,730
row 13 which is caleb is killer Brutus

314
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:33,050
we're awesome work we're in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

315
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:34,850
square in good shape now um now we now

316
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:38,689
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the puzzle pieces that we need</font>

317
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,700
in order to solve the very last piece of

318
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,950
the puzzle here but let's imagine

319
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:52,010
especially would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back to is</font>

320
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:57,830
the so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

321
00:16:52,010 --> 00:17:00,050
complicated yeah present<font color="#CCCCCC"> there you go</font>

322
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay cool awesome this is this is</font>

323
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,800
sorting it so so now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the base</font>

324
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:08,060
numbers that turns out that there's

325
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:10,520
another puzzle right here this puzzle

326
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,909
again is top we're giving the tools that

327
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've been already taught here in the in</font>

328
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:22,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">the in the slide deck turned out that</font>

329
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:24,980
the number is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1015 1586 hop up here and</font>

330
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,900
and since you all have identical

331
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,510
memories<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure you remember that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

332
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:33,470
was the date mentioned previously on

333
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:35,960
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 in which the day to that Mary</font>

334
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:39,230
Queen of Scots was accused of treason

335
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,150
was tried for treason occurred and this

336
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,320
reminds<font color="#E5E5E5"> us of that part of the story so</font>

337
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:47,149
that's pretty cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> too right</font>

338
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:51,830
now we have Brutus a treasonous member

339
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:53,689
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Caesars court and the date of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

340
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:57,559
trial for<font color="#CCCCCC"> treason of Mary Queen of Scots</font>

341
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:59,029
and we ask ourselves what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what is one</font>

342
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:00,230
of these guys trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us well</font>

343
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:04,610
they may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to tell us that</font>

344
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:06,649
treason is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be something</font>

345
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:10,428
relevant to solving the puzzle which oh

346
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:14,389
my gosh that's exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> right you guys</font>

347
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:19,879
are doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing now this I / here</font>

348
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:22,729
which is now secured by 12<font color="#CCCCCC"> point that's</font>

349
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:25,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">hot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that puddle here is a different type</font>

350
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,929
or than the one that we were talking

351
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,730
before and if you were to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

352
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:30,889
bit of like cursory analysis of if you

353
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,950
might realize immediately that it's not

354
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:37,610
row 13 is number of 14 it's none of

355
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:39,980
those but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again did your clever and</font>

356
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:42,439
paying attention you realize that we've

357
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:47,570
mentioned one other historically

358
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:52,159
relevant and super interesting cipher in

359
00:18:47,570 --> 00:19:00,590
this presentation which is the veneer or

360
00:18:52,159 --> 00:19:03,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">visionnaire and oh yeah so putting these</font>

361
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,779
things together you you come to the

362
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:09,470
conclusion of course that treason is the

363
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:12,049
key that tells you which rose to use in

364
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:14,299
which order in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Visionaire and you</font>

365
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:16,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">then plugged it in and you get sick</font>

366
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:27,799
Semper Tyrannis which is a famous

367
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:30,379
quotation said bye sorry no closed or 10

368
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:32,418
not in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said by</font>

369
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:35,539
john wilkes booth upon the assassination

370
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:42,799
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Abraham Lincoln famous treasonous act</font>

371
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:44,389
and then doesn't have you got it good

372
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,429
anyway if you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this kind of</font>

373
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:48,649
thing this is what deck on is so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

374
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:53,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">common sense or what darknet is anyway</font>

375
00:19:48,649 --> 00:19:55,429
so I cars com every<font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Def Con every</font>

376
00:19:53,750 --> 00:20:00,200
year we have

377
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:02,000
27 to 30 semi quest lines at least a

378
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,700
dozen<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them probably this type of</font>

379
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,200
pattern other ones follow learn to

380
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,020
slaughter kid so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> milk and make a</font>

381
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,730
badge every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> year should actually</font>

382
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:24,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're looking show you guys ensuring the</font>

383
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:30,410
edges<font color="#E5E5E5"> subtle what so the bags look we</font>

384
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:34,430
did relax for years now so far right and

385
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:38,840
correct and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> year will be I will</font>

386
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:40,400
significantly hop all of those given the

387
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:44,240
amount of effort we put into it<font color="#CCCCCC"> less</font>

388
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">heart but there's quest on the badges so</font>

389
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,360
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually learning to slaughter</font>

390
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,040
what you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> solder all the badges</font>

391
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,740
have a unique ID it is usually some sort

392
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,899
of question if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need a out some of</font>

395
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:04,550
e keyboard probably should never do that

396
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:07,850
by the way he<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it at home then a</font>

great lasagna<font color="#CCCCCC"> at you had a clone each</font>

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:37,580
time you complete when you get points

408

into the last three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years we've been</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">rewarded the black guys if you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

410
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,880
isn't that fun I me to get free internet

411
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,370
comfort life and usually interview with

412
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Eunice a right afterwards that's how</font>

413
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:50,750
pros and cons of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> once you guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

414
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:58,070
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tech I'll throw this</font>

415
00:21:50,750 --> 00:22:03,560
image up there that's the link<font color="#CCCCCC"> the deck</font>

416
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:06,409
because once it take pics is almost the

417
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:12,290
time what question you get that

418
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:17,090
hello questions communicate perfectly I

419
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:19,490
reckon I don't know this question to

420
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:22,939
that I would have 22 and I got those of

421
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:25,670
this generation of hatch first the way I

422
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,560
exactly there's nice yeah I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks</font>

423
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,420
firmer for that one I like more I like

424
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,190
the dark net was actually my favorite

425
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,080
part of the comment like that better

426
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,250
than most of the list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concert I'm</font>

427
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,720
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being back there this</font>

428
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,090
year too nigga I hope you guys really

429
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,300
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out some insight for our</font>

430
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:43,070
90-day information but leave some detail

431
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,810
that would like if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a hack ties</font>

432
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:48,169
website we were interviewed last year

00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:51,590
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero and I for about 15-20 minutes</font>

434
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:54,530
on the history of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that dark net while</font>

435
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:57,320
you get that sort of thing there we are

436
00:22:54,530 --> 00:23:03,320
by far the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second-largest like by like</font>

5x the next comic minus we also a dt

438
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,689
Dark Continent we have our site online

439
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:11,000
now and about a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the con we</font>

440
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:13,730
put up a mini challenge there which is

441
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">very puzzled Lee it's completely online</font>

442
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:19,490
so we walk you through a sort of a micro

443
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,129
experience of what the darkness like in

444
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:25,190
them I love anybody wants to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

445
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:27,590
try it I happen to really love trying to

446
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,240
develop hard with all those diapers and

447
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,060
so I like talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that I like</font>

448
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:38,090
anybody wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come in and see these</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">he thought about with your son of it</font>

00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:19,680
what we spend between the months of

about end of april to august

466
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,540
we send spend more time together than we

467
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:29,280
really want to it's a reasonable

468
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:30,960
statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question sister I really</font>

469
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,990
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just had hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all</font>

00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">result considering we came up with four</font>

in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last 24 hours because we forgot</font>

476
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:56,280
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I got here um that's a good</font>

477
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:58,740
question so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the way I</font>

478
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:02,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um yesterday at the</font>

479
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:05,970
top we gave in track one I spoke<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

480
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:08,550
about context so to me creating a heart

481
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:11,580
of assault bill cipher is primarily not

482
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:13,710
about the mechanics that use to hit the

483
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:17,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">cipher in route I mean clocks whatever</font>

484
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:19,620
time it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really about the context that</font>

485
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:21,330
you said so for example on the card the

486
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,919
fact that the first 26 crimes are

487
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:25,620
illuminated might give you an idea

488
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,300
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that might happen in some</font>

489
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,530
other quest line in the dark that might

490
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,510
have been that somebody talked about

491
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:32,850
base resin take in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote a</font>

492
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:34,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">question about Bates arithmetic so if</font>

493
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:38,219
you are setting yourself up for success

494
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,810
you would immerse yourself in all the

495
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:44,400
contact that's been that's been awkward

496
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:48,600
um so hard to solve cyprus me are about

497
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:51,480
one having a content accessible to doing

498
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,129
the right direction so for example in

499
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,610
the gates of the cards that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were hints</font>

500
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:58,410
that were provided and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were</font>

501
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:00,300
getting closer and closer more and more

502
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:03,600
people started to trade information so

503
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:06,030
we also like to socialize we have we

504
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,709
have an encourage group chatter just

505
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,660
like the badge challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that kind of</font>

506
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:12,090
you don't know it all throughout<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

507
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:14,670
continent that on there are clues in all

508
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:16,709
the artwork on all the programs<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

509
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:19,770
the materials the badges you get and

510
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,360
people are encouraged to share that

511
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:24,240
freely because there's no way to put all

512
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,330
the context together by yourself now in

513
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,670
our case we're more limited we bring

514
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,870
that context into the dark net but then

515
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,580
you have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the second thing</font>

516
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,709
is to choose of what I would call a

517
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,580
relatable

518
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:39,679
mechanic in this case base arithmetic

519
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,270
maybe not that relatable but for

520
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,980
computer science and people who might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

521
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:45,529
near you doing this other stuff that's

522
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:47,270
very familiar and so there's a knowledge

523
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:48,740
source right nearby that's familiar with

524
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:50,600
that kind of mechanic the one I'm going

525
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do for this year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to be</font>

526
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:57,500
similarly geeky but not quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

527
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,390
relating to weird now but let's help it

528
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,630
all up bring on to that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

529
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:04,700
previous of my current interest in 15

530
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:10,279
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to human streets one of them's</font>

531
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:11,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">I learned is that you never know nobody</font>

532
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:14,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">that buys your game enjoy honey what is</font>

533
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:16,460
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the designer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and ink team not</font>

534
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,929
upon death on a fun game so you have to

535
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:20,299
provide just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero side enough</font>

536
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:22,789
context the only men easy-like we did

537
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:24,200
pretty well dark netted we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

538
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:26,390
separate story writers<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right the</font>

539
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">entire story and then we wrap the quests</font>

540
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,770
around the story when we're done so the

541
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,929
story actually has hints and for every

542
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:36,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">single question as you go through it a</font>

543
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:40,010
couple of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things about dark net</font>

544
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:43,190
like last year we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had the kind</font>

545
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:47,360
of climax of the story was the agents
