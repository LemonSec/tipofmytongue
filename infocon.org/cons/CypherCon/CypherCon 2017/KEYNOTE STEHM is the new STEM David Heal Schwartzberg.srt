64
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:58,069
front row today so when you see somebody

65
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,170
using a mobile device these days and we

66
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:02,869
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy they are to use I think</font>

67
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,480
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> then Benny might have been two and</font>

68
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:08,629
a half of three and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet he didn't really</font>

69
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,720
speak much but whenever he spoke it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

70
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:13,310
um you know to unlock his tablet and he

71
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,889
would as you could see say the pass code

72
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,410
out loud and it took us about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a year to</font>

73
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:21,560
teach him first<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not do that second</font>

74
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:23,090
to change his pass code so then only he

75
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,669
and I would know it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he would even</font>

76
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell mommy he can't share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it with her</font>

77
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:31,730
which i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is actually great progress</font>

78
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:34,250
who do you your<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers that you work</font>

79
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,858
<font color="#CCCCCC">with or that you support does this</font>

80
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">remind you of them in any way sharing</font>

81
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:43,790
pass codes when they shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be simple</font>

82
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:46,489
pass codes on mobile devices well<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

83
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,500
the future generation as they're

84
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:51,290
learning how to protect their privacy

85
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,780
and data and keep themselves from not

86
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:56,690
becoming a victim there's still a lot of

87
00:03:53,780 --> 00:04:00,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">adults that are victims it really kind</font>

88
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,370
of comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to awareness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or training</font>

89
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:04,340
however you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to call it whatever</font>

90
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,650
term you prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> but this is the big part</font>

91
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,099
of it it's always the human element the

92
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:12,109
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a tool it's us we're</font>

93
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:16,130
the weakness and we have to start

94
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:19,820
teaching youths and adults and seniors

95
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:21,289
about the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> practices that we all</font>

96
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,690
know and pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do</font>

97
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:24,979
instinctually nowadays once you've been

98
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,980
drained you know what to do so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

99
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:28,349
to teach<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

100
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:33,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going and playing the long game by</font>

101
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:36,240
teaching kids so now on to the topic so

102
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,520
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands who's heard of stem maybe i</font>

103
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,830
should say<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's not heard of stem right</font>

104
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,380
science<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology engineering and math</font>

105
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,700
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was created back in 1997 by the</font>

106
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">National Science Foundation when they</font>

107
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,370
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting out grants to foster these</font>

108
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">types of disciplines and methodologies</font>

109
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:56,550
within education whether it's university

110
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,770
or high school or middle school so they

111
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:02,580
were providing a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> funding to help</font>

112
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:05,849
this nation catch up with other nations

113
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:09,330
in the world that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are leading us and</font>

114
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:12,300
then in 2010 somebody came out with a

115
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:15,120
website that's called<font color="#CCCCCC"> steam not stem</font>

116
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,620
because they believe art should also be

117
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,330
included and I'm not saying it shouldn't

118
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,760
but just kind of the whole history<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

119
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,919
how the acronym has been changing and

120
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:26,010
you know there's a valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> point to that</font>

121
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,590
but are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really falling behind in art</font>

122
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:32,340
yes or<font color="#E5E5E5"> no we can have that debate later</font>

123
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:34,530
and then 2014 Rob Berman wrote an

124
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,590
article for The Huffington<font color="#E5E5E5"> Post where</font>

125
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:41,849
he's saying no no it's not steam<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

126
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:45,539
stream which includes reading so again

127
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:48,030
another important skill to have Benny

128
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,710
back in that video not able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read but</font>

129
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,260
can definitely get into his tablet to

130
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,840
watch a<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube video doesn't take much</font>

131
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:58,890
skill there right but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point</font>

132
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,869
we do need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have our youth and adults</font>

133
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:04,260
reading more you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only acronym</font>

134
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,660
rtfm we need to do it more but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

135
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm still focusing really on stem and</font>

136
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,570
then there's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just heard</font>

137
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,870
about there's a grant now from NSF

138
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:15,570
called steamed sea which includes

139
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,550
computing and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also can I guess</font>

140
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,710
technology and engineering but they have

141
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">one very specific for computing the</font>

142
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:27,090
prior administration also felt very

143
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,380
strongly about this because in 2015 he

144
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,580
put out something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just read it in</font>

145
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">case you can't see it well it's big</font>

146
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,370
enough but science is an approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

147
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:37,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">world a critical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to understand and</font>

148
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,660
explore and<font color="#E5E5E5"> engage with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the world and</font>

149
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:45,450
then have the capacity

150
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:48,390
city to change that world hmm<font color="#CCCCCC"> I remind</font>

151
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:52,349
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> of anything where are we at hmm</font>

152
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:57,330
think about it he went even further and

153
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:58,830
then authorized 250 million dollars to

154
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,039
be made available for grants for

155
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,659
education with stem and forced them in

156
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,120
addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what they've already been</font>

157
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,450
doing since 1997 that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool in</font>

158
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,400
my opinion and today there's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

159
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,960
of grants available and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

160
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:18,900
talk a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in a</font>

161
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:21,030
bit even the news<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there's a CSL</font>

162
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,789
online reported that there's going to be

163
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:28,380
zero percent cybersecurity employment

164
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:32,490
and 1 million jobs are unfilled<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1</font>

165
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:34,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">million that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of jobs and then</font>

166
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,060
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what are we going to do</font>

167
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,110
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so swag or speak with a</font>

168
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,460
geek I don't know if you guys heard it

169
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,400
than they were at these sides Las Vegas

170
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:44,520
in 2016 going<font color="#CCCCCC"> around and interviewing</font>

171
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,900
some folks and asking them what do you

172
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,490
think we should do and there were some

173
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,469
people that essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> were struggling</font>

174
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,730
shrugging their shoulders and they don't

175
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,500
know what we should do and some people

176
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,210
had some interesting ideas and some

177
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,340
people had some cutesy ideas and if you

178
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,900
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that video yourself there's</font>

179
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,820
the bit ly there you can take a quick

180
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,770
picture if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like and then check it</font>

181
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,110
out it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually worth the time you</font>

182
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:07,140
spend but this is how I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

183
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:09,510
video<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is my opinion on it if we</font>

184
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,940
teach them young even if they don't fill

185
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:14,340
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec positions they're going to</font>

186
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,840
be leading with security and whatever

187
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,950
they do and whatever career they choose

188
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,619
I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just as important as</font>

189
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:24,840
having a million<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec jobs if the</font>

190
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,210
people who are in positions to make

191
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,190
decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about engineering products</font>

192
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,690
whether they're an infosec or not but

193
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,240
they're thinking about security first

194
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,250
we'll solve some of our problems before

195
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,520
we know about them agree or disagree

196
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:42,960
anytime folks I know it's in the

197
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:44,880
afternoon so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got one agree thank you</font>

198
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,120
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy you some ice cream</font>

199
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,540
later so how do we come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this so</font>

200
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">two agrees</font>

201
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:56,120
I'll get you an ice cream too sir

202
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:58,880
compact channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> chata</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> friend of mine</font>

203
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">chris is strong big in ICS and scada we</font>

204
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,689
were kind of just talking in a chat

205
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:04,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this kind of problem and and you</font>

206
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the real simple version of it was</font>

207
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,110
well how do we integrate hacking into

208
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:11,569
stem and does it really make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

209
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,889
does it belong there does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> not and you</font>

210
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:15,800
know so we're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with all these</font>

211
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:18,259
different like versions of the acronym

212
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:22,519
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe stem dash</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> H would have been</font>

213
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:26,600
good but we tried you know stem with

214
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:28,790
like the s and the tea and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> H all</font>

215
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:33,350
mixed around but we also tried one that

216
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:37,160
was m.i.t HS and we realize that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

217
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:40,370
really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with stem then</font>

218
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,259
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> H is kind of silent I mean if you</font>

219
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:46,279
got like upper respiratory problem you

220
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:49,040
can call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> or if you know you're Jewish</font>

221
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:51,889
like me you could say stem like you got

222
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to clear your throat but you know we</font>

223
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:55,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chris through this in there like what</font>

224
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,620
you're talking about what is this stem

225
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,170
thing so you know Chris and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> and our</font>

226
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,240
idea we present to you introducing

227
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,849
hacking into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concept of science</font>

228
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology engineering and math now stem</font>

229
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:11,779
with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> H or whatever other version you</font>

230
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:15,139
want to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use mths what</font>

231
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:17,360
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> will we do this well some people</font>

232
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:20,269
would argue that hacking doesn't belong

233
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,940
there science & mathematics our

234
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:26,839
disciplines and methodologies used to

235
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:29,480
solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems right technology and</font>

236
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:33,740
engineering apply science and

237
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:36,170
mathematics to solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems isn't</font>

238
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:39,620
hacking the application of all four of

239
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,029
those to solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems I just got</font>

240
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,540
chills saying that doesn't it belong

241
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:45,709
there and if you argue and disagree we

242
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:50,810
could talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it later because I'd</font>

243
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:53,180
love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear your side of it so you know</font>

244
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:55,099
why do we have hackers nowadays it's

245
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,079
kind of some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have gone back</font>

246
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,240
you remember this guy this was a Packard

247
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,430
Bell don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even ask me which processor</font>

248
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,960
it was an old one<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

249
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:06,479
hobbyist right i remember my 286 is like

250
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,310
cool but it's like it's a hobby and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

251
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,740
and then later we kind of like get

252
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:13,050
curious and we we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a BBS or</font>

253
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,120
something and we find some cookbooks and

254
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:17,069
we start reading them and getting ideas

255
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,530
and we kind of start to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about well</font>

256
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,180
you know Mike used an example of what

257
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,339
Zelda and dropping bombs to find a

258
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,900
secret but I know somebody who was going

259
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,960
further than that was actually reverse

260
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:30,900
engineering diablo 2 in order to create

261
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,010
fake items just to beat the game but you

262
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,569
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know him back then but</font>

263
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,100
that caused my account to get suspended

264
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,470
to somehow<font color="#CCCCCC"> i bought one of those items</font>

265
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:41,130
in an auction and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was really just a</font>

266
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:43,680
teenager's incentive to<font color="#CCCCCC"> win</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

267
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:46,080
incentives a big part of what we do just

268
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">even the mune o to face the webpage back</font>

269
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,620
in the day and now to define<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Eau de</font>

270
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,300
that's going to get us a ton of money

271
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,160
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see some of these folks have</font>

272
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,199
actually made some pretty nice careers

273
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,660
there's there's Kevin from Mandya now

274
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,250
fire i I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry yeah fire i bought</font>

275
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Manion sorry for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moment little brain</font>

276
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,660
fart and then there's Mike where is he

277
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,949
this was actually a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little gift to him</font>

278
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,079
so there's a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of him wearing a</font>

279
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:11,340
ton of badges at Def Con in one of his

280
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:13,680
signature Hawaiian shirts but also the

281
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:15,360
media has been taking up on this I love

282
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,030
the one that's in black and white if you

283
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:22,410
can't read it says hackers can turn your

284
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:25,380
home computer into a bomb who's ever

285
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:27,270
done that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right Aaron I know you</font>

286
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,060
have all right we got 11 confession

287
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,980
right it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ridiculous and then</font>

288
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,170
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next the sub was like and blow your</font>

289
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,240
family to smoother mean it's like so

290
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,310
hilarious and then there's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other one</font>

291
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,990
where it's like those damn hackers you

292
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,000
know they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack the dam so that</font>

293
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,730
was justifiable but you know it's always

294
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,190
breaking into these these services like

295
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,540
public services and ICS and then the

296
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">media right it seems like they're</font>

297
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:53,099
finally kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of listening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to us and</font>

298
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,680
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right with mr. robot who's</font>

299
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,870
not watching that series no public

300
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,880
shaming no<font color="#E5E5E5"> public shame and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the hands</font>

301
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,920
went down real quick no you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch</font>

302
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,360
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you're opposed to watching it</font>

303
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">for whatever your political views that's</font>

304
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,980
fine but they're really illustrating

305
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,650
kind of the stuff the tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use</font>

306
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,610
every day and the thought process grant

307
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,560
that there's some things in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

308
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,029
are probably not

309
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,790
you know things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to teach kids</font>

310
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:20,130
but the idea is it's it's not like

311
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:22,829
watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> the net or some of those other</font>

312
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:26,250
movies so the media is finally listening

313
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:28,560
and getting it so education this is

314
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,390
really where it comes down to so there's

315
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,099
all this grant money in this funding but

316
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:34,650
when you kind of look at the education

317
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,860
so being a parent of having a kid who's

318
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:41,670
11 9<font color="#CCCCCC"> and five excuse me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I only really</font>

319
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,230
get exposure to whatever education level

320
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,240
they're at so like when they're in high

321
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,440
school I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be doing with high</font>

322
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,700
schools when they're in college I'm

323
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:54,540
probably doing a lot more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a college</font>

324
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:56,339
excuse me so I'm working with middle

325
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,310
schools of elementary schools now to

326
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,870
bolster their stem even<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

327
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,060
let's just have a FIRST LEGO League team

328
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,710
meeting here let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do a demo get</font>

329
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,229
people interested in robotics and

330
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,640
robotic programming and solving<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems</font>

331
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,589
through the mechanical engineering that

332
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,089
comes with robotics just to kind of

333
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:15,180
foster some of that through hack for

334
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:17,400
kids but when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about like okay</font>

335
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,530
well why would kids make good hackers

336
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:23,939
well first and foremost they question

337
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:26,790
authority right other ones they're quite

338
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,560
persistent as a parent how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

339
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,719
have had you know your kids you they

340
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,979
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> something and you say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay maybe</font>

341
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,610
and like they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get excited with me</font>

342
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,900
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not know but when they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

343
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,010
son just<font color="#CCCCCC"> told me that the other day goes</font>

344
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">I love it when you say maybe because</font>

345
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:43,020
it's not know but when it's like you say

346
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,510
like not right now it's very very

347
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,579
persistent and and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good that's a</font>

348
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,439
good hacker trait to have so we do want

349
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to be persistent but also</font>

350
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,060
constructive with it they're very

351
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,250
innovative and I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> some fun</font>

352
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,079
examples of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming up soon because</font>

353
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,550
they want it they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to turn things</font>

354
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,500
upside down look at it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

355
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,359
angles see what they can do with it

356
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,000
break their toys and see if they can fix

357
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,490
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make them better and great</font>

358
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,900
social engineers in our house my kids

359
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up to me and ask me for</font>

360
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:17,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">something and I'll say what did your mom</font>

361
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:19,770
say run off she said to ask you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

362
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:23,459
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> after a while they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just</font>

363
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:26,160
answer with she<font color="#E5E5E5"> said to ask you without</font>

364
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:27,150
asking mom first little social engineer

365
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,100
right there

366
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,689
so you know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting wiser to his</font>

367
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:35,190
methodologies and he's adapting and

368
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:36,690
innovating to our countermeasures here's

369
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">another great case study so you can say</font>

370
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:41,280
like they're starting a third grade but

371
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,860
even younger<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kid here he was five</font>

372
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,530
years old his dad works in<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT they had</font>

373
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,120
an xbox dad was busy working and the kid

374
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,880
wanted to play with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the xbox if you can</font>

375
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,470
find the video it's really adorable but

376
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,020
the kids SAT there and he's just mashing

377
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:57,480
keys at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> login prompt until he caused</font>

378
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,579
the buffer overflow five girls don't

379
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,290
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> buffer overflows are but he</font>

380
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,000
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it got in and he logged in</font>

381
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,620
and he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing video games and when</font>

382
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,300
you watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's kind of one of those</font>

383
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,800
of the videos like yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was just</font>

384
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,349
hitting the buttons and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it logged in so</font>

385
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,089
I could play games yeah the kid was

386
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,590
thrilled<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he actually got credit for</font>

387
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:18,060
Microsoft for<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding a vulnerability</font>

388
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:21,780
that they patched five years old<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

389
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:24,000
there's Benny Benny is very a computer's

390
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:26,490
as all my<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids are but you know we'll</font>

391
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,540
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just use many as an example of</font>

392
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:32,250
the the barrier or the age like age

393
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,010
barrier for computers is going lower and

394
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:37,620
lower and lower reading is not a comp

395
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:41,970
like a requirement any more patients

396
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:44,100
sorta any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mass not necessary at</font>

397
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,990
all doesn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> take much two year</font>

398
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,420
olds can log in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and start swiping and</font>

399
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,640
tapping icons it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

400
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:55,229
simple to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use what problems is that</font>

401
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:58,319
creating for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and education here's</font>

402
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:00,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">another fun example so this was from one</font>

403
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,940
that Chris<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sistrunk son did I think he</font>

404
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:05,160
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like ear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nine when he did it and who</font>

405
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,860
has ever heard of MIT scratch a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

406
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,240
fun it's like Legos for programming it's

407
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,379
really cool even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're an adult and</font>

408
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,329
you really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to code you</font>

409
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,130
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> an add a code this is actually a</font>

410
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:15,599
pretty good starting point because

411
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,250
things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> color-coded they snap</font>

412
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,810
together if they should and you just

413
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,829
kind of drop them almost wherever you

414
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:22,230
want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to worry too much</font>

415
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:24,449
about syntax and indentation and stuff

416
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,849
like that or even commenting but<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

417
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:29,100
here's one where Chris's son was going

418
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:30,480
to make a pong game and you know he

419
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,060
wants to innovate so in this particular

420
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,510
case he's like well every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time there's</font>

421
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:38,879
like the ball is hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> by player 1 create</font>

422
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,129
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> random color player 2 random</font>

423
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">color</font>

424
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,720
um just kind of making it psychedelic

425
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,060
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then he had it where it was like</font>

426
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,920
growing it feels like<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a big</font>

427
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,470
psychedelic blinking light on the

428
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,750
computer he also had like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the paddle of</font>

429
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,310
the other plane so every time like he

430
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,160
hit it as player<font color="#E5E5E5"> one his paddle got</font>

431
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:59,270
bigger player to paddle got smaller so

432
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,180
he's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of having all these kind</font>

433
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">of fun things what do you think a</font>

434
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:11,270
nine-year-old would name a pong fun pong

435
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:12,620
program like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know it's funny and</font>

436
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:18,379
it's cute but really are we any

437
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:20,570
different no I don't think so so here's

438
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">some case studies kind of backup the</font>

439
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:24,409
point about education there's there's a

440
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:27,169
lot going on but I still<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font>

441
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:29,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's enough half the kids example you</font>

442
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:32,060
know is the one I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> very closely I'll</font>

443
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,710
spare you folks with you know my

444
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,179
participating about it but we're going

445
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do an event with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Slifer Connor on</font>

446
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:40,430
Saturday which I'm very thrilled about

447
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,990
it's like pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> sold out and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

448
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,910
was that was kind of really unexpected

449
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,190
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know we didn't really</font>

450
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,450
promote that hard we just growing pains

451
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,430
and one of your prepared but it's going

452
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:52,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be here so if you know anybody who</font>

453
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:54,500
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring someone from age of 7 to</font>

454
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,760
17 and we're still going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to accept some</font>

455
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,350
walk-ins because we expect there'll be a

456
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,970
little attrition but we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

457
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,620
prepared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle some walk-in so if</font>

458
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:03,200
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys want to bring somebody that</font>

459
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,879
that'd be cool roots roots asylum

460
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,590
formerly known as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Def Con kid that was</font>

470
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:29,630
there's stuff for adults like interrupt

471
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:32,000
there's also cyber patriot and cyber

472
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:34,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">Patriot while it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of began</font>

473
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,470
with high school it's all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

474
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,020
the middle school and they even<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

475
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:41,600
something for elementary so we're

476
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:44,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">starting to teach kids red teaming and</font>

477
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,889
blue teaming at a really early age like

478
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,300
almost at the time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're really</font>

479
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">learning how to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a computer which i</font>

480
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,810
think is really really cool there's

481
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,260
another program<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just learned about</font>

482
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:54,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I'm going to get involved with</font>

483
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,920
called jen cyber<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had a really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

484
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,540
opportunity to speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> with somebody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

485
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,330
the National Science Foundation last

486
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:04,320
week and she was<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling me about this</font>

487
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:05,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">program where it's different ages I want</font>

488
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get into too much of details because</font>

489
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time constraint but if you</font>

490
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,370
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like high school age that's</font>

491
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:15,270
correct but it all goes all the way down

492
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:19,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">to middle school</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have any</font>

493
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:21,510
programs in Illinois or Wisconsin here's

494
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:24,390
a great opportunity for all of us here

495
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:26,820
from this area to start a program to

496
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,980
file a grant and then to begin some of

497
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,889
this education that's very local to us

498
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,840
one one bit of advice on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you</font>

499
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,270
decide to do it you have to partner

500
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,010
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to it makes it a</font>

501
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:42,180
lot easier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if you partner with</font>

502
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:44,160
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> established education entity so like</font>

503
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,620
in like an edu or middle school<font color="#CCCCCC"> or high</font>

504
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,260
school and have it as a partnership

505
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,250
rather than hi my name is Bob and I want

506
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,020
some money because i'm going to teach

507
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,270
kids how to hack that doesn't go over

508
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,860
very well you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually get</font>

509
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,170
partnered<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a school that's going to</font>

510
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,520
have like pedagogy experts who can then

511
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,440
just say okay this is what we're going

512
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,600
to do have rubrics and measure it and

513
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:08,070
and then report back<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you know all</font>

your success so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm am i doing on</font>

515
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:15,179
time that I'm okay good sorry to be

516
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,580
mindful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the next presenter who's</font>

517
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,050
staring at me<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now so I want to</font>

518
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:22,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you a little story because i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

519
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:25,470
the stories are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real big takeaways</font>

520
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:31,110
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about Bob and I</font>

521
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:33,000
met Bob like it was in 2015 at Circle

522
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:36,719
City<font color="#E5E5E5"> con in Indianapolis we did a</font>

523
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,210
village<font color="#E5E5E5"> there hack the kids village Bob</font>

524
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,340
like computers Bob's 14 and Bob said

525
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,920
yeah oh this stuff is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll learn and</font>

526
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:46,050
there was a spy math or crypto corner I

527
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:49,320
think we call it at the time and he sat

528
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:50,490
down he goes what is this stuff so the

529
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,050
admin or that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we call our</font>

530
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:54,780
volunteers was there with Bob and

531
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:57,570
teaching them<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to decode binary and</font>

532
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,920
showed him very like a rotation<font color="#E5E5E5"> cipher</font>

533
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">their simple Caesar ciphers what</font>

534
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,360
everyone to call them and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> even like</font>

535
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,620
other kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like monoalphabetic</font>

536
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,399
substitution ciphers lie

537
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:14,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">bionicle is a common one or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Pigpen even</font>

538
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:16,780
base64 and bob was<font color="#CCCCCC"> really into cracking</font>

539
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,880
these things like he just did not want

540
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,920
to stop and do anything else we had a

541
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,400
lot of the fun things going on but this

542
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,140
is what bob loved Bob had no idea this

543
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,870
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that he would be very</font>

544
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's really</font>

545
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,709
what we're about is is really

546
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,870
introducing all these different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

547
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,490
methodologies and disciplines that we

548
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,080
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of take for granted or we use tools</font>

549
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:40,750
for but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've wanted to sit there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

550
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">crack these codes manually he was there</font>

551
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,070
all day and got through I think we had

552
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,100
eight and got to all eight of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

553
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:49,629
manually which is impressive especially

554
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,178
for a 14 year old that has no prior

555
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:54,460
experience and what I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> also very</font>

556
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:55,750
interesting is just like when my kids

557
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,700
come home from school and I go how was

558
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:00,010
your day would you learn no clue what

559
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,330
you do nothing okay you're there all day

560
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,179
and you did nothing what does my tax

561
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:06,760
dollars going to but with Bob it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font>

562
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:08,559
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing Bob when his dad said oh I</font>

563
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,450
was hacked<font color="#E5E5E5"> for kids I was good would you</font>

564
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,580
learn nothing but I wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> an email to</font>

565
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:15,400
Bob's dad because we had some other

566
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,470
prior interactions and I let<font color="#E5E5E5"> him know</font>

567
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,730
how he impressed all of us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

568
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:21,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that he should really</font>

569
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,110
explore with his son because he really

570
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,149
was starting to develop a proficiency

571
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,250
for it and rather than letting it fall

572
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:30,160
to the wayside they should definitely go

573
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:33,370
further and he wrote back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's like</font>

574
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,320
I had no idea my son told me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was</font>

575
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,629
just fun and he didn't say what<font color="#CCCCCC"> he did</font>

576
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,080
and I'm really appreciative of you guys

577
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:43,570
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know doing what you do and letting</font>

578
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,970
me know what my son now knows and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

579
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:48,909
he likes or loves and I'm definitely

580
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:52,929
going to pursue it further with him that

581
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:54,850
to me is highly valuable because Bob

582
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:57,220
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who is</font>

583
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,860
somebody that writes an algorithm right

584
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,450
the next day here<font color="#CCCCCC"> L</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jamel that writes an</font>

585
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,490
algorithm to protect our data on the

586
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if he is or not</font>

587
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,000
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to keep in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> touch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

588
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,160
Bob and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stock them and see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

589
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,610
he does but we hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've made a</font>

590
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:14,320
difference in<font color="#E5E5E5"> his life so someone else's</font>

591
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:17,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">life that I know we made a difference in</font>

592
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,970
is Alice I want to by the way Bob went

593
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,200
back to two<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

594
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,730
the kids after that we saw him in

595
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chicago and we saw him again in</font>

596
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:30,940
indianapolis in 2016 so Alice we met her

597
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:34,330
in Detroit so we did another village

598
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:37,360
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> that besides Detroit and Alice had</font>

599
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:40,750
a really rough start<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this to me is</font>

600
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">it makes me feel really good about what</font>

601
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:46,240
we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the people whose lives</font>

602
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:48,700
we really are changing Alice was born

603
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,679
into a household with parents that had

604
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,090
chemical addictions one was alcohol and

605
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:54,909
one was drugs I don't know which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

606
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:58,149
which it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't matter but um so she</font>

607
00:24:54,909 --> 00:25:00,820
was she was growing<font color="#CCCCCC"> up without basic</font>

608
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:03,250
necessities or taking like like my kids

609
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,830
take for granted of sweeping in a warm

610
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:09,309
bed every night having clothes that fit

611
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:13,000
eating three meals a day or more take a

612
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:15,158
look at us we well my moms are<font color="#E5E5E5"> great all</font>

613
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time pipes a great cook their mom so</font>

614
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:19,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know she didn't have these things</font>

615
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">are even going to school regularly okay</font>

616
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:25,510
but then she was adopted by a couple

617
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:27,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and IT and they came to hack for</font>

618
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:30,640
kids or besides Detroit where he had the

619
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:32,200
Africans in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basement and she's like</font>

620
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,809
kind of interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in computers but</font>

621
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,630
again like Bob now not very proficient

622
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:39,850
so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we did there</font>

623
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:41,919
was we had a super bot competition right

624
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:43,209
a lot of fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get ev3 you start</font>

625
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">building it out you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put like a</font>

626
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:48,190
nice big wall in front of it and destroy

627
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:50,590
other BOTS where we do this we<font color="#CCCCCC"> has about</font>

628
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:54,580
12 kids there she was the second one to

629
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:56,500
go and have her bot compete and she beat

630
00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:01,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first person and everybody after</font>

631
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:05,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that nobody else beat Alice and because</font>

632
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:08,200
we had a prize for first place<font color="#CCCCCC"> she won a</font>

633
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:09,549
$25 gift card which you know to us 25

634
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,350
bucks that might be a meal or and I

635
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:13,750
drinking or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something but to somebody</font>

636
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:16,059
who was brought who he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> born into the</font>

637
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:19,780
world like Alice that's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money</font>

638
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:24,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a big deal and she</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was thrilled</font>

639
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:26,799
but wait it gets better we also do an

640
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:28,870
online CTF so we had some of those kind

641
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,120
of crypto challenges she<font color="#CCCCCC"> got through</font>

642
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,879
just about all of those and her mom was

643
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,958
with her

644
00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:35,418
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do is we tell</font>

645
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:37,579
the parents you know ask your kids if

646
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:39,919
they look stuck if they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> like time</font>

647
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:42,709
or coaching don't kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hover over</font>

648
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,419
them or helicopter and enforce them to

649
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:46,279
do you want them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it you want them</font>

650
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:48,079
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make mistakes so they can learn so</font>

651
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:49,909
she did<font color="#E5E5E5"> very well and I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> observed</font>

652
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,009
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> her mom was very respectful of our</font>

653
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:53,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">request we had some social engineering</font>

654
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:55,729
and OSN stuff she<font color="#E5E5E5"> was able to get</font>

655
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:57,259
through that pretty easily<font color="#CCCCCC"> lockpicking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

656
00:26:55,729 --> 00:26:58,969
think she popped most of the locks we go

657
00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:02,029
up to 16 I think she got as far as five

658
00:26:58,969 --> 00:27:03,949
so she got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of points there we had</font>

659
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:06,469
some electronic badges that we had

660
00:27:03,949 --> 00:27:07,819
custom built last year so<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was the</font>

661
00:27:06,469 --> 00:27:09,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">only one that was able to figure it out</font>

662
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:10,940
we had three badges and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was three</font>

663
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:13,668
different codes and she figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the</font>

664
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:15,739
code on the first badge so she got

665
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:18,499
points for that and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all our</font>

666
00:27:15,739 --> 00:27:22,759
hard work she tied for first place in

667
00:27:18,499 --> 00:27:24,769
the CDF she tied never having<font color="#CCCCCC"> done any</font>

668
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:27,169
of this stuff before with another kid

669
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:28,909
whose parent works in infosec and may or

670
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:31,159
may not a coach that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of</font>

671
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:33,079
create any kind of controversy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

672
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:35,659
was great<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now she got to pick a</font>

673
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:37,158
prize from all the prizes that we head

674
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:40,699
out she picked a conic hit so now she

675
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:43,909
got 525 dollars and a cool fun

676
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:46,190
low-powered hacking platform that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

677
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:50,029
great day for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and for her</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

678
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:51,859
more for us so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get out of we</font>

679
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:53,389
go further we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to engage students we</font>

680
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:55,399
need to be mentors we need to teach the

684
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:03,139
about raspberry PI's there's crypto

685
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:04,609
challenges you can go even Python for

686
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:06,439
kids we've done stuff like that but you

687
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:08,119
know getting any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these books will</font>

688
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,579
help the kids start to develop some of

00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:14,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">these skills</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hacks for kids always has a</font>

17 and you're not present you don't get

694
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:24,739
a prize I don't send me<font color="#E5E5E5"> an email asking</font>

701
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,660
but the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with being a hacker is</font>

702
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:43,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">the overall public perception so we need</font>

703
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:46,810
to stop talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about cyber criminals as</font>

704
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:49,840
hackers hackers are innovators we find

705
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:53,139
flaws we push technology further without

706
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,060
us we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> still be using a trs-80 model 3</font>

707
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:57,070
with the 48 k ram that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have in my</font>

708
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:59,260
garage my wife wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to throw away so</font>

709
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:03,010
please stop using the term hacker

710
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:07,120
synonymous with cyber criminal it's also

711
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:09,070
funding and like where to go so here's

712
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,409
like Wisconsin's quick nap<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found this</font>

713
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:15,639
so anyone a member of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Appleton</font>

714
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:19,150
makerspace nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay are they still</font>

715
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,950

716
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:27,220
to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them a call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or an email sector</font>

717
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:29,530
67 Bueller the Milwaukee hackerspace you

718
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,540
see the icon up there so there's a lot

719
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:33,220

721
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,760
this would be fun to throw up there and

722
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,410

call first and a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are going</font>

724
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:45,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> funding from NSF if</font>

725
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,920
there are 501 C 3 so you can create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

726
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">hacker space or join one and help them</font>

727
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,960
out get some funding I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost done</font>

728
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:55,270
also the proximity you know we're not

729
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,640
all so close together I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know Wisconsin</font>

730
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:59,950
the big state and a lot of farmland and

castle on the way home but when you're

734
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,990
out there in the rural areas there's the

735
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:10,690
rural<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology fund so there's ways</font>

736
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:15,610
even for people who are farming the land

737
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:17,650
to get money to teach their kids stem we

738
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,810
need you everybody here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is responsible</font>

739

the detailed about my contest it is a

780
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:36,500
cipher and puzzle challenge it is not

781
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:38,450
necessarily encryption so you're not

782
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,270
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be breaking RSA encryption or</font>

783
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:45,380
learning algorithms it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> make you</font>

three ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a lifetime badge so</font>
