again Minnesota and Wisconsin very

Colorado and Wyoming which are just big

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,610
minutes is easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let me tell you</font>

33
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,400
a little bit about what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

34
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,490
talk about and who I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is foam</font>

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,140
foam is the title of a novel<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets I'll</font>

get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the advertisements out of the way</font>

37
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,630
it's a novel that I spent a lifetime

38
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:53,699
learning enough to write and it came out

39
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:55,920
a year ago and this poster is the cover

40
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,979
of the third volume it's three little

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,810
volumes are one big volume and what it

42
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,539
suggests is that information<font color="#CCCCCC"> and energy</font>

43
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,360
transfers in the universe it transits

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,369
and it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're individual</font>

entities the bubbles but there are Jason

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,149
talking to Nicole about where an idea

<font color="#E5E5E5">and he said he could affect things</font>

his name was helper dog to blow his mind

63
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,310
because he actually affected things

64
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:59,400
physically and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

determine the effectiveness and the

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:35,129
truthfulness of it and they worked well

80
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:37,048
and I've talked to both hell over the

was that information is streaming

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,960
developed ways just like our bodies with

very complex wonderful immune systems to

00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,320
and an anomaly that doesn't fit

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,810

terrific talk about how kids can be

160
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,040
this is what hacking is this is also

161
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:21,210
what sciences scientists<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hackers</font>

162
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:24,000
share obsession and daring as as traits

163
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,969
that they have to have you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,970
obsessive you have to be daring you have

165
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:33,000
to be bold and you have to just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

166
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:36,600
click and the traits that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you enumerated</font>

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,140
persistence and so on fit that exactly

168
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:42,000
so so we are built not to be hackers and

169
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:48,150
that's why the hackers I've gotten to

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,390
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> over many years are a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> niche smoking</font>

to DEFCON 4 21 straight years now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

172
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:56,789
often say that it's the home to which I

173
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,340
love to go the psychic home because it's

174
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:02,400
one of the only places that I can go

175
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,890
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain anything</font>

176
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,710
where everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets where everybody</font>

177

178
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:12,630
doing there a foam seemed to me an

179
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,460
appropriate image for the non-local

180
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,860
consciousness that exists in the

181
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,049
universe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sources of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the innovative and imaginative ideas</font>

183
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:25,020
that simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to ping in in our minds</font>

184
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,659
and that's why this little poster these

are<font color="#CCCCCC"> available free downstairs if you</font>

188
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:43,319
the illustrator Duncan long captured my

189
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,950
stance before the universe and I think

190
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:50,580
some of yours we stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> in awe and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wonder</font>

191
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:53,430
before the complexity of the universe

192
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,570
and in UFO lore which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to</font>

193
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into too much here</font>

194
00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:00,450
there are wonderful stories in UFO lore

195
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:02,340
and one of them is during an encounter a

196
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,160
person said he had with an<font color="#CCCCCC"> alien being</font>

197
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,810
and he said are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the watchman Bailey</font>

198
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,480
and said are you the watchman over this

199
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:12,239
place to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> policeman and he said yes</font>

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the alien theoretically</font>

the universe now that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way a</font>

or not the edge of wonder that explores

a different paradigm or model of reality

218

great conversations over three or four

years off-site about ways to implement

ethical constraints on some of the

talked about here of course unless he

said well as you start writing fiction

234
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:44,939

292
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:08,040
be not illusory or fictitious it has to

293
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,140
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect and it has to be anomalous</font>

294
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,240
because if it challenges the model of

295
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,100
reality which you currently use to

296
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,840
understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is happening around you</font>

297
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:21,840
then if you pursue it as twining did and

298
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,280
as some others did before 1953

299
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,580
the CIA<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the Air Force</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and Navy</font>

300
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:28,260
adopted a different strategy to deal

301
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,270
with the phenomena which was to downplay

302
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,680
and ridicule and debunk which has been

303
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:34,230
very effective for many years and

304
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">continues to this day this is not</font>

306
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,920
go to youtube and look at my talk on the

307
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,140
book UFOs a government and you'll see

308
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,140
the documentation for that we have the

309
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,840
documents but if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> open minded</font>

310
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:52,199
then it leads to an entirely different

00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,610
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of understanding what's real and of</font>

enumerated in 1953 and then adopted was

315
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,310
so that reverse engineering as best we

316
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,470
could do it inference through inference

317
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:10,349
from the characteristics described by

318
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,790
general twining in 1947 might lead to

319
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,510
new breakthrough discoveries in

new things were possible on the simple

00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:38,160
anomalies and how they challenges one is

348
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,770
the domain of scientific knowledge and

349
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,469
our understanding of what's real the

other is identity the other is identity

351
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:48,180
because you hear a lot about privacy and

352
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,260
I these days because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's being</font>

challenged is being totally wiped out

there is no such thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> as privacy and</font>

356
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,990
I'll say something<font color="#E5E5E5"> more specific about</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a few minutes I did a talk in</font>

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:10,229
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the minister of privacy said one can</font>

only hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this challenging keynote</font>

363
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:15,510
was of course wrong illustrating the

point i had<font color="#E5E5E5"> made earlier in this in the</font>

365
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:20,220
speech that Nietzsche said about new

00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,920
ideas which is when something challenges

367
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:26,370
your understanding you feel fearful and

368
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:29,760
you will accept any explanation he said

369
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:32,280
which ameliorates the fear regardless of

370
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">its relevance to the truth but you will</font>

371
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,800
call it the truth because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font>

372
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:41,010
have that ameliorating hypothesis to

373
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,920
recall the familiar and reinforce the

374
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:46,110
past rather than allow the facts of the

375
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,020

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:49,419
can see clearly looking back what the

then when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are born into that new</font>

build so much of your future<font color="#E5E5E5"> life so</font>

absorbs us in this case from a

hierarchical structure into a

was a kid my mother wanted in a raffle

it was about the size of a refrigerator

447

you know what refrigerator is right

came and SAT there and watched and as I

crouched it what we call tone and Hugh

00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:30,479
everything besides us you know the

582
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:33,509
Greeks called barbarians everybody

583
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:36,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't a Greek and we call space</font>

584
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:40,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">emptiness everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that isn't earth</font>

585
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:42,059
but already we know in our primitive

586
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:46,019
ways that there are thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of planets</font>

587
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:50,158
and some of us suspect and and have<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

588
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:52,829
been told that we know as a fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

589
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,649
there are inhabited planets far beyond

590
00:25:52,829 --> 00:25:58,139
ours and as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you think about</font>

591
00:25:55,649 --> 00:26:00,478
how the solar system evolved and how our

592
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:02,039
galaxy involved we're way out about

593
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:04,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">two-thirds the way out in the spiral arm</font>

594
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:06,389
and other civilizations would have

595
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:08,969
evolved much earlier but if you can

596
00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:11,008
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where we were just 10,000 years</font>

597
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:12,719
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a hundred years ago you take for</font>

00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:14,940
granted electric lights hundred fifty

how new electricity and the wiring<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

601
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:24,269
the grid has been for us so we're going

602
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:27,958
through a phase change of human identity

603
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:32,279
that one's free but actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're all</font>

604
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:34,169
free but that one's even more free we're

605
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:38,609
going through a phase change of human

606
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:41,519
identity mad blaze very brilliant guy

607
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:44,879
said the if he was talking about

608
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:48,330
security and he said the<font color="#E5E5E5"> major problem</font>

609
00:26:44,879 --> 00:26:50,789
in security is the definition of the

00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:53,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> definition the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

611
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:55,649

00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:09,029
generally wrong they're not who we have

the ability of anybody who ever however

that's happening now just read for

647
00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:28,289

places with AI is developing systems of

00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:46,110
as a mother science fiction sort of way

00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:49,020
but to parse information so fast that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

655
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:51,600
can then output new and innovative

658
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,500
see the patterns fast enough so

00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">inevitably a response and emergent</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">think with mastery about their own</font>

domains of expertise is now being

663
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,870
rebalanced by the evolution of AI which

664
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:15,389
gives us solutions to problems we hadn't

665
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:17,790
identified because the machines can read

666
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:21,059
thousands and thousands tens of

667
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:23,280
thousands of articles simultaneously and

668
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:26,160
look for patterns that suggest for

669
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,590
example as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Watson did with a cancer cure</font>

670
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:32,580
three different novel treatments that no

00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,590
formulate because they didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

673
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,090
way see we need a new language to begin

674
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">to articulate what it is we're</font>

rich the mentally capable of hacking and

00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,150
the poor who take refuge in consensual

683

realities that reassure them that the

things articulated but you know you know

what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do they do choose as</font>

00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,510
Nietzsche said that which comforts them

690
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:21,149
and ameliorates fear and we instead have

to confront to fear<font color="#CCCCCC"> fritz perls great</font>

692
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:27,090
psychologist said excitement is anxiety

693
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:29,850
plus oxygen and watching hacker work or

694
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:33,480
being a hacker at work as you feel

695
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:35,428
yourself pumped up by the hint the

696
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">innovation that there's some new way to</font>

00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:40,620
approach this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it begins to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> emerge on</font>

698
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:42,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">the edges of your thinking and then you</font>

699
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:45,030
pursue it not<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing if it will work</font>

700
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:47,460
like Edison said of every filament that

701
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:49,590
failed that's one I know now won't work

702
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,180
until he got to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundredth filament</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and we had light bulbs</font>

704
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:57,390

705
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:02,459
aesthetic beauty to watch a human mind

locked in and in trance and one with the

707
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,770
machine or at least loving the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine I</font>

machine and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was from a DEFCON long</font>

712
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:22,620
ago so the weakest link in discussions

713
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:25,950
of security privacy identity is the

714
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:29,370
definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the definition is not</font>

715
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:32,100
what we think so this has created a

716
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:34,919
whole variety of new experiences I have

717
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,990
a son he's in his 40s now checking the

718
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,030
time he's in his 40s back when he was

719
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:42,720
graduating from Northwestern not far

720
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:44,790
away they announced the graduation they

721
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,380
major field of study of the people

coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up for their diploma and they</font>

00:31:53,550 --> 00:32:00,000
laughed they laughed because ad hoc

727
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:02,699
major didn't make sense to them you had

728
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:12,570
two definite<font color="#CCCCCC"> well defined category of</font>

729
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:19,350
domain of understand excuse me yes we're

730
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:21,149
an office on they thought history was

731
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:23,490
history and that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was and math</font>

732
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:24,960
was math and that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was but when</font>

733
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:27,180
my son had done was take a look at the

734
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,980
things he loved to do I got him an<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple</font>

735
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to when he was 12 and he opened it and</font>

736
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,630
started programming and he never<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked</font>

737
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:36,450
back he'd combined studies from a math

738
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:39,540
and cognitive psych and philosophy and

739
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,760
AI and computer science and he

740
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,560
integrated them into a major he called

741
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,160
symbolic system studies which is now

742
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:50,250
major he was a prototype<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what was</font>

743
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:52,200
inevitably to come in other words as the

744
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:55,320
boundaries around not only countries and

745
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:59,580
nation states and individual entities go

746
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:02,399
down and become porous and amorphous but

747
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,570
the boundaries around everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

748
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,950
going down including the

749
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:09,668
maine's of knowledge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding</font>

750
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:12,700
and what he discovered was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> only in</font>

751
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:15,639
a cross-disciplinary way can I begin<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

752
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:18,700
understand what these different areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

753
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:22,269
expertise contribute to a new area of

754
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:24,639
expertise that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> emerging in other</font>

words originality again going back to

00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:30,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nietzsche what is it to see something</font>

757
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,080
that has no name is yet and hence cannot

758
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:34,750
be mentioned although it stares us in

759
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,820
the face the way human beings are it

760
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:40,330
takes a name to make something visible

761
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:43,000
those with originality have for the most

762
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:47,080
part been those who<font color="#CCCCCC"> have also assigned</font>

763
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,580
new names and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> people get a hold of</font>

764
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,129
the name is if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a handle on</font>

765
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:53,320
something real and then it becomes part

766
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:56,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">of their paradigm and we move forward</font>

767
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:58,269
for example when in the 1920s after

768
00:33:56,259 --> 00:34:01,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">world war one had demonstrated the power</font>

of air power we<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin flying here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

770
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:05,679
there and we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> delivering mail by the</font>

771
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:08,199
government and periodically people would

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,659
hop on the plane and ride with mail and

773
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:13,658
they were daring souls in this new

774
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:16,839
technology and they they call them era

knots<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron aughts and the government</font>

00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:22,179

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost to flying those expensive</font>

machines from one place to another but

780
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:30,669
they needed a new name they couldn't

781
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:34,030
call them Aaron<font color="#CCCCCC"> aughts but we have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">astronauts right but most of us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:39,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of ourselves yet as capable of</font>

784
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,530
being an astronaut and going to space in

785
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,639
the same way most human beings in 1920s

786
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,770
couldn't think of themselves as writing

787
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,929
airplanes so they needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give it a</font>

788
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:49,509
name that people could recognize and put

789
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:52,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">themselves into that name and then take</font>

790
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:54,069
it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> as part of their identity and so</font>

791
00:34:52,270 --> 00:35:04,030
what was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name they changed Aaron</font>

792
00:34:54,069 --> 00:35:07,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">ought to anyone airplane passenger they</font>

793
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:08,920
said let's call them passengers and how

794
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:12,310
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are airplane passengers</font>

795
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:15,940
everybody but the name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what made it</font>

796
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:17,710
available so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is becoming a</font>

797
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,280
phenomenon<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's happening faster and</font>

798
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,200
faster

799
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,610
new names need to be assigned in a

800
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,129
meaningful way that integrates with

801
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:26,200
enough of our other knowledge to be able

802
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:28,510
to be in across this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> airy way</font>

803
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:33,040
understood in a way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> gives his power</font>

804
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:37,360
night in 2004 the first president<font color="#E5E5E5"> of MIT</font>

805
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:40,120
who was not just a woman<font color="#E5E5E5"> but had a</font>

806
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,430
background in biology was hired as

807
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:45,160
president of MIT first time it wasn't an

808
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:47,259
engineer she gave a wonderful address

809
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,480
that's now over decade old on

810
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:51,460
cross-disciplinary learning and why it

811
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,590
was essential<font color="#CCCCCC"> and necessary for all</font>

812
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:57,160
students to mastered that discipline

813
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:58,570
more than any other and the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

814
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,759
she<font color="#E5E5E5"> came from bio should have been a</font>

815
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,890
signal that the technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

816
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,930
information communication was now a

817
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:07,480
platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> on which these other domains</font>

818
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:08,950
were resting and also accelerating the

819
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,660
speed at which they worked and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

820
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:13,960
why I start doing talk some years ago on

821
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:16,480
biohacking and did talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people at CIA</font>

822
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,100
who were doing extraordinary innovative

823
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,160
and sometimes scary things with

824
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:24,610
neuroscience because biohacking is the

825
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:26,920
name of the game hacking our identity

826
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:29,230
from the inside out and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

827
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">go into that another talk online that</font>

828
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:33,580
I've done about that but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what i</font>

829
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,680
mean what crisper a wonderful new

830
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:38,080
technology enables us to deal with gene

831
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,460
manipulation that is going to enable us

832
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,830
to do all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so in this</font>

833
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:43,540
country we have constraints ethical and

834
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:45,759
legal to prevent<font color="#E5E5E5"> us from doing certain</font>

00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:53,110
everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be can be done is</font>

00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:55,150
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be done give you an example</font>

839
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:59,050
there are people not<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about head</font>

840
00:36:55,150 --> 00:37:02,830
transplants that's one monkey giving a

841
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:06,460
head to another what they mean it they

842
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:09,400
mean it now here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mouse white mouse</font>

843
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:15,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Whitehead and here is what it looked</font>

844
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:18,460
like after the head transplant it's real

845
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:22,540
picture real<font color="#CCCCCC"> mouse which is the mouse</font>

846
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:24,940
the head or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> body now we have</font>

847
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:26,380
advanced so much that we were able to

848
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:28,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">discern what you would call Mouse</font>

849
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,730
thoughts I mean the neurological pattern

850
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,750
in the brain of this head when it

851

<font color="#E5E5E5">what we found out this is what it was</font>

854
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:48,040
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> right okay so all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the only non true story in</font>

00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:54,340
the speech but it's but it's it's what a

857
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:57,399
lot of us are thinking a lot of the time

858
00:37:54,340 --> 00:38:00,070
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result of finding ourselves with</font>

00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:05,950
seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be coming from a different body</font>

861
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,110
and that's why the proper attitude is

awe and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wonder rather than fear and</font>

second about privacy is a new thing you

didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any privacy there it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't</font>

915
00:40:24,009 --> 00:40:28,299
you know like an American child feels

00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:31,239
like it it was going to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> the social</font>

worker right if you abuse it by not

00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:34,539
letting it have the internet all the

919
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:36,400
time and I remember when my daughter

924
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:48,249
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she said the one thing</font>

925
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:50,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">she wanted was a microwave so she could</font>

926
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:52,839
cook for herself and leave the dishes

927
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:55,089
outside the door for us to take care of

928
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:56,619
so she would never<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to come out and</font>

929
00:40:55,089 --> 00:41:00,640
interact with such a horrible family

930
00:40:56,619 --> 00:41:04,779
those of you have teenagers recognize

931
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,879
the phase it passes but that's that's

932
00:41:04,779 --> 00:41:11,230
the way it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so ended</font>

933
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:14,319
individuality was not a new thing was a

934
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:18,430
new thing as the changes began to take

935
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:21,009
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> in society and the major engine of</font>

936
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:23,230
those changes was the printing press the

937
00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:26,650
printing press was the transformational

938

940
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:33,339
internet has been digital technologies

941
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:38,470
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transformation of our own</font>

942
00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:42,730
damn running through this to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

943
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:45,009
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can quote accurately the</font>

944
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:46,630
printing press was the foundation of the

00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:50,799
Reformation the Scientific Revolution

religious transformation transformation

00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:55,329
of knowledge transformation of nation

948

boundary around them to organize the

950

complexity

951

solving from the speed of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow of</font>

information into and out of and through

953
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,569
the system so you got that the boundary

954
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,090
you need around an organizational

955
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:12,580
structure or any entity has to be one

00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:17,860

<font color="#E5E5E5">flow of information into and out of that</font>

959
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,610
system well simultaneously with the

960
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:24,520
emergence of the printing press came

961
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:25,990
things like rights there was no<font color="#E5E5E5"> such</font>

962
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,630
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> as intellectual property or</font>

963
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:31,209
intellectual property rights there was

964
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:33,370
no such thing as human rights and there

965
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:37,990
was no such thing civil rights until

966
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:40,390
much later individuals were discovered

967
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:42,189
to have them but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop for a</font>

968
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:43,870
moment and look at the word individual

969
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:49,120
how many of you see the Shakespeare play

970
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:52,390
recently anybody here at figures<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

971
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:54,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well shit how many of you know this</font>

972
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:58,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">back up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how many of you know Shakespeare</font>

973
00:42:54,970 --> 00:43:00,939
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's good well I once</font>

974
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,620
referred to hell in a speech at Def Con

975
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:05,800
and one of the youngsters came up and

976
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:07,810
said who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell thinking everybody knew</font>

977
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,970
the robotic hell and now long ago at

978
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:13,180
o'reilly security conference in New York

979
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:15,700
in the fall I caught a Chinatown one of

980
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:19,419
my favorite movies<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's Chinatown Jake</font>

981
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:21,040
it's Chinatown and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

982
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,170
people putting on the conference said

983
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,960
you know most of those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> has never</font>

984
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:28,570
seen that movie<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I love it she said</font>

985
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,760
but a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

986
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:33,730
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think yeah that was</font>

987
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">the 70s that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was many many decades ago</font>

988
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,900
and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the 70s</font>

989
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:41,170
was the Golden Age of of real good

<font color="#CCCCCC">Hollywood films but that's a whole other</font>

991
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:46,300
story why bring up Shakespeare because

992
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:47,650
there's about twenty five percent of the

993
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,180
words if you do go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a Shakespeare play</font>

994
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:51,430
you think you will understand

995
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,870
Elizabethan English this is not Chaucer

996
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:54,940
in Middle English this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not bale</font>

997
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:56,980
wolves and Old English this is

998
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:58,840
Elizabethan English and you think you

999
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,490
understand it pretty well but about

1000
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty-five percent of the words do not</font>

1001
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:04,330
mean what you think they mean their

1002
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:06,880
meanings have changed language<font color="#E5E5E5"> is fluid</font>

1003
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:09,250
and dynamic and and organic

1004
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,130
and Shakespeare used the word individual

1005
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:16,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">but what he meant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by it was indivisible</font>

1006
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:20,710
it was a describing word of<font color="#E5E5E5"> equality of</font>

indivisibility of unitary pneus of unity

upon the part of an object or attribute

1009
00:44:22,509 --> 00:44:27,609
it wasn't for another couple of hundred

00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:29,529
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the OED to trace the meaning</font>

of the word in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a word study that we</font>

1012

discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the word individual</font>

1013
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:38,288
meant a human being an individual as we

<font color="#E5E5E5">think of ourselves as individuals in a</font>

a boundary around the information being

00:51:23,709 --> 00:51:28,390
interrelated in that deep and

1160
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:30,910
foundational way but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we ever see</font>

1161
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:33,670
ourselves as separate that we have

1162
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:36,279
evolved so as to think of ourselves as

1163
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:38,199
separate oh my god<font color="#E5E5E5"> the girl says in the</font>

1164
00:51:36,279 --> 00:51:41,859
back of the t-shirt<font color="#E5E5E5"> he is in love with a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">machine a hacker who fuses symbiotically</font>

1166
00:51:41,859 --> 00:51:46,299
with the machine which becomes an

1167
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:48,400
essential aspect of themselves is more

1168
00:51:46,299 --> 00:51:51,309
than in love with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine there in a</font>

1169
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,039
symbiotic relationship with a cot not

1170
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:55,989
conscious but intelligent entity that is

1171
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:59,289
fueling and feeding their ability to go

1172
00:51:55,989 --> 00:52:02,229
farther and surpass all those who cannot

1173
00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:05,979
engage with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine give you a</font>

1174
00:52:02,229 --> 00:52:08,319
trivial example years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was writing</font>

1175
00:52:05,979 --> 00:52:11,049
about this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait way back a late</font>

1176
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:15,609
80s Early 90s and Wired magazine came

1177
00:52:11,049 --> 00:52:18,670
along and I proposed an article for them

1178
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:20,229
in the early<font color="#E5E5E5"> days I like where the</font>

1179
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:23,259
internet was going to lead society and

1180
00:52:20,229 --> 00:52:25,419
they took I guess it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> five thousand</font>

1181
00:52:23,259 --> 00:52:27,729
word article they used 500 being wired

1182
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:30,339
but that was good and I said can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use</font>

1183
00:52:27,729 --> 00:52:31,808
these other<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4500 words anywhere I'd said</font>

1184
00:52:30,339 --> 00:52:35,140
yeah write another article or use them

1185
00:52:31,809 --> 00:52:37,269
any way you want now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1186
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,920
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to teach English literature back in</font>

1187
00:52:37,269 --> 00:52:41,859
my 20s they're cutting this literature

1188
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:44,619
at the University of Illinois so I kind

1189
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:46,930
of knew how text works and the world in

1190
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:48,430
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wrote stories and sent them</font>

1191
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:50,890
out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote articles and synth amount</font>

1192
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:53,198
was defined by text in other words there

1193
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:55,239
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a book called writers market and it</font>

1194
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:57,759
contained North American markets and

1195
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:59,099
literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the paradigm remodel</font>

1196
00:52:57,759 --> 00:53:01,349
you could not but

1197
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:04,890
live in because there was no other model

1198
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:07,229
and here i am using text in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that old</font>

1199
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,700
paradigm writing for Wired about where

1200
00:53:07,229 --> 00:53:10,769
the internet is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to lead people and</font>

1201
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:13,169
I'm thinking where can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I send the rest</font>

1202
00:53:10,769 --> 00:53:15,598
of these words to<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish them so if</font>

1203
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:18,150
there was nothing like wired anywhere in

1204
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:21,150
America and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the light bulb</font>

1205
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:24,210
went<font color="#CCCCCC"> on thank God for light bulbs and I</font>

1206
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:27,660
said to myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> duh don't just write</font>

1207
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:30,210
about the internet use the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1208
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:33,029
was brand-new then my website was one of

1209
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:35,609
the ones USA Today called a<font color="#E5E5E5"> website of</font>

1210
00:53:33,029 --> 00:53:40,259
the week that's how few there were they

1211
00:53:35,609 --> 00:53:43,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">picked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five a week to to spotlight and</font>

1212
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:45,479
so I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and found</font>

1213
00:53:43,229 --> 00:53:48,239
magazines in<font color="#E5E5E5"> England in south africa in</font>

1214
00:53:45,479 --> 00:53:50,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">australia and canada and began writing</font>

1215
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:53,819
for those places all over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world and</font>

1216
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:57,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">suddenly by engaging with the technology</font>

1217
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:59,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">itself is my point i was shown that</font>

1218
00:53:57,089 --> 00:54:02,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">which I could not see inside the old</font>

1219
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:05,368
paradigm because we can't and once I

1220
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,930
could be drawn by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new paradigm into</font>

1221
00:54:05,369 --> 00:54:09,569
it by having the courage and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will to</font>

1222
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:11,519
engage with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it then I became a global</font>

1223
00:54:09,569 --> 00:54:13,680
figure it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a hotshot thing</font>

1224
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:16,439
everybody these days is a global figure

1225
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,089
I was just early and once your global

1226
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,319
figure I began writing a column code

1227
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:20,999
islands in the clickstream and it was

1228
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:23,969
going to 60 countries in a couple years

1229
00:54:20,999 --> 00:54:25,709
into a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of subscribers and suddenly</font>

1230
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:27,210
that created a platform of credibility

1231
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:30,660
on which the speaking career could be

1232
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:33,180
based if I had not been willing to use

1233
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:35,788
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet to expand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my horizons</font>

1234
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:38,609
dramatically in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that only the</font>

1235
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:43,650
technology itself could disclose then

1236
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:46,979
that never would have happened so when

1237
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:50,999
we have the courage to hack our bodies

1238
00:54:46,979 --> 00:54:54,569
or hack our minds or heck the economic

1239
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:57,629
structure we are allowing ourselves to

1240
00:54:54,569 --> 00:55:00,749
be drawn it into a new paradigm once

1241
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:02,640
upon<font color="#E5E5E5"> a time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd used to be let's see</font>

1242
00:55:00,749 --> 00:55:04,169
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> time it is I'm almost done i'll</font>

1243
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,920
make this a concluding story because

1244
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:10,410
it's like many things it can conclude

1245
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:13,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">ostensibly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i used to be an Episcopal</font>

1246
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:15,310
clergyman that was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time</font>

1247
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:18,220
gar was in the ministry<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 16 years</font>

1248
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:21,130
loved it learned a lot was taught a lot

1249
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:23,200
and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> invited to participate in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1250
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:24,730
hotshot conference called new paradigms

1251
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,350
for clergy leadership was three-year

1252
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:28,210
conference and they brought us together

1253
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:30,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">for 10 days brought in Silicon Valley</font>

1254
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:31,900
people to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all the things they</font>

1255
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:33,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">were doing so that we could adapt those</font>

1256
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:38,410
structures for the paradigms the

1257
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:39,820
Episcopal Church and rethink it so we're

1258
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:40,899
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new paradigms</font>

1259
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,250
what's the people in that room were

1260
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:47,110
white males most of them were<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their</font>

1261
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:48,610
40s 50s typically you know and they were

1262
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:50,650
sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> there second year buzzing about</font>

1263
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:53,890
how can we change the paradigm when a

1264
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:55,300
light bulb<font color="#CCCCCC"> went on and I said I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1265
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:58,810
realized what we have to do to change

1266
00:55:55,300 --> 00:56:02,860
the paradigm and they said what and I

1267
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:05,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">said we have to leave look at real quiet</font>

1268
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:08,560
and then about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 seconds later</font>

1269
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:11,560
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> began talking again as if I</font>

1270
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:13,330
had never said anything and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took a</font>

1271
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:16,810
woman to come up at the break<font color="#CCCCCC"> a woman</font>

1272
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:18,130
was a staff a staff be a woman to sit

1273
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:19,509
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the edge and watch what was</font>

1274
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:21,400
happening and say when you speak from

1275
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:24,940
that depth of reality they cannot hear

1276
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:27,700
you but I could not ever forget what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1277
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:29,230
heard myself say I had to prepare it

1278
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:33,279
properly<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that I left in the way I</font>

1279
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:35,260
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to but for 23 and a half years</font>

1280
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,390
after leading the ordained ministry

1281
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:39,340
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the hotshot jobs they</font>

1282
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:41,080
were offering I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to explore</font>

1283
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:43,210
this world the way that never would have

1284
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:45,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">been possible that I stayed within that</font>

1285
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:48,460
paradigm instead I've transcended the

1286
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:51,700
structures well I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1287
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:55,000
religious talk leaving the old paradigm

1288
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:57,100
instantiates the new paradigm because

1289
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,650
what I saw was that the hotshot leaders

1290
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:02,170
were Gorbachev they were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to both</font>

1291
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:04,150
preserve the revolution and lead a

1292
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:07,090
revolution and you can't do both and

1293
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:09,280
there was no way having reached

1294
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:12,250
leadership positions in the church or

1295
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,920
any organization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you cannot have</font>

1296
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:17,320
not internalized the structures by which

1297
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:19,930
you have reached those levels and you

1298
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">have become that as Timothy Leary said</font>

1299
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:24,879

00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:57,980
an episode over Washington DC where

there were so many UFOs over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Capitol</font>

still treated as news which was part of

1339
00:59:09,319 --> 00:59:14,509
the paradigm of distributing truth in

1340
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:17,690
those days and they decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> soon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

because it was so so harming so

1345

<font color="#E5E5E5">concerns that were genuine and real but</font>

1350
