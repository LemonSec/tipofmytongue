<font color="#CCCCCC">people being introduced I'll introduce</font>

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,068
myself the next speaker will be Phil

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,670
rock away from the University of

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:16,619
California Davis please Phil thanks for

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:18,359
that generous introduction so yeah so I

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,619
have a kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of long talk so I want to</font>

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lose too much</font>

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,490
time but you all look so far away<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you</font>

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,060
think you could humor me by like coming

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:38,370
up Jenny I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> add I you thank you</font>

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:39,989
thank you so as you like so a lot of

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:46,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">people seem to think that cryptography</font>

13
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:48,599
is is really this amazing apparatus I i

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,870
sense even in cryptographic discourse

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,879
these days a kind of utopian vision that

16
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,010
if we just mangle bits in the right way

17
00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,449
then heaven on<font color="#E5E5E5"> earth will be here</font>

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:02,670
something like this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm often the</font>

19
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,319
beneficiary of this I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">know when I identify myself as a</font>

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,939
cryptographer then I get a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,610
stature from this that maybe isn't

23
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:14,250
particularly deserved and what's odd in

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,640
some ways is that this stature is is

25
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,200
neared in both academia and in popular

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,390
culture which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of unheard of that</font>

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,350
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree on anything but in academia</font>

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:28,290
cryptography is definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> a well-loved</font>

29
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,240
academic discipline you know fully<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,979
of 63 Turing Award winners or

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,158
cryptographers this is amazing because

32
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,408
well it's not just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

33
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,049
cryptographers don't comprised of

34
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,119
academic researchers in computer science

35
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,490
photographers don't comprise one percent

of academic researchers in computer

37
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,649
science so this is way out of proportion

38
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,290
and then you know in you know depictions

39
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,140
of cryptography in film and in books

40
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,040
well I can't complain I don't know

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,950
cryptographers or the brilliant and

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,350
handsome mathematicians that the country

43
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,180

cryptography it's totally possible so

58
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:52,620
yeah I I have to disappoint galcon

sniper<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell you that cryptography</font>

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:59,580
will not improve your memory in any

62
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:06,480
there's you know lots of claims about

63
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,540
what cryptography can do that clearly

64
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,060
are you know within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> within the realm</font>

65
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,950
of its capacities and there are lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

66
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,989
claims about wealth cryptography can do

67

that are clearly outside the realm of

its<font color="#E5E5E5"> capacity but there's also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> affair a</font>

69
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,820
fairly large<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray space where I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

70
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:28,200
there's this contested territory of

71
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:30,450
whether cryptography is somehow up to

72
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,130
the task and the problem i'm really

73
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,869
interested in and have been interested

74
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,780
in for a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

75
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:39,209
contested space if whether cryptography

76
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,310
can actually be a democratizing kind of

77
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:44,220
technology whether in particular

78
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,200
democracy who cryptography holds

79
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,560
potential for staving off

80
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,630
authoritarianism and I think my interest

81
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:59,100
in authoritarianism should be kind of

82
00:03:51,630 --> 00:04:01,200
obvious so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I don't think we</font>

83
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,560
have to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to find the signs of</font>

84
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,160
of emerging authoritarianism in

85
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,810
contemporary society and if you don't

86
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,280
buy this political narrative I won't

87
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,880
convince you in the next minute anyway

88
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,120
but I i think the signs are ostensible

89
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,459
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should I should make clear that</font>

90
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,250
the rise of authoritarianism

91
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,500
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> US political culture doesn't begin</font>

92
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,930
with Donald Trump one can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the roots</font>

93
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:34,000
for this going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back several years now</font>

94
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:36,940
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> many would say that the political</font>

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,389
power of the new wave of

96
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:43,000
authoritarianism is a consequence of the

97
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:46,449
of what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the feathering strategy</font>

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,759
this idea in the late 1960s that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

99
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:51,460
Republican Party would court wipe

southern voters by kind of playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tenets that ring strongly</font>

true for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those with authoritarian</font>

103
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:04,359
tendencies so I've been brandishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

104
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,429
word authoritarianism around for a bit

105
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,900
without actually specifying what I mean

106
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:15,039
so authoritarianism he is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> worldview</font>

107
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:17,830
rooted in personality rooted in in human

108
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,830
psychology that values order and

109
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:24,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">authority and additionally distrust</font>

110
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:26,560
outsiders and social change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and among</font>

111
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,030
its tenants or this loyal acceptance of

112
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,150
authority a willingness to accept

113
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:34,150
established hierarchies a strong

114
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:37,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">aversion to ambiguity a clear desire for</font>

115
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,969
answers the pairing of these comprise

116
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:43,180
what psychologists sometimes call a need

117
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:46,900
for cognitive closure a desire for

118
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:50,110
traditionalism strong notions of group

119
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:53,739
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in my group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and who is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> outside</font>

120
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:56,380
this group perhaps strangely a tendency

121
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:00,550
towards feelings of disgust which maybe

122
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:02,020
don't seem natural but empirically are

123
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,500
linked to the rest of these categories

124
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:09,698
<font color="#E5E5E5">is nicely demonstrated in a plls article</font>

125
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:12,340
a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago fear fear seems to be a</font>

126
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:14,229
hallmark of authoritarianism and in fact

127
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,590
modern theories of authoritarianism

128
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:21,460
suggest that non authoritarians will in

129
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:24,039
fact act like authoritarians when when

130
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,229
pushed especially by external fears by

131
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:27,750
fears of someone they recognized as an

132
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:30,510
outsider

133
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">high confidence in one's beliefs that is</font>

134
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,980
a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of growth minded us and finally a</font>

135
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:39,869
tendency to ascribe a single cause to

136
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:42,360
complex problems so I might comment that

137
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,160
while authoritarianism is quite a loaded

138
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,870
term it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> impossible to say this word</font>

139
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,850
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> people saying like that's not me</font>

140
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:52,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">psychologists who study this well they</font>

141
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,930
failed to find an alternative word but

142
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,550
they try not to view this as in a kind

143
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,430
of pejorative manner this is simply a

144
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,680
cluster of personality characteristics

145

authoritarianism got off to a really

00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:13,530
rocky start in the academic literature

148
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:16,680
it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> begins just before World War</font>

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:29,340
continues just after the war in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1950</font>

153
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,750
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> famous book by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> adorno and other</font>

154
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,960
is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the authoritarian personality</font>

155
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:38,100
but as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was saying the field kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

156
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:44,190
existed in a kind of intellectual

157
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:48,210
no-man's land not really getting a

158
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:50,430
decent reputation in academia in part

159
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,109
because of fundamental problems in

160
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,960
instrumentation in trying to measure

161
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,330
authoritarianism and the instruments

162
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,549
that originally had been used would ask

163
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,530
political questions and then try and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

164
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,540
look it's correlated with these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

165
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:06,570
political out views and outcomes and

166
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:11,220
that didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really make sense so finally</font>

167
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:14,520
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the early 1990s and then popularized</font>

169
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,180
of assessing authoritarianism was found

170
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:21,750
that severed it from its political

171
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:24,720
context and the clever idea was to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

172
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,400
simple questions about<font color="#CCCCCC"> child-rearing as</font>

173
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,750
a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of surrogate to understand</font>

174
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:33,079
authoritarianism and well why don't you

175
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,000
take the test<font color="#E5E5E5"> for yourself so</font>

176
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,040
you can scribble it down or mentally

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,280
scribble it which is more important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a child to have a independence be</font>

179
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,770

important for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a child to have a</font>

181
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:50,930
obedience the self-reliance which is

00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:54,650
more important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a child to have a</font>

183
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:56,420
curiosity be good manners all of these

184
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,459
responses are alphabetical so don't try

185
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">and do now with it which is more</font>

188
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,400
so too for this test to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself a</font>

189
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:13,760
quarter point for each of the indicated

190
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:20,390
answers be a BB so you'll have a score

191
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:22,370
now of 0 to 1 and if your score is three

192
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,040
quarters<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 1 congratulations you're an</font>

your non authoritarian if you're a half

195
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:33,620
I guess you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there in the middle</font>

196
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:35,840
and this instrument perhaps surprisingly

197
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:39,080
has been shown to their remarkable

198
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,060
correlation with much longer instruments

199
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,520
that try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assess much more directly</font>

201
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:51,050

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,140
out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a wonderful predictor for</font>

from supporting Donald Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you believe that data will</font>

it's not encrypted then in some sense

310
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:05,470

to the conclusion that these

capabilities will almost certainly be

337
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:19,900
exploited in order to expand

339
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:26,170
surveillance both benefits authoritarian

340

leaders and then they in turn push for

00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,599
further expansions in surveillance and

342
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:34,300
surveillance capabilities if this is the

<font color="#CCCCCC">roadmap then how is cryptography going</font>

344
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,880
to somehow come to interfere with it

345
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:41,530
well the most obvious manner is that

346
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,290
cryptography will create a kind of

347
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,839
alternative technological landscape in

348
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,790
which

349
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,310
the crypto actually obstructs our

350
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,829
surveillance capabilities it will

351
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:53,810
obstruct it by ensuring that he who

352
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,850
gathers information will gather nothing

353
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:59,300
of any utility nothing but meaningless

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,750
authoritarianism and you might call this

the I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know strong program of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that crypto would create new entirely</font>

wishes one that finally came into

369
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:45,290
fruition in a practical way with Bitcoin

370
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:51,140
and one could certainly imagine that

00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:53,840
Bitcoin used pervasively is such a new

improved capacities for<font color="#CCCCCC"> whistleblowing</font>

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:16,010
in particular web sites like WikiLeaks

379
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:19,100
so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this program</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked out has</font>

380
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:21,740
crypto actually done much to obstruct

381
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,770
surveillance capabilities and have

382
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:27,320
crypto led to<font color="#E5E5E5"> entirely new liberties</font>

383
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:30,650
which counter authoritarian tendencies

384
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,649
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the answer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to both of these</font>

385
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:38,630
is clearly know that in particular

00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:40,790
crypto were to genuinely be obstructing

387
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:44,630
surveillance capabilities would be

388
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:46,129
posing a risk to to both capital and the

389
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,860
state that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really wouldn't find</font>

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:53,390
tolerable and we've never<font color="#CCCCCC"> really had</font>

significant quantities of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data being</font>

392
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:58,340
pulled out of the realm of surveillance

393
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,370
no perhaps until quite

394
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think you can say that the</font>

398
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:13,070
nothing has touched the metadata story

as for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new liberties will there too</font>

400
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:18,080
I think the situation is disappointing

401
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:20,179
if one was hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> whistle blowing</font>

402
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,809
sites like WikiLeaks would lead to

00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:26,179
expanded Democratic potential I think

404
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:29,600
the story is quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> mixed as to whether</font>

405
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:33,440
in the end the tendency<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one that is</font>

favoring<font color="#CCCCCC"> Democratic movements or one</font>

407
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:41,390
that's actually oppositional to it I

408
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:43,639
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> another explanation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:53,570
simply on the architecture of encryption

so<font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption whether it's in the</font>

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,360
well first the basic mathematics of hard

418
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,549
functions that we really believe it's

419
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,860
possible to create the super polynomial

420
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:14,510
even exponential differences in the

amount of efforts that are neat the

422

decrypt under an unknown key furthermore

anything exotic is easy to to set up

496

this is always the advertised advantage

497
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:41,300
of identity based encryption that it

498
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,100
minimizes the key distribution problem

510
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:15,409
in fact it's a particularly problematic

511
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:19,040
form of key escrow because this public

512

513
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,389

515
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:29,540

all<font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've drawn here now</font>

00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:15,710
is that I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow overcome</font>

00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,540
the tyranny of cloud computing by

<font color="#E5E5E5">sticking only encrypted data in the</font>

534
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:29,600
so what could<font color="#E5E5E5"> go wrong here</font>

535
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:32,090
when I want the the cloud to do some

536
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,789
computation on my data I'll send it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:42,499
really want to to somehow encrypt ass as

00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:46,159
well and the cloud by the magic of fhe

541
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:49,789
is going to send me back the encryption

00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:31,399

compare the expenditures in companies

642

are almost entirely here and the

conference now there's very little that

goes that goes on there in truth still

648
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:07,520
continuing in this explanation for how

649
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:11,930
why optimism might be might be realistic

650
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:15,680
I might point to the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of discourse</font>

651
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:17,540
suggested by Lawrence Lessig in his code

00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,390
is law kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> troops so he's not</font>

653
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:23,420
referring strictly to software here but

654
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:26,000
to the idea that how we architect our

655
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:28,010
systems the software the hardware the

656
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,220
complete architecture of our computing

657
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:33,170
systems defines that which we can do on

658
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:35,480
them it defines the realm of what's

659
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:37,580
visible it sets where we have the

660
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,800
ability to regulate and in this manner

661
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:44,210
it operates very much like the law

662
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:46,100
regulating in an elegant manner similar

663
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:48,830
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ideas were suggested in the</font>

00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:56,800
this is again potentially quite useful

667
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:59,439
it just says if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

673
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:17,350
very wrong and that we will get things

674
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,960
wrong if power is the one who determines

675
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:21,790
the shape of this architecture and I'm

676
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,740
afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that very much is what have</font>

680
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:33,460
days is mostly determined by you know

681
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:35,560
standardization committees and political

682
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,930
processes which are dominated by

683
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:41,050
fundamentally illiberal companies and

684
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:44,080
governments so if somehow one imagines

as if by magic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> voices of civil</font>

00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:53,139
determine the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most democratic</font>

00:32:53,140 --> 00:33:04,900
think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my Eve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe another</font>

691
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:13,540
democratizing technology stems from the

claim<font color="#CCCCCC"> that lots of cryptographers are</font>

693

super smart and and they'll save us

694
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:26,380
again this kind of echoes back to the

695
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:29,770
the depiction of cryptography in in the

696
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:31,930
films and<font color="#E5E5E5"> books on the subject but my</font>

697
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:34,930
own observation is a cryptographer is

698
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:37,750
that yeah lots of cryptographers really

699
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:40,270
are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart and they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very smart in</font>

700
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:42,040
the one thing that they work on that

701
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:44,710
there doesn't necessarily seem to be any

702
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,330
spillover that you know cryptographers

703
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:48,940
any more than any other set of

704
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:53,530
individuals are particularly attuned to

705
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:56,920
the political<font color="#E5E5E5"> and social consequences of</font>

706
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:59,470
what they construct and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> broadly i</font>

707
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,510
would say that technologists across the

708
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:03,760
spectrum tend to be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

709
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:06,520
tone-deaf these days too

710
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:10,418
the social consequences of the

711
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:12,880
technological work that they do most

712
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:14,739
work by most cryptographers is really

713
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:17,620
has nothing to do with privacy as I've

714
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:19,509
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> before and we should add to all of</font>

715
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,270
this the fact that the crypto community

716
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:23,770
in any case is extremely tiny I

717
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,960
mentioned this at the very beginning

718
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:28,179
there are fewer than a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

719
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the world who have published as many</font>

720
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:34,570
as three papers in an IAC are sponsored

721
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:36,939
conference or workshop three papers is a

722
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:39,820
very low bar for what one would take to

723
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:42,909
be considered a cryptographer you know

724
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,919
so we're looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fields that is you</font>

725
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:47,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">know an order of magnitude or more</font>

726
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:52,960
smaller than you know fields like

727
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:59,020
computer graphics or you know natural

728
00:34:52,960 --> 00:35:02,320
language processing and the truth is

729
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:04,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that most of my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> colleagues really could</font>

730
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">not care less about mass surveillance</font>

731
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:09,370
this was true before Snowden published

732
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:12,970
and I really hope that Snowden would be

733
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:15,970
kind of a sea change in setting our

734
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:19,540
priorities it hasn't worked out that way

735
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:22,000
simply scanning all I ACR conference

736
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:24,640
proceedings the thousands of pages for

737
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,880
the word surveillance will reveal that

738
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:31,870

even from the point of view of a

was it in this context cryptographers

were more than happy to raise their hand

840

and say yes in fact that resolution was

will<font color="#E5E5E5"> win and the bad guys are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very bad</font>

885
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:33,800
there are terrorists and child molesters

886
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:35,130
and drug kingpins and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just can't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">allow this to</font>

888
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:43,560
this is the framing some people call the

00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:45,180
going dark framing or the law

890
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:48,960
enforcement framing and it's nicely

891
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:53,250
enunciated by by James Comey the FBI

895
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:05,670
bullshit and that much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> realistic</font>

896
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:07,770
framing what one might call the

00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:10,230
surveillance studies framing or the

898
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:12,210
Golden Age of surveillance framing says

900
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:16,830
working but surveillance is not some

00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:18,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of tool for confronting terrorists</font>

902
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:20,490
but it's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an instrument</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

903
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,799
power and the terrorism is little more

00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:24,930
than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover for action which we have</font>

905
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,620
found to be so useful where the power

906
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:30,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">has and that technology is in fact</font>

907
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:32,970
changing this landscape but it's not

changing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it by helping privacy at all</font>

909
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:38,970
the technological changes are working to

910
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:41,010
make surveillance much cheaper in fact

911
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:43,439
they're making the incremental cost of

912
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:46,830
surveilling just one more individual

913
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:49,230
essentially zero and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of</font>

917
00:43:54,180 --> 00:44:00,810
the surveillance is closely tied to

918
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:04,020
cyber war and assassinations and it is

919
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:06,299
not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible to disentangle what</font>

920
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:09,750
we're doing is a society domestically

921
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:13,920
with our intense for using surveillance

922
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:17,280
internationally and in conflicts the

923
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,160
privacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and security are actually quite</font>

924
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,310
rarely in conflict that by and large

925
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:27,210
privacy supports security and that the

two<font color="#CCCCCC"> work together quite well furthermore</font>

927
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:32,880
but a world in which surveillance has

become routine<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes and ubiquitous that</font>

929
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,160
we all suffer in very severe ways that

people become conforming they become

931
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:44,009
fearful they become boring and the

932
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:46,200
surveillance stifles dissent that we

933
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:47,950
won't have any possibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

in a realm in which surveillance is

936
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:56,560
effectively administered on

937
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:59,078

938
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,750
add that the cost of surveillance are

not borne equally across society that in

940

surveillance surveillance is being used

945
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:29,319
for two principal goods those goods are

946
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:34,720
fighting terrorism and selling you lots

947

framing I think we're kind of in trouble

949
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:42,578
and I think it's not very accurate about

950
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:45,940
what the real purposes of surveillance

951

actually are the ambitions are actually

<font color="#CCCCCC">that no matter what we do as a society</font>

1030
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:19,460
the technology is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to somehow make</font>

1031
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:21,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">it right then you don't adequately</font>

1032
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,390
direct that technology and you get the

1033
00:49:21,769 --> 00:49:26,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of world that we're creating right</font>

1034
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:28,609
now I think a much more realistic

1035
00:49:26,479 --> 00:49:30,379
assessment of where we are is this the

1036
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:32,989
computer science really is marking

1037
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:35,420
ethical changes in human history but

1038
00:49:32,989 --> 00:49:38,390
many of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes actually threaten</font>

1039
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:42,079
human values and even human existence

1040
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:44,420
and that it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

1041
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,400
for mankind to give somehow get above

1042
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:49,369
around this bump and it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a lot</font>

1043
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:55,309
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and wisdom and luck to survive</font>

1044
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:57,920
these threats I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time to talk</font>

1045
00:49:55,309 --> 00:50:02,749
about all of the thoughts I had in

1046
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:07,460
connection with the interaction between

1047
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:09,680
cryptography and authoritarianism I put

1048
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:11,630
a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of summary here including lots of</font>

1049
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,160
things I didn't get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss and I'll</font>

1050
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:21,769
just close out with that on though on

1051
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:41,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">the board all right I think I do have</font>

1052
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:43,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">time for a few questions if you like so</font>

1053
00:50:41,509 --> 00:50:46,279
the question refers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the extent to</font>

1054
00:50:43,339 --> 00:50:50,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">which the recent congressional decision</font>

1055
00:50:46,279 --> 00:50:53,029
to to overturn<font color="#E5E5E5"> Obama air privacy rules</font>

1056
00:50:50,479 --> 00:50:54,499
with respect to isps I think it's just

1057
00:50:53,029 --> 00:50:59,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">more of the same that we've seen a</font>

1058
00:50:54,499 --> 00:51:03,879
steady erosion of of privacy rights and

1059
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,880
this one was quite expected and

1060
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:17,810
yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's a problem please</font>

1061
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:19,940
storing things encrypted in the cloud is

1062
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:24,080
perfectly feasible that's feasible today

1063
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:26,030
but in fully homomorphic encryption you

1064
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,470
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to keep things encrypted</font>

1065
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:29,690
in the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> you then want the cloud to</font>

1066
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:31,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">do all your computation for you without</font>

1067
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:34,460
understanding anything about that which

1068
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:36,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's computing and that's asking for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1069
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:38,990
lot technologically we can achieve

1070
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:41,569
something close to it much more

1071
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:45,140
realistically using a concept called

1072
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:48,170
secure computation or a multi-party

1073
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:50,150
computation the model is a little bit

1074
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:53,660
different but it achieves basically the

1075
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:56,090
same end of carrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> out computations in</font>

1076
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:58,670
a manner in which individual holders of

1077
00:51:56,090 --> 00:52:00,830
data don't understand the nature of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1078
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:04,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">computation that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're jointly</font>

1079
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:07,009
accomplishing even then and i would say

1080
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:10,250
that secure computation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

1081
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:12,560
problems has become quite practical even

1082
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:15,530
then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see us moving in directions</font>

1083
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:18,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">in which secure computation multi-party</font>

1084
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:20,930
computation is becoming is becoming more

1085
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:22,520
important or ubiquitous and in part i

1086
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:26,240
think the incentive structures are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1087
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:28,220
wrong one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know the cloud</font>

1088
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,759
provider really wants to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it</font>

1089
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:33,890
can do is know your data because that's

1090
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:38,270
part of the the model for its

1091
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:40,400
monetization so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not hopeful that</font>

1092
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:44,810
even if we could flip a switch and

1093
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:47,480
somehow have the complexity problems

1094
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:52,130
solved even then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1095
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:54,470
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a world in which computation</font>

1096
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:57,950
in the clouds private computation in the

1097
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:59,480
clouds became ubiquitous and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would</font>

1098
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:01,100
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> add that there's a</font>

1099
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,610
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of irony in all of this because</font>

1100
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:07,100
storage has become really cheap<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

1101
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:08,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need the cloud anymore for storing</font>

1102
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:11,360
the kind of quantities of data that

1103
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,460
individual end users are wanting to

1104
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:17,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">store why are you all sticking your</font>

stuff in you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gmail in a Google</font>

1106
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:22,660
cloud you could in principle have this

1107
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:24,399
you know working<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the same manner as</font>

an answering machine in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your home you</font>

1109
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,860
can back it up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mom's answering</font>

distributed cheap appliance that

1112
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:37,990
provided your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> local cloud you get</font>

1113
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:41,470
essentially all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the advantages of</font>

1114
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:45,339
cloud storage namely you know a shared

1115
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:48,759
common view of the state and transparent

1116
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:52,840
backup but without having given away the

1117
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:55,000
the content itself to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> sum to this</font>

1118
00:53:52,840 --> 00:54:01,780
provider which represents a major shift

1119
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:02,920
in power actually I'll take maybe one

1120
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:19,870
more and then I better leave room for

1121
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:22,000
the next speaker please the question is

1122
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:25,779
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really were able to shift power</font>

1123
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,060
successfully to the week like what would

1124
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:30,490
happen politically and I think we would

1125
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:34,210
see major opposition I think the moment

1126
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:38,200
one really was effective at keeping data

1127
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:40,840
from Facebook and Google the moment one

1128
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:43,629
was truly effective at hiding metadata

1129
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:46,780
content associated telephony there'd be

1130
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:51,010
immediate and strong pushback in our

1131
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:52,450
political process I better wrap up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1132
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:56,250
them but I'll be around if people would

1133
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:56,250
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to chat with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me anymore thanks</font>
