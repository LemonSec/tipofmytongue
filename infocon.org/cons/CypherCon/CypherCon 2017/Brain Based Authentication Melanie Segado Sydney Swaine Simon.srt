1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
uh so I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> started yeah cool so hi</font>

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:11,639
everyone my name is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sitting swing</font>

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,259
timing I'm with neuro tech x melanie was

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">supposed to be here as well today but</font>

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,460
unfortunately she had to stay back in

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,080
montreal neuropsych<font color="#E5E5E5"> x were a</font>

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,910
not-for-profit organization which is

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially about community building and</font>

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,330
promotion around neuro technology and

10
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:25,979
specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing that I'm very</font>

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">much interested in is an accessible</font>

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,330
neural technology so some of the things

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we like to do is we like to network</font>

14
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,019
we like to teach we like to build

15
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,510
different types of open source projects

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,430
so we have a relatively active github

17
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,980
and we just want to kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> grow</font>

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">together we have different chapters</font>

19
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,519
across the world so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have about 18</font>

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,769
chapters worldwide most of them in north

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,070
america and europe but if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever</font>

22
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,660
in any of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> locations you know feel</font>

23
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,770
free to look us up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get connected</font>

24
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:58,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">with your local</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> community so the world</font>

25
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,780
weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna start the talk is just the</font>

26
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,120
kind of we can we mentioned what neurol

27
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,890
technology as as i was talking at their

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,340
booth downstairs at the biohacking boo

29
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,119
what came across is that some of some

30
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,409
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,380
interpretations as to what neural

32
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,520
technology represents and so you can

33
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,380
kind of see<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the screen here</font>

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,880
assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of the classical ones</font>

35
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,080
that you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its or so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

36
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,929
you're thinking about neural technology

37
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,259
so on the top left you have an MRI

38
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,850
machine on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top right you have a tDCS</font>

39
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,479
transcranial direct current stimulation

40
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,979
coincidentally this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a tDCS and</font>

41
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,110
so we're actually you have these T&CS

42
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,030
badges at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biohacking village and if</font>

43
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,700
i press this<font color="#E5E5E5"> little button right here</font>

44
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm actually creating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> phosphines</font>

45
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,470
artificial light in my eyes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

46
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,210
current is running across the optic

47
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,090
nerve and it's clean this artificial

48
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,740
like to be present in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of me you</font>

49
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,270
have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like EG or electronics or</font>

50
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,220
paragraph<font color="#CCCCCC"> ii which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is essentially at</font>

51
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,329
voltmeter for your brain and then you

52
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,850
know things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like TMS transcranial</font>

53
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,939
magnetic stimulation which is a big

54
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:05,399
magnet to induce your neurons to fire

55
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:10,378
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> i also like to do stupid things like</font>

56
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,080
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> play I'm tell us</font>

57
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:14,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">what</font>

58
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:17,650
be happy here is so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RFID</font>

59
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:21,340
and I've seen implants<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well so here's</font>

60
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:24,070
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the implants to be able to get</font>

61
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:28,240
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> work so what you're supposed to be</font>

62
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:33,310
seeing here is being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to access oh</font>

63
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,300
there you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I just click on it so</font>

64
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,690
I'm just kind of showing what the door

65
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:40,900
is locked put my hand over it and now

66
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:43,840
you can get magic and I have another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

67
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,780
as well over here which is an MSD

68
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,150
implant and I just do this more for

69
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,300
party tricks just because people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

70
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,940
still common pressed by this but yeah so

71
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,050
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go reason why I'm here to talk</font>

72
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,329
today is about brain based

73
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,890
authentication I'm assuming most of you

74
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,570
are familiar with what a biometric is

75
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,208
and what biometric authentication is

76
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:06,670
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just using some form of</font>

77
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:08,410
bio signal to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this as an</font>

78
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,359
identifier I could be things like

79
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,700
physical traits you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like your blood</font>

80
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,350
vessels your facial features or your

81
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,780
fingerprint or<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could be more</font>

82
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,269
behavioral like the way that you walk or

83
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,880
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you type usually think</font>

84
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:23,080
about biometric and there are seven

85
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,690
factors that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be considering</font>

86
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,900
run selecting one essentially thinking

87
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,760
about universality so does the target

88
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,430
population that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify</font>

89
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,230
have it is it something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's unique</font>

90
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,000
for each individual is it something that

91
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,250
remains permanent with those individuals

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,310
is it something that you can measure how

93
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">well can you does it perform as a</font>

94
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,750
biometric so can you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a very</font>

95
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:49,239
robust fashion there is something that

96
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,940
people are going to accepting we use as

97
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,430
a biometric and the more important one

98
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,769
is it something that can easily assume

99
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,650
that or faker kind of just circumvented

100
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:01,360
so the realm of brain biometrics has

101
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,610
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing in popularity in the past</font>

102
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,500
five years or so with about 100

103
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,450
publications been released there's this

104
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,080
really active guy in early that's been

105
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,109
raining

106
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,750
so i'll give you have been interested in

107
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,989
some of his research it became more the

108
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,610
popular thing in 2012 as there was a

109
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:20,950
plant that was done as part of the human

110
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:23,470
connecting project which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> working at</font>

111
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,810
MRI scans based on different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

112
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,330
pests and see if they can use that as a

113
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:31,630
method of identification so from the

114
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:34,780
picture here you can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one has</font>

115
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,850
a point<font color="#CCCCCC"> 99 level of identification</font>

116
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,530
that's just means resting state so

117
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,300
looking at the recipe<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially just a</font>

118
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,780
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> standing still and not doing</font>

119
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,340
anything for two minutes but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

120
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,750
need an MRI to do brain based

121
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,359
authentication we could actually do with

122
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,040
much cheaper technology in the past<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

123
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,380
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's been kind of a</font>

124
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,750
revolution within the realm of<font color="#CCCCCC"> oil</font>

125
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology where it was you know</font>

00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,230
primarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> complex like this</font>

127
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,270
before you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much in a research</font>

128
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,130
setting and you know you have these

129
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,200
massive wires that becoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious EEG</font>

130

cap but nearly enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> form factors in</font>

131
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,520
class and designs that are relatively

132
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,050
cheap cheap as when your phone is about

133
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">a hundred bucks us if you make it</font>

134
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,280
yourself you can potentially get a

135
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,900
cheaper but that depends on where you

136
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,969
get your parts but you're usually

137
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,419
looking between let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> two hundred</font>

138
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,230
six or seven hundred dollars the only

thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you couldn't have to</font>

140
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:28,390
understand before going into the how you

can use the brain into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

people<font color="#CCCCCC"> rather than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about I said I'll</font>

148
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,280
gonna be<font color="#CCCCCC"> one detail about this</font>

149
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:48,040
essentially what<font color="#E5E5E5"> a DCI is it follows</font>

150
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,780
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of elegant so at some point of</font>

151
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,250
technology is interfacing into the ring

152
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,140
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then eventually kind of creates this</font>

153
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,790
feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> loop which they can influence</font>

154
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,460
of an activity so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will change it</font>

155
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:00,220
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> classification of that</font>

156
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,690
mental state so first it starts off with

157
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,700
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> generation of the daily activity</font>

158
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,130
then you have to acquire that signals

159
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,539
from the brain you have to digitize it

160
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,430
you have to get the features of the

161
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,250
signal that you're acquiring you have to

162
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:14,260
build a classifier take that class apart

163
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,200
and then put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that into a feedback device</font>

164
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,880
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about brain activity</font>

165
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,560
essentially when we're talking with

166
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">activity they're all interested in</font>

167
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,410
looking at which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what EGS essentially</font>

168
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,620
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> capture the activity with an EEG</font>

169
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,420
when there's enough neurons<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fire in</font>

170
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,310
the automatic sense and collectively

171
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,220
they're generally just smell amount of

172
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,360
electronegativity the humane types of

173
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,240
brain activity that you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

174
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,180
event-related potentials and our fourth

175
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,220
hypothesis and there are solutions no

176
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,990
oscillations are essentially rhythmic

177
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,150
patterns of reactivity that naturally

178
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,920
occur within the brain so Elaine

179
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">intuitive quite often is brain waves</font>

180
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,880
this is essentially what a neural

181
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,990
oscillation is so you kind of see two

182
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,700
examples of one what kind of like the

183
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,560
raw EG activity would look like when

184
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,420
you're awake versus when you're asleep

185
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,810
we could kind of see there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

186
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:11,600
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between you two here's me</font>

187
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,910
being on kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like more of a live</font>

188
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,440
example here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I close my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eyes and I</font>

189
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,390
don't know how easy it is to see but you

190
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">can kind of see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a change in the</font>

191
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:22,430
activity that's being produced the other

192
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,160
one is event-related potentials

193
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:28,790
essentially the way to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ERP</font>

194
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:32,270
is when you presented a stimuli usually

195
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:34,400
between maybe 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 7 30 milliseconds</font>

196
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,919
later you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a change in</font>

197
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:42,049
potential value would occur within the

198
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:43,700
brain<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so for example on the bottom</font>

199
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,920
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> graph or so actually the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

200
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,500
here what this is is a p3 of the

201
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:52,250
dispeller so the individual is looking

202
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:54,080
on a specific letter and it's one the

203
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:58,580
letter finally flashes it's going to

204
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,380
create 8300 response so flashing like

205
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,450
the courage 300 milliseconds later

206
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,610
there's a potential positive potential

207
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:07,550
change other crews and on the bottom

208
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:10,520
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> they Tennessee how you kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

209
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,950
call them so p100 positive potential

210
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,620
change at the 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds so the graph is</font>

211
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:18,830
inverted<font color="#CCCCCC"> y value is in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first so it's all</font>

212
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:22,160
positive values below the<font color="#E5E5E5"> x-axis but</font>

213
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,419
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> basic idea this is kind of</font>

214
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,430
like another way that you can kind of

215
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,230
visualize it so eventually going to see

216
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,880
let's wrap the peaks that you saw there

217
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,110
there was this on the red line there's

218
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,799
just very big peak of activity occurred

219
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,000
out of North once so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

220
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,059
couldn't understand how you acquire

221
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,030
brain activity or what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they look like</font>

222
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:43,650
you know not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to require the signal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

223
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,199
the technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is most commonly</font>

224
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:49,260
used as a junior electroencephalography

225
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,690
you can think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as a voltmeter for</font>

226
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,910
being so it's just measuring the changes

227
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:57,810
electrical activity will occur naturally

228
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:59,069
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a research greet a great EG</font>

229
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:03,270
that will be put on the person right now

230
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:04,770
when it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you usually think yeah</font>

231
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the top right the main</font>

232
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,790
components that you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with with</font>

233
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">mooji if you have the electrodes the</font>

234
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,550
elections they connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an amplifier</font>

235
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:15,090
and they use something analog to digital

236
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,949
conversion so there's different types of

237
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:20,220
our lectures<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can use as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pardon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

238
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:23,130
either work with wet or pass dry

239
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,570
electrodes right electrodes require you

240
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,160
to put some form of conductive paste

241
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,230
between your head and the electrode

242
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,719
itself losing weight avoid ears because

243
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,460
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a much better quality signal but</font>

244
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,160
the obvious downside is that you get

245
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,690
pasted over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's our electrodes</font>

246
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,910
it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit easier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she used in a</font>

247
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,310
day-to-day basis except the quality of

248
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,140
the signal tends to be much worse if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

249
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,329
either do passive or active electrodes

250
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,220
passive electrodes we should've<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten</font>

251
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,810
stuff but<font color="#CCCCCC"> our positive electrode is</font>

252
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,640
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a conductive material</font>

253
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,109
that runs through a wire which will then

254
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">connected amplifier on the board itself</font>

255
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,690
so the beauty of this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this type of</font>

256
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,950
design is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's much easier to work</font>

257
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,050
with multiple electrodes and it's

258
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,430
cheaper<font color="#E5E5E5"> per lecture however you can also</font>

259
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,469
have an active<font color="#CCCCCC"> i lecture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where you have</font>

260
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,630
the amplifier directly attached the

261
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,180
election itself however<font color="#E5E5E5"> this comes at a</font>

262
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:13,020
much bigger cost and it's more difficult

263
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,780
to put multiple them in in the on your

264
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,610
head at the same time so once you kind

265
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,980
of understand how these electrodes work

266
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,810
you there's a standard method that you

267
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,850
use in terms of actually placing them on

268
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,250
your head called the international

269
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,020
control system and<font color="#CCCCCC"> essentially it's just</font>

270
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,970
taking you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difference between</font>

271
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,410
here and here here and here and

272
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,800
measuring ten or twenty percent

273
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:36,420
respectively so on the left ear I took

274
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,699
an overhead picture of my friend and I

275
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:42,529
just kind of overlaid what it would look

276
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,600
like on him so once you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

277
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:46,160
electrodes placed and you're starting to

278
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,339
get signal in you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a little</font>

279
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,110
pre processing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> preprocessor just</font>

280
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:53,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">essential needs that you're getting this</font>

281
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,249
raw signal and you want to remove any

282
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:57,499
form of artifacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to make sure</font>

283
00:10:55,249 --> 00:10:59,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know you have a bandpass filter</font>

284
00:10:57,499 --> 00:11:00,559
so you're knocking all frequencies of

285
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,180
activity you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to make it a</font>

286
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:05,600
little bit more easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with that</font>

287
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">signal once you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have done that this is</font>

288
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,860
where you would get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> feature</font>

289
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,350
extraction involved so since it's way

290
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,120
too complex and the signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very well</font>

291
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,069
you have to start to do something

292
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,499
mathematical operations on it to

293
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:22,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually get some features that you can</font>

294
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:23,689
actually work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with so here's another</font>

295
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:26,420
document showing so these are different

296
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:27,860
frequencies of brain activity and you'll

297
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:31,099
see in a second here how they kind of

298
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,749
all merge into this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like raw EEG</font>

299
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,249
activity right so this is what kind of

300
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:37,790
looks like regularly but it can

301
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:40,879
decompose it from there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

302
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to build</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your classifier so you know</font>

303
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,540
there's different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

304
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,980
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,000,000 your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> method so you</font>

305
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,079
work with weirdest criminologists

306
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,149
support vector machines there are

307
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,680
networks gaussian classifiers which was

308
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:53,300
something we both specifically for<font color="#E5E5E5"> BCI's</font>

309
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,209
or you could take normally new

310
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,459
approaches as well and this is where

311
00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:00,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the feedback mechanism and this is</font>

312
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:03,439
what you tend to see most times when you

313
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,029
search for<font color="#CCCCCC"> DCI those videos like this so</font>

314
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:08,719
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> last day that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a brain-controlled</font>

315
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:10,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">joan and this was a competition that was</font>

316
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,370
the university<font color="#CCCCCC"> of florida where they had</font>

317
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:16,910
students race against each other by just

318
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:19,639
controlling don't grow across and trying

319
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:22,279
the competitors and right here this is

320
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,990
an open vci so it's an open source EEG

321
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,939
that's connected to an opening

322
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,410
prosthetic and so he's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

323
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:30,290
using EEG activity here is actually

<font color="#CCCCCC">using his jaw clenched but he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using it</font>

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:37,790
to open<font color="#CCCCCC"> close the hand so that's the</font>

326
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:39,949
basics of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a DC is well now that you</font>

327
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that what you need</font>

328
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:43,819
and then understand is how can you take

329
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:45,679
the system and actually build a form of

330
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:46,639
authentication with it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked a</font>

331
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:48,740
little bit about your keys and

332
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,939
oscillations and it can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

333
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,279
these two different<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of brain</font>

334
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:55,149
activities

335
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:58,899
build a method of authentication so one

336
00:12:55,149 --> 00:13:00,189
well-known study using an ERP asked for

337
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:02,410
individuals to stare<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a bunch of</font>

338
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:04,660
different pictures and they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">for a specific picture so say that say</font>

340
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,990
they were shown you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 pictures in</font>

341
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,870
a row<font color="#E5E5E5"> and eventually they would see the</font>

occurred when it saw the target picture

<font color="#CCCCCC">they're generally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would I believe be</font>

347
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,319
300 response and using the type of

348
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,290
system you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get an accuracy</font>

349
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:27,759
about ninety seven point six percent and

350
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,910
there's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> designs that kind of</font>

351
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,589
mimic this that have been just good the

352
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,800
one did I more interested in is in

353
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:37,389
resting state just because it requires a

354
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,008
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> less set up and all you really have</font>

355
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:42,309
to do is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thankful for two moves</font>

356
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:43,749
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> EG on your head so you</font>

357
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:46,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially would be looking at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

358
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:48,430
different brain waves and how they kind

359
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:49,839
of fit together and depending on where

360
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,969
you place your lecturers you can get

361
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,519
different levels of accuracy as to

362
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:57,699
pediculus discipline<font color="#CCCCCC"> dividual so from</font>

363
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:59,680
the grass here if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 01</font>

364
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:03,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">appeals as in the ultimate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ation which</font>

365
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,160
is placing electrodes back here you can

366
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:08,500
use that brain activity as a person is

367
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,149
still for two minutes and you can

368
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,309
collect enough samples where you can

369
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:14,949
accurately predict who they are at a

370
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:17,500
non-gay percent accuracy I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

371
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:20,290
potentially why this is possible is

372
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,209
because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence with alpha beta</font>

373
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,769
rhythms that they carry individual

374
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:25,959
traits which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being claimed to be</font>

375
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:28,899
genetically induced so there is a

376
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:31,239
generic that goes into it and just kind

377
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,319
of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a smile a side point if you</font>

378
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,309
are think you're doing this make sure

379
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:38,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the new</font>

activity below 40 Hertz so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

381
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,550
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may be having is should i</font>

382
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,069
be using this to protect your stuff at

383
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:48,490
home or work and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> short answer is no</font>

384
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:50,740
this is an absolutely terrible method of

385
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,389
doing identification or any<font color="#E5E5E5"> form of</font>

386
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">control in your house and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i totally</font>

387
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:57,550
advise you not to do it at this point

388
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:59,620
the more longer answer is if you go back

389
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:02,019
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our seven factors you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

390
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,279
a picture that's coming out so if you

391
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:05,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the universality</font>

392
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,420
it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of brain activity</font>

393
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:09,910
that you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at so for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example if</font>

394
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a type of an activity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font>

395
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,269
motor imagery which is the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

396
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,790
imagining yourself doing some form of

397
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:17,230
motion with either like your right hand

398
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,180
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> your left and are your feet and</font>

399
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:21,309
thirty percent of people can't actually

400
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,420
generate that type of activity so if you

401
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:24,160
use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a method of identification</font>

402
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:27,699
you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to work really</font>

403
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,959
well uniqueness this still has to I

404
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:30,729
think he<font color="#E5E5E5"> studied a little bit more</font>

405
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,128
because we're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much at the</font>

406
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,740
early stage and we don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much</font>

407
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:38,230
overlap there is between one person<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

408
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,649
another permanence this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also very</font>

409
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:43,629
tricky thing because EEG readings can be

410
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,370
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> trickiest thing in the world to</font>

411
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:47,769
do because so many different<font color="#E5E5E5"> factors</font>

412
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,329
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> influence your brain activity from</font>

413
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:51,100
one day to another so say for example

414
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:53,199
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a concussion you know you're</font>

415
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,730
screwed you can't use that same method

416
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,160
of authentication because your brain is

417
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,959
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely messed up even if you're</font>

418
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">just really tired you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it will</font>

419
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely mess with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the signal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

420
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:03,790
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have some someone coming</font>

421
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">here in the morning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they have to</font>

422
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,490
investigate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they spoke the whole</font>

423
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,360
night you know working in some pain it's

424
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,059
just what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can work very low</font>

425
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,000
measurability this is another thing that

426
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:14,379
it really it really suffers so I really

427
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,519
depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of headset and it</font>

428
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:16,899
will environment where it's being

429
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,059
recorded so you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be conscious of</font>

430
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:20,620
that performance it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these</font>

431
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:22,689
technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are very robust and</font>

432
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,870
there still has to be a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work done</font>

433
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:27,550
to improve<font color="#E5E5E5"> this an acceptability you</font>

434
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,949
know this might be also a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

435
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">tricky as well because you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

436
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:33,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the appropriate form factor so because</font>

437
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:35,349
the fact that if you're asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> a person</font>

438
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,359
put 56<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lecture was on their head and</font>

439
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,319
put a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> paste in their hair you</font>

440
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,029
know and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do that something</font>

441
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:43,750
like a regular basis it just makes no

442
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:45,910
sense right however sir convention I

443
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:48,429
think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where EG tends to have its</font>

444
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:50,980
biggest ring because it's a dynamic bio

445
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:52,629
signal it means that say for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example one</font>

446
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,980
system becomes compromised so say for

447
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:56,050
example you're looking at resting state

448
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,639
you can essentially switch to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ERP and</font>

449
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,899
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> still use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ring as a form of</font>

450
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,689
a specification which i think is really

451
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:03,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">awesome you can even test if you have a</font>

452
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:05,379
live signal coming in by doing like a

453
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,359
random s SVP which stands for

454
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">steady-state visual evoked potentials</font>

455
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:13,719
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you flash a light at a</font>

456
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:14,980
specific frequency that generates a

457
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,319
strong enough response in the brain that

458
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">is easily acquired by</font>

459
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,319
EG so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way to kind of see</font>

460
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:22,109
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a live signal or not</font>

461
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,938
however it's still not perfect and

462
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:25,740
because you know a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consumer</font>

463
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,630
great EGS that are out there they're IOT

464
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,340
devices you can essentially do a

465
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:32,220
man-in-the-middle attack and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

466
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,750
you're you're fucked so you know there's

467
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,909
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looked at EE jeez</font>

468
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,289
and try to do matter little pecks and

469
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:39,149
because when people are building

470
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,610
biotechnology that are actually thinking

471
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:45,029
about security you know it's not going

472
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,830
to be very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to do this so</font>

473
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:50,100
said why<font color="#CCCCCC"> would you come all the way from</font>

474
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:53,970
what y'all to tell us not to do this and

475
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:57,389
people by am your salvation ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here</font>

476
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:59,190
to save you from<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself just because I</font>

480
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:06,960
something so the one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've</font>

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">come across on quite often with the</font>

482
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> technology every so often</font>

483
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,240
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see a really really shitty</font>

484
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:13,889
Kickstarter or and its really really

485
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,360
shitty IndieGoGo that is trying to sell

486
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:17,789
you some full of new technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> advice</font>

487
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:22,049
but there's absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing of value</font>

488
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:24,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is my favorite so this is there</font>

489
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:26,158
so they're essentially what they're

490
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,659
doing is they're doing this magnetic

491
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,090
coil that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> place on the back here</font>

492
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:31,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to change your brain</font>

493
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:36,689
activity based off of the frequency of

494
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:38,189
the magnetic anyway thousand dollars of

495
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,740
sales on in the go don't like the most

496
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,899
1696 backers of this which is

497
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,820
mind-boggling and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of show</font>

498
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:46,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">you how stupid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is they're saying</font>

499
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can get enough energy from your</font>

501
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,500
the back of the head where it's actually

502
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">influence your day actually no it</font>

503
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,730
doesn't work that way the other

504
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:57,779
important thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I very that becomes</font>

505
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,700
very obvious with a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

506
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:02,820
Kickstarter's is that you know people

507
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:05,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">are building them or you know they</font>

508
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,809
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> should not be building a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jeez so</font>

509
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,750
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> product is called the super brain</font>

510
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:11,549
it was once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is her story this</font>

511
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,220
whole idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing like feedback but it</font>

512
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:16,139
was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> no it made no sense what they</font>

513
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">were trying to claim and if you look at</font>

514
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:21,178
their team a bunch of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> years but</font>

515
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:23,789
not a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> neuro scientist so they</font>

516
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:24,820
probably got like their own consumer ed

517
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:27,158
at one point or they

518
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:29,950
oh wow look we can do this amazing thing

519
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:33,730
and but they really understand to bring

520
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:35,049
at all so what I kind of see with all

521
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,659
these products is essentially becoming

522
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:39,639
21st century snake oil and so what I

523
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:41,649
want you guys to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware you know</font>

524
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:43,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">before you go if they someone comes and</font>

525
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:45,428
tries to sell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a biometric and EEG</font>

526
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:47,409
biometric or a baby's implications will

527
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:50,500
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really have to make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you ask</font>

528
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:52,210
yourself your personal questions however

529
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,130
I'm not saying I can't you can

530
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,080
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it if you want I think</font>

531
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,820
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool now I'm trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

532
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,059
something with a complication just by

533
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,500
you know usually but before you do these

534
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:04,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">things you need to consider and we can</font>

535
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,460
use this advice as well as if you ever

536
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:09,549
get approached<font color="#CCCCCC"> by someone that wants to</font>

537
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,200
sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you on something do different</font>

538
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:13,658
multiple choice of authentication if you

539
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,889
are really working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> eg so even</font>

540
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:16,690
something as simple as like you know

541
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:19,570
with like Android devices you know we

542
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:21,250
can kind of do like a pattern of but

543
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,750
they also require you to have a pin as

544
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,789
well just in case it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't you forget</font>

545
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,019
your your pattern of activity so you

546
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:29,139
know have difficulties of<font color="#E5E5E5"> identification</font>

547
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:30,460
just because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well EG</font>

548
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:34,178
as a biometrical working or<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term</font>

549
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:36,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">also a lot more steel testing has to</font>

550
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:38,320
occur it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well potentially</font>

551
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:40,000
in a controlled environment but if

552
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,889
you're going on in the field you're not

553
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,419
going to get very good results the other

554
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:45,580
thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to consider is it's not</font>

555
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:48,220
going to work with populations that

556
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,379
don't want to do it so if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

557
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,019
with the prison population or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> captured</font>

558
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:55,178
population whatever on they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

being told to do and it just completely

561
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,580
messes it up the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

562
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,350
consider want to consider related to my

572
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,429
shows to you where we stand within the

573
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,139
realm of neuroscience we're just at the

open data bases around

576
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:34,070
and and it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult it took</font>

577
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,200
a long time just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to this point</font>

578
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,970
the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider is that</font>

579
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,530
if you're doing form of experiments you

580
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,900
know if you're doing in the research

581
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,250
context you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's a lot of things</font>

00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that stop you from being able to get</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">high cost associated with it and he also</font>

586
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,280
has always have to go through optical

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,990
approvals and if you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get</font>

588
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,280
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular that's not very</font>

well understood you may not get<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

590
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,750
results just because the fact that

591
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:01,040
basically context the other thing we

592
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,110
have to consider in any don't do

593
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,909
anything the pcr design is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font>

594
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,610
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of factors that going to doing it</font>

595
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,750
well so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is some of the things that</font>

596
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to be considering when</font>

597
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:13,100
designing any form of ege system so you

598

got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure you have a good night</font>

599
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,459
signal-to-noise ratio you gotta be sure

600
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,260
that it's thinking they can work

601
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,800
comfortably and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

602
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:24,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's secure it's safe that the cost</font>

603
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:27,470
is relatively low but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fashionable i</font>

604
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:28,310
guess if that matters but there's a lot

605
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,460
of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you really have to</font>

606
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:32,570
consider and the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like give you</font>

607
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,220
an idea of like what you should be

608
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,770
thinking of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> laser cost</font>

609
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,020
you know functionality tends to draw

610
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:41,360
quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus usability right so</font>

611
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,800
some of the consumer grade ii<font color="#E5E5E5"> geez you</font>

612
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,270
know they look<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice and they're</font>

613
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,700
relatively cheap but you can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

614
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,560
much with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the other thing you</font>

615
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">really understand is that you need to</font>

616
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,730
have a good experimental design or a

617
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,129
good experimental<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol and this is</font>

618
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,630
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has messed me over so</font>

619
00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:00,560
many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't take</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the time to acquire their baby EG</font>

621
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,770
activity properly so reach out to people

622
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,800
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing their studies in</font>

623
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:08,990
neuroscience they're very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice and</font>

624
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,840
most of them will like the fact that

625
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:14,060
someone wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to them but so</font>

626
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,740
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking never cut corners realize</font>

627
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,510
that neuroscience research does take a

628
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,960
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to do it properly the give</font>

629
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:23,750
you use case of where i miss tuppence so

630
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,730
we did one child with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication</font>

631
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,760
where we working with known versus

632
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,170
unknown acronyms so based off of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> erp</font>

633
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,970
response that would be generated by a

634
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:33,370
brain based off of you know an acronym

635
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:38,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus you do it</font>

636
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:40,449
create an end 400 response however we

637
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,250
cut a lot of corners because we were

638
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,140
running short on time and what happened

639
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,460
is that we only got about 10 minutes of

640
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,370
data when we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed closer to</font>

641
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">45 controlled everything else we were</font>

642
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:52,449
working with research great easy that

643
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,200
device that the person's brain is a bios

644
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,850
setting which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

645
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">hundred-thousand-dollar machine and</font>

646
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,990
we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this massive Faraday cage so</font>

647
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,450
there was no kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like electrical</font>

648
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:05,050
electrical interference but it still

649
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:06,790
failed so how do you make your room well

650
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,500
there is enough parts out there right

651
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:12,850
now that it makes it relatively easy to

652
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:15,070
start to try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make your own you can</font>

653
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">either go down the free option there's</font>

654
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,030
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more databases of EEG</font>

655
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:21,130
activities that are out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

656
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,899
could potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the short</font>

657
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,059
Center for computational neuroscience

658
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,850
which is based out of San Diego they

659
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:29,860
have a list of<font color="#CCCCCC"> eg databases that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exist</font>

660
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,389
and you could take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at some of</font>

661
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,590
those there's some resting state data in

662
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:34,960
there and you could try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a</font>

663
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:37,120
classifier with that and you can either

664
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,920
use our cave you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> side fire and the</font>

665
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,350
new which is uh I mean either really

666
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:44,530
really great tool will for easy and the

667
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,939
mag data as well if you're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

668
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,440
looking at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the papers i would</font>

669
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:51,880
recommend taking a look at picture

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:55,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">patricia</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kime pc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> research he's probably</font>

671
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,610
the most active researcher looming so

672
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:00,699
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what your system will kind of</font>

673
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:02,709
look like it you actually so this is

674
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,420
more of a live system so if you actually

675
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,010
do want to kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a choir on hardware</font>

676
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,090
and do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this yourself these are the</font>

677
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,250
different components that you're going

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,050
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with so in the top left there</font>

679
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,780
under signal acquisition that's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

680
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:15,760
DCI so you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a G you're going to</font>

681
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">need a cap just the place the electrodes</font>

682
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,450
you can do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> as simple as like</font>

683
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,740
what I'm wearing right now which is just

684
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,970
like a standard had that<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep them</font>

685
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,100

00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,960
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> contact and then you</font>

of more this drag-and-drop interface to

697
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,899
do EG work with it's a pretty cool

00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:12,710
the emotive is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 14 channel easy but it</font>

709
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:14,840
tends<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little bit more expensive</font>

710
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:17,390
and the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't necessarily</font>

711
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,970
like is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they make you pay forty</font>

712
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,680
nine dollars a month to do 50 session so

713
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,120
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really targeting researchers and</font>

714
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,860
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> really pivoted on tomorrow</font>

715
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,810
because very much the beginning they

716
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,639
were drugging you know consumers but now

717
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:31,879
you know they realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the money's</font>

718
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,670
not there you also go with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the news the</font>

719
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,170
news is a relatively simple EEG it's

720
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,540
just elections that you place over your

721
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,800
forehead I haven't we tried to do it

722
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,260
with lessons people you might get some

723
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,510
interesting results but the more popular

724
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:47,420
one is the open bc i when it comes to

725
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:50,030
makers so it's a look so easy we could

726
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:52,670
either get four or eight electrodes and

727
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:54,110
they also provide the building materials

728
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:59,270
and the schematics with it if you ever

729
00:26:54,110 --> 00:27:00,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to spoil it yourself and you can bc</font>

730
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:02,210
is also pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome something</font>

731
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:05,270
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that it's been shown</font>

732
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:06,950
to work on different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of e art p</font>

733
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:10,910
responses so someone has built the p300

734
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:13,430
speller with an<font color="#CCCCCC"> erp sorry with open bc i</font>

735
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:14,660
and they got relatively good with us

736
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:17,120
there's also a few papers I've been

737
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,580
published recently that assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

738
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,229
belt<font color="#CCCCCC"> that consumer grade EG is just as</font>

739
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:24,500
good maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit worse as</font>

740

your<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost that you have to think about</font>

742
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,750
so if you're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with an eight</font>

743
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,909
channel open bc i'll be about 500 us

744
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,800
four channels 200 if you include all the

745
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:35,000
parts if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what I like showed</font>

746
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,430
the console will be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

747
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">put your work will try it'll cost you</font>

748
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:42,080
about two hundred seventy bucks so with

the front lines github a puzzle box i

765
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:18,190
know he creates open source EG tools our

766
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:19,540
toys rather but if you do want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to join</font>

us<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the Norfolk actually ever</font>

770
00:28:31,300 --> 00:29:05,530
questions all right questions when i

771
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:19,390
recommend the concussion no no just just

772
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:23,410
delete the data that's a difficult

773
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:24,520
question but i would say i would say

774
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,380
there's a few things that have to

775
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,429
improve so the robustness of these

776
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">systems is definitely one of those</font>

777
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:31,990
things that really have to be figured

778
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:33,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that is the machine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learning</font>

779
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:36,280
gets a lot better within the domain it

780
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,510
will speed up the process of making

781
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:41,200
these systems a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit more robust</font>

782
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:43,510
and as more material sciences looked

783
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,929
into and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> forth and may improve</font>

784
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,250
it i would say i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know i'll be</font>

785
00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:52,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">making up a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number but i'll just say</font>

786
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:55,210
five years yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the baseball cap</font>

787
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,410
that introduces other issues so you'd

788
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to make sure the electrodes are</font>

789
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:00,130
placed<font color="#E5E5E5"> properly you it's still the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

790
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:01,900
issues right you still have to require a

791
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:04,000
lot of data from a specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> individual</font>

792
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,370
and with the baseball<font color="#E5E5E5"> cap the issue is</font>

793
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,230
the safe it moves you won't be able to

794
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:10,178
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it moves right so like most of</font>

795
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,380
the designs of EEG cats actually allow

796
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:13,240
for you see where the election took

797
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,710
place just to make sure that it's being

798
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:25,090
done properly but with a cap it's just

799
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:26,860
not visible the back room so the

800
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is if someone with ms or</font>

801
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,590
Alzheimer's could have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> sakata</font>

802
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:31,150
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that would go against</font>

803
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,980
the authentication it probably would

804
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,630
just create a lot more problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

805
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:44,320
value but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can't say what the hundred</font>

806
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:51,550
percent certainty question the back like

807
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:54,309
what so i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can generate thought</font>

808
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:56,620
phosphine<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i can introduce like a fake</font>

809
00:30:54,309 --> 00:31:01,780
light<font color="#E5E5E5"> just using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keys yet hallucinations</font>

810
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:03,699
I guess no not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really I mean I've done</font>

811
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:08,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've used them used as a meditation</font>

812
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:10,450
school and but it's not really causing

813
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,950
me to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not causing me to</font>

814
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:14,020
hallucinate it's just giving me a method

815
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:16,270
to determine how well I'm meditating

816
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:18,400
actually I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of oxymoronic</font>

817
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:20,918
if you think of a real feedback

818
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,570
meditation tool because if you're always

819
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:24,220
kind of like thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact</font>

820
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:25,149
that how well you're doing while you're

821
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:29,169
meditating you're not actually

822
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:30,700
meditating so wisdom<font color="#E5E5E5"> use device what I</font>

823
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:32,320
tend to do as I turn off<font color="#E5E5E5"> any live</font>

824
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:40,809
feedback I just kind of get my score at

825
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:43,830
the end so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer is no no no all</font>

826
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:43,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font>
