1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,110
sounds good to me cool all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> my name</font>

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,480
is oh there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people not</font>

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:17,310
coming in all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just are you</font>

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,490
guys can listen along sup my name is

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,538
Eric Escobar I<font color="#CCCCCC"> work for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> secure works and</font>

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,430
today I'm gonna talk to you guys about

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,510
replay text with Software Defined radio

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,730
or SDR<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what does replay tech</font>

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,560
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what it sounds like an</font>

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,350
attacker captures a signal and they can

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,670
play back at a later point in time and

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,500
you kind of wonder like how in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this day</font>

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,910
and age can this be a thing and it's

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,860
because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the Chinese crap</font>

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,050
that's out there it's really really easy

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,760
to program this and you know they can

17
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">make a quick buck off of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,539
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the 433 megahertz stuff</font>

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,239
that's out there it's all replay attacks

20
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,420
or it's all susceptible to it so what a

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,099
software-defined radio<font color="#CCCCCC"> its str and this</font>

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,230
is a type of device where everything is

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,489
done in software you don't have to worry

24
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,218
about an embedded device you have to

25
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,809
tune anything it's generally just out of

26
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,659
the box plug it in plug and play<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go</font>

27
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,310
and it makes testing a lot easier and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

28
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,470
makes learning and hacking way easier

29
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,420
just because you have all these extra

30
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,789
frequencies at your disposal so it's

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,990
pretty easy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other thing that I</font>

32
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,490
really like about it it's a really small

33
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,320
form factor so you don't have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

34
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a full ham closet you know just the</font>

35
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,110
power<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you do it straight off</font>

36
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,100
of your laptop and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty easy so</font>

37
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,470
some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

38
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">about before we go into all of replay</font>

39
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,060
tax is some of the verbiage he might

40
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to know first duplex see I don't</font>

41
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if that's a word but I made</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a</font>

42
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,639
word so basically if you have a half

43
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,890
duplex that means you can only transmit

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,850
and receive on you know at a single time

45
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,890
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a walkie-talkie</font>

46
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,929
on a walkie-talkie you can only listen

47
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,360
at a given point in time or talk a given

48
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,619
point I'm you can't do both that's full

49
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,570
duplex if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> something is full</font>

50
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,159
duplex you can transmit and receive at

51
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,600
the same time and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a phone</font>

52
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,890
conversation and that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

53
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,110
the best example just visualize it next

54
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,450
is a sample so a lot of times you'll see

55
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,579
software-defined radios measured in

56
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,128
samples or<font color="#CCCCCC"> MSPs so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's million samples</font>

57
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,869
per second you know it's a double-edged

58
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,910
sword<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can have way too many</font>

59
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,750
samples and your processors not going to

60
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,520
be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle it it's</font>

61
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> choke you know you're going to burn</font>

62
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,000
through all your battery you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font>

63
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,200
view samples and you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get a signal to come across just</font>

65
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,200
because you can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what's</font>

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,580
going on so you kind of want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in</font>

67
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,200
the Goldilocks zone you want to get

68
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,480
enough samples where your processor can

69
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,940
handle it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just fine and you also want to</font>

70
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,170
have you basically just eat you don't

71
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to overclock your processor and</font>

72
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,290
you'd want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hurt it but you want to</font>

73
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">get enough to actually get a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> signal</font>

74
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:40,109
to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> across next up is frequency</font>

75
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,940
ranges a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

76
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,920
this from like high school physics but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

77
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,560
hurts is one cycle a second so that's

78
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,780
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> one one blip across the radar</font>

79
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the higher frequency the more cycles</font>

80
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,840
that you get per second it's kind of

81
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,830
elementary stuff but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

82
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,450
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they don't they don't know</font>

83
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,280
the basics and so when you start talking

84
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,890
vernacular to them they'll get kind of

85
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,870
confused so just as an FYI this is again

86
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,609
probably every high school science book

87
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,989
this is the the spectrum they kind of

88
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">dealing with what I marked out in red</font>

89
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:09,660
here that's generally like what you

90
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,190
would see like a general SDR that you're

91
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to buy on the market today these</font>

92
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,890
are the ranges that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font>

93
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,950
of get you can get anywhere from in the

94
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,859
high kilohertz<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the you know mid mid</font>

95
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,959
gigahertz range and you have all your

96
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,690
ham frequencies you have your gps Wi-Fi

97
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,930
all that good stuff is in their midst up

98
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,820
man it's all pretty accessible so this

99
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">is kind of just a quick overview kind of</font>

100
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,320
kind of going over the different things

101
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,090
that different software<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine radios have</font>

102
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,530
so if you're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting into it and</font>

103
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,549
you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want to like I just want</font>

104
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">to mess around i don't wanna have a high</font>

105
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,329
cost<font color="#CCCCCC"> users get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty dollar it's</font>

106
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,900
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> TV tuner that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can buy off</font>

107
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:49,380
amazon and I've so if you follow the

108
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,610
wireless CTF<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cipher con I posted all</font>

109
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,780
links to all of these so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

110
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,950
right in town or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just go</font>

111
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,600
pull them up from there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what I'm</font>

112
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the first</font>

113
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">one again like I said it's a TV tuner so</font>

114
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,670
its twenty dollars you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can only</font>

115
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,500
receive so you're not gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

116
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,839
transmit anything but it has a really

117
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,370
wide range in a pretty decent sample

118
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,560
rate so with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see a lot of</font>

119
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,610
stuff so you can see pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

120
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,709
the signals that were going to talk

121
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">about in the replay text that I'm going</font>

122
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,760
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show later on you can receive all of</font>

123
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,529
those here and so it's a good real entry

124
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,029
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just want to mess around it's</font>

125
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,349
cheap and easy to use and there's a ton

126
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,358
<font color="#CCCCCC">of tutorials on how to plug it in</font>

127
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,099
drivers all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff is really well</font>

128
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,870
supported the next one on the list is

129
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:25,820
the yardstick the yardstick is you know

130
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred fifteen dollars</font>

131
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,020
again another entry<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and this will</font>

132
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,450
allow you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to transmit it doesn't have a</font>

133
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,960
super stellar frequency range you know

134
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:38,599
282 962 megahertz<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's only half duplex</font>

135
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,979
so again you can only listen or talk at

136
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">a time you can't you know you can't do</font>

137
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,370
both and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then if you keep going down the</font>

138
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,780
list the price keeps going up and

139
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,030
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're getting with this is a</font>

140
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:50,210
wider sample set you more samples per

141
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,590
second you know full duplex and then if

142
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,659
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at something like the blade RF</font>

143
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,909
right now it's like 650 you get full

144
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,650
duplex you know you have a huge range of

145
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,850
things you can do and you can go crazy

146
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,280
and then they have temperature

147
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,200
stabilized one so what will happen is if

148
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,150
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like say a blade RF and you're</font>

149
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,070
you know looking at something and if as

150
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,719
it starts to heat up your signal start

151
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,670
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> vary and so they have temperature</font>

152
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,930
corrected one so pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> the higher</font>

153
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,820
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go up on the scale you get more</font>

154
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,650
features there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more stuff that's</font>

155
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,650
not in here but this is just a good

156
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">general view to look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at of some of the</font>

157
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,950
features that they have I'm kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how</font>

158
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,880
to compare them one to one because

159
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,060
that's another hard thing that you get

160
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,040
into with<font color="#CCCCCC"> scrs if you see one oh this is</font>

161
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,420
like two grand this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is three grand you</font>

162
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,920
know and they go up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and up and up and</font>

163
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't even need those</font>

164
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,890
features or something really specialized

165
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,840
that it's like oh yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need it</font>

166
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,340
shielded against you know X amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

167
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,659
radiation I don't really care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

168
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,140
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know trying to read my</font>

169
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,460
water meter in my backyard so yeah just

170
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's kind of nice to know and kind of</font>

171
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice to have this so okay you have a</font>

172
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,090
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want to capture a signal</font>

173
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,740
off of you know now what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do so</font>

174
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,869
the hard way you can do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know</font>

175
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,730
you can look at this waterfall chart or

176
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,260
waterfall graph and you can see signals

177
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,760
as they come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is typically</font>

178
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,620
the hard way of doing it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

179
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,180
can look at the spectrum you can try and

180
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,740
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense of what the bleeps</font>

181
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,740
and bloops look like there's full

182
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,090
websites dedicated to just like you know

183
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,650
what like I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the signal looks</font>

184
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,590
like and people will just sit there all

185
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,849
day and ponder as to what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are but</font>

186
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,770
really that's that's a pretty difficult

187
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,940
thing to do and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to you know</font>

188
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,229
that's that's where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do and</font>

189
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't want to try and T something</font>

190
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,890
you know T sub modulation out of this

191
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,940
it's going to be a pain and there's a

192
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:26,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of trouble shooting that goes into</font>

193
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,469
it so the easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> way is you cheat and so</font>

194
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,729
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> device if you own the</font>

195
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,260
device<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can look at the back of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

196
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,240
device and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have a typically an FCC</font>

197
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:35,390
ID if it's something sold the United

198
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,950
States which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is super nice because in</font>

199
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,740
order to get a register with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the FCC you</font>

200
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,449
have to give out

201
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,220
all the specs and all the modulation and

202
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:44,190
pretty much everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

203
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,960
ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> want is a hacker to use so this for</font>

204
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,479
example is a motion detector so just

205
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,448
look at the back of s of the of the

206
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,789
transmitter you look at the FCC<font color="#E5E5E5"> ID write</font>

207
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:56,430
it down and the FCC website is

208
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,539
absolutely terrible it's a horrible

209
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing to try and go search</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a look</font>

210
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,630
through all the menus so some hero I

211
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,699
should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> put his name on here because</font>

212
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:05,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">he definitely deserves credit he made</font>

213
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:08,490
sec I oh and basically all<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is you'd</font>

214
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:10,530
go FCC io / whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the FCC ideas and</font>

215
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,659
it will forward you to the actual SEC

216
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,369
page so it saves you know like 30

217
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:16,650
different steps and trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

218
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,630
like how where is this what is this you

219
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,739
know who's the stakeholder and it you

220
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,240
not to worry about any of that it'll

221
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,590
just take you straight to the page it

222
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">also makes really easy if you're like in</font>

223
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,008
a forum discussion with somebody or you

224
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,330
posting something in slack to just shoot

225
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:30,060
them this link instead of trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

226
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,580
dig up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FCC link that would normally</font>

227
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,319
come up and so with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can look at</font>

228
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,330
the test reports you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see photos you</font>

229
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the manuals and really what you're</font>

230
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,849
looking here from this is the the

231
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,469
frequency and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the modulation so this</font>

232
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:45,659
this is where it kind of gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

233
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:47,460
more craftier part the part<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

234
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:49,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to know a little bit more your</font>

235
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,539
physics for so there's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

236
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,539
people are probably most<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with</font>

237
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:56,610
AM and FM modulation or you know AM FM

238
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:58,770
frequencies right you have your you have

239
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,909
your radio and this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it means you</font>

240
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,190
can see the little gift that's kind of

241
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:03,840
spinning their amplitude modulation the

242
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,190
waves get bigger and smaller and

243
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,258
frequency modulation it kinda looks like

244
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:10,199
a slinky it'll get squished together and

245
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:13,139
that's how data is encoded in there now

246
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,240
the type of encoding that that they're

247
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">using here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the type of amplitude</font>

248
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,169
modulation called<font color="#CCCCCC"> on/off keen so</font>

249
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically all it is is it's a it's a</font>

250
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:22,109
digital way of transmitting data and

251
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,930
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of cheap</font>

252
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:27,210
electronics use and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see that as</font>

253
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,159
a blip<font color="#CCCCCC"> ty that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one if it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blips low</font>

254
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:32,218
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero and so you basically</font>

255
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:34,110
could just do binary over this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

256
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:36,390
of just going into how all of these

257
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,579
electronics work the reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do</font>

258
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:41,549
this is because you can have your radios

259
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:42,809
they can be really off they you know

260
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:45,719
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be tuned super</font>

261
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:46,890
precise you're not really caring you

262
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,199
don't really care about interference

263
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,089
because it's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things where</font>

264
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:53,339
you know you

265
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:54,839
retransmit the signal probably every

266
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,980
five<font color="#CCCCCC"> or six times something gets</font>

267
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,629
triggered like so for example for a

268
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">motion detector you wave your hand in</font>

269
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:01,529
front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and it will trigger six</font>

270
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,878
times instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> just one time and</font>

271
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,069
that's basically to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do with interference</font>

272
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,509
it's a really cheap easy dumb way it's

273
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:07,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of like a UDP way of you know</font>

274
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:09,389
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with something you're not</font>

275
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:11,009
waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a transmission back you just</font>

276
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:12,420
sending out in space and hoping that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

277
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,550
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> through and you send it a bunch of</font>

278
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,649
times just<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the off chance that one of</font>

279
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,998
them gets through and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the back</font>

280
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:19,709
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that you deal with that is</font>

281
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:21,689
you just say if I receive a signal

282
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:25,050
within X amount of milliseconds just

283
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:27,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">only choose one ignore the rest and so</font>

284
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:30,329
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> again super easy way to code it</font>

285
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so that's why they do it that way so</font>

286
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:34,410
what's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is that</font>

287
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:38,790
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tune your software defined radio</font>

288
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:40,199
and export the signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a WAV file this</font>

289
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">wave file can be opened up so i like to</font>

290
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:44,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">use audacity and if you tune it right</font>

291
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,339
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see the blips and bloops as they</font>

292
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:48,990
come across the screen which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really</font>

293
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,309
cool because then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can so the old</font>

294
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,589
school way of doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what you</font>

295
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:54,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">would normally have to do is print this</font>

296
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:56,339
out with the time you get some graph

297
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:58,859
paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you would mark out where the</font>

298
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,329
ones are where the zeros are and then

299
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,829
you could generate that signal if you

300
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:04,229
knew the timing of it then you could

301
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:05,910
replay it back but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a really</font>

302
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,009
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> way of doing it and now there's a</font>

303
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,870
ton of tools out there that do it and

304
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:12,449
and they make it a lot nicer and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

305
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:15,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually cleaned up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> WAV file now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

306
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:17,429
there's you know you make use of your

307
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,079
processor and basically what that does

308
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:20,670
is it'll go and clean up the waveform

309
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,160
for you to get these nice little blocks

310
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,809
instead of you might see you know some

311
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,969
Jake unisom waviness around it and it'd

312
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:31,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">be kind of hard to see your times from</font>

313
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:34,050
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so talking about some of</font>

314
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:36,599
the software that's out there so so

315
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,939
there's GQ<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rx and good new radio those</font>

316
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,100
are the two big you know unix platforms

317
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:43,230
if you're using that some of the other

318
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,360
nice tools if you're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows or SD</font>

319
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,620
are sharp<font color="#E5E5E5"> scr sharp has a couple of</font>

320
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,550
plugins<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not on the slides</font>

321
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,019
but i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mention it because</font>

322
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,139
it's super<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool i'll just playing with</font>

323
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:54,089
it earlier is you can actually snag

324
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:55,740
beacons off of aircraft that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> flying</font>

325
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:57,809
overhead they're not encrypted totally

326
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">plaintext and they'll give you altitude</font>

327
00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:02,250
you know the call sign of the plane

328
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,760
they'll give you all that information of

329
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,500
where it's going

330
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,939
it's really crazy because you you know

331
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're full on programs built out for</font>

332
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,610
it that you can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this running</font>

333
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">on your desktop and you can see all the</font>

planes in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> airspace where they're</font>

335
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,640
going where they're headed you know

336
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,810
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> free no internet required and</font>

337
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,750
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of terrifying that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

338
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,699
information is just out there and so

339
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,220
then then the other part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it too is if</font>

340
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,320
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a hack RF michael osman has</font>

341
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,340
awesome awesome software he has an

342
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,500
awesome tutorial that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

343
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">here in a little bit that basically is a</font>

344
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,650
two-day class condensed you know to a

345
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,790
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube videos they can</font>

346
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,010
download for free i think it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

347
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,750
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand dollar class but we'll</font>

348
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,740
talk more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that then one of the</font>

349
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,050
other things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> had just got into</font>

350
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,240
recently is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a RS cat it's like netcat</font>

351
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,740
but for RF stuff it's super easy to use

352
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,600
super simple everything's a Python

353
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">object so if you're writing you know</font>

354
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,310
some you know software-defined radio

355
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,810
program and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know python super killer</font>

356
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,239
super easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can receive</font>

357
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,739
transmitting code stuff however you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

358
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,590
to do it and then one of the other even

359
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:04,000
cheater tools that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i use is this on-off</font>

360
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:05,470
keying tool so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay tools basically what</font>

361
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,150
this does is this will clean up your

362
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,470
wave files it will process your wave

363
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:11,140
file so you don't have to worry about

364
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,910
any of it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll search for</font>

365
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,740
frequencies it'll look for<font color="#CCCCCC"> on/off keen</font>

366
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,199
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know maybe exactly what</font>

367
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,700
the frequency is of you know some device

368
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,130
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> using if you're trying to black box</font>

369
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,260
it you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an FCC ID to go off of</font>

370
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,540
you can use this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay tools it'll scan</font>

371
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,010
spectrum look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> on/off keen it'll find</font>

372
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,230
the baud rate for you all these things

373
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you would normally have to you know</font>

374
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,740
get some graph paper out for you know

375
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,780
open up ms paint and you know try and

376
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,160
drag some lines on you don't have to do

377
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,930
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tool takes care of a</font>

378
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,370
lot of it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only downside is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that as</font>

379
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,709
far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as i know again and won't play with</font>

380
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit that it only works for the</font>

381
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,210
yardstick one but it's pretty killer and

382
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,069
if you're you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know just just trying to</font>

383
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:52,570
inspect some stuff it's a super nice way

384
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:54,820
to go so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a really simplistic way</font>

385
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,400
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get up off the</font>

386
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,170
ground doing a replay signal if you have

387
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,780
a hack RF you can just type this line in

388
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:05,260
there and should be an underscore in the

389
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,970
hack RF transfer basically you use the

390
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,920
hack RF transfer and you can receive

391
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,590
dump it out to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> WAV file which is your</font>

392
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,300
dot raw and then the dash<font color="#E5E5E5"> f that's a</font>

393
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:17,230
that's the frequency that you're on and

394
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:20,829
so it's it's in hurts and so

395
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,330
should be 434 megahertz but it's 43 you

396
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,610
know million hurts<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's just without</font>

397
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,830
without any of the scientific notation

398
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,330
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of reduce the variable down but</font>

399
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,860
so this all you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> video is literally</font>

400
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,180
write it out to one file and then you

401
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,250
replay that file at that frequency

402
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,510
what's nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that they give you the</font>

403
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,280
frequency as an option there that you

404
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,530
can pass in so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to record</font>

405
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">it in at a lower frequency and replayed</font>

406
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,610
out on a higher one that that's you know

407
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,620
it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely work and the reason why</font>

408
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">you would want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that is so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say you</font>

409
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,980
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to receive on a very narrow</font>

410
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,050
frequency you can receive on a very

411
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,880
narrow one and transmit on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> wideband</font>

412
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,319
one and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why you might want to</font>

413
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,270
do that is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody has some</font>

414
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,070
protection in place like for like say

415
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,170
they have a rolling code<font color="#CCCCCC"> well you can</font>

416
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,850
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for is you can receive on the</font>

417
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,310
very narrow band but pretty much<font color="#CCCCCC"> Doss</font>

418
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rest of it and so what that i'll let</font>

419
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,479
you do is accept a rolling code<font color="#CCCCCC"> transmit</font>

420
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,890
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> das at the same time so just I mean</font>

421
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,360
that that's above what we're going to go

422
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,380
over today but that's a reason why you

423
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,390
would want it and it's a really cool

424
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">feature that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like CM e</font>

425
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">km car have used that to do their role</font>

426
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:21,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">jam attack and break it into pretty much</font>

427
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:22,960
any card that's on the market today<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

428
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,270
so what's vulnerable it's shocking

429
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,190
actually the the amount of cheap you

430
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,260
know 434 megahertz stuff that you can

431
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,870
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the internet so let's</font>

432
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:36,280
see if the demo gods are with me this

433
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:37,780
should play so if I so basically this is

434
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,199
a motion detector and you can see that

435
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:43,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking the battery out of it but you can</font>

436
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,550
still get to play a tannery play tag so

437
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,900
I turned off the volume because it's a

438
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,500
really annoying sound but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

439
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,790
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal lit up it plays without</font>

440
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,620
that and you can do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing with</font>

441
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,360
a doorbell which is incredibly fun I've

442
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,490
never really grown up so go over my

443
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,830
in-laws house and I doorbell ditch them

444
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:02,200
from like half a house<font color="#E5E5E5"> away and they</font>

445
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:03,370
have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's happening it feel</font>

446
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,230
kind of bad and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hope they never</font>

447
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:09,220
watch this talk because we've done it

448
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:11,050
mercilessly so some<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

449
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can do this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also a really fun one</font>

450
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,949
so they've these there<font color="#CCCCCC"> etech City</font>

451
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,090
wireless outlets these things are great

452
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to have you know if you have</font>

453
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,210
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to like maybe</font>

454
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">some backyard light you want to turn on</font>

455
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,600
and off well one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started</font>

456
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">playing with was like well I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

457
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,420
turn them off from like my raspberry pi

458
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,579
or my arduino like how am I going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

459
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,410
that well if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's</font>

460
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some cheap 430</font>

461
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,699
or megahertz module you can just do a

462
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,109
replay attack and turn them on and off

463
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,939
however you want so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to be</font>

464
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,160
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenges tomorrow so if you</font>

465
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:42,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys are doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wireless capture the</font>

466
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,170
flag the goal is going to be to not to

467
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,000
turn on the last one and so since

468
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're all in a series you have to turn</font>

469
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">them on in sequential order and if you</font>

470
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,449
turn one off it'll mess you up so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

471
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,579
is what it should look like see see how

472
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:56,439
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> all click on sequentially that's</font>

473
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,638
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end goal of it so if you're doing</font>

474
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:59,560
the wireless capture the flag tomorrow

475
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:04,029
that's that's when you may want to pay

476
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:06,189
attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my uncle's super</font>

477
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:09,040
swanky neighborhood that he lives in and

478
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:10,719
you think that like this gated

479
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,160
subdivision where each house is like you

480
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,329
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> three million dollars minimum that</font>

481
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,339
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a better gate than this</font>

482
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:17,170
but I can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically sit here wait</font>

483
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:19,240
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody to go by catch the signal</font>

484
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,839
and replay the signal and the gate just

485
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">opens no problem at all this one was</font>

486
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:25,509
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too because you could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

487
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,069
hold the gate open and so you get

488
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:28,480
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> come out and say like what like</font>

489
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:31,810
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on why you know why won't</font>

490
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,100
this gate<font color="#E5E5E5"> close and yet you can just</font>

491
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:36,459
even really mess with people with this

492
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,930
stuff so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really fun one this</font>

493
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:39,339
will also<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wireless capture the</font>

494
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,800
flags tomorrow if anybody's brave enough

495
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:43,240
to attempt<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this is a dog shock</font>

496
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,990
collar that doesn't have any rolling

497
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">code or any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything to make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not do</font>

498
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,589
this so I'll kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of run it through its</font>

499
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:52,269
paces I don't know if this one does so

500
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:53,649
it lights it up and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it vibrates</font>

501
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:55,839
there's no volley<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can see move</font>

502
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:57,310
across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen so one of the really</font>

503
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,620
scary things about this one and I

504
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:04,178
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried it out yet is that the way</font>

505
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:05,589
that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> encoded is so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is 255 value</font>

506
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:08,140
that you could put so the shock collar

507
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:09,879
you can have a range of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 to 100 to</font>

508
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">shock someone with or you're shocked</font>

509
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,169
your dog with right but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

510
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,000
possible value of 255 in there so I

511
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:17,980
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it just Oh missed it after</font>

512
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,209
100 or what's going to happen but

513
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,799
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one way to test it and I'm</font>

514
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:23,079
definitely not<font color="#E5E5E5"> brave enough that this</font>

515
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,819
thing can put you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 pound German</font>

516
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:30,129
Shepherd on its but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would just</font>

517
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:31,059
cook me so okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn</font>

518
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,350
some more about you know

519
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:34,539
software-defined radio if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you kind of</font>

520
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,770
wanna get started with it or even if you

521
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:37,390
know a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have your</font>

522
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,559
software defined radio I'd really

523
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggest going over to Great Scott</font>

524
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,059
gadgets calm / SDR so Michael Osman

525

soup to nuts of like hey you don't know

530
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,730
anything about radio we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

531
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:56,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">teach you all about it how do you know</font>

we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show you how to use the</font>

534
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,889
hack RF you no soup to nuts how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

535
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:05,529
perform the replay<font color="#CCCCCC"> tax it's a really</font>

536
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:08,289
really great class it's I mean it's very

537
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:10,450
very dense but it's completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> free</font>

538
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:11,529
online on the internet and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is again</font>

539
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,299
it's a really expensive class you have

540
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:15,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go to and I kind of just googling</font>

541
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:17,860
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> I happen to find it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's it's</font>

542
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,749
a really really top-notch class the

543
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,908
other website that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really like is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RTLS</font>

544
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:23,740
dr this website you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people in</font>

545
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:25,929
the forms are really responsive so if

546
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,149
you do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hard use case scenario</font>

547
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:30,399
of like oh my gosh like I don't know

548
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:32,559
this frequency is you know maybe you've

549
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:34,149
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen like like some something new</font>

550
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,350

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,939
you know slanting pattern is across my

553
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,320
waterfall display these guys are all

554
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,490
super sharp and they'll be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

555

Twitter account you can just look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it</font>

589
00:19:54,070 --> 00:20:02,918
something that they follow

590
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:05,320
if you don't have a hack RS I have one

591
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,610
that you can use I have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacker i5 a</font>

592
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,439
yardstick and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely willing to</font>

593
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">show people how to use in all that stuff</font>

594
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,929
if you don't know how or if you're just

595
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:12,610
like I need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> loaner to do the challenge</font>

596
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:13,840

597
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,969
that you can use and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a couple</font>

600
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:30,518
yeah yeah so that's that's going to like

601
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:31,600
the main base of<font color="#E5E5E5"> operations so i'll be</font>

602
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,980
up there<font color="#CCCCCC"> tomorrow morning when it opens</font>

603
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,029
up i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it opens up at nine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

604
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,879
too<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll to go look at the schedule</font>

605
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:38,379
but basically i'll be up there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're</font>

606
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:39,820
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have stuff kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of spread out</font>

607
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:41,709
depending on how the weather is tomorrow

608
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,240
it'll be spread out out and around

609
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">milwaukee there's you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know sometimes</font>

610
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,539
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something crazy a couple of</font>

611
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,039
challenges there's going to be war

612
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:49,990
driving so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what we've done is</font>

613
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:54,580
we've pre-war driven a bunch of

614
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:56,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">milwaukee we have 7,500 points and so</font>

615
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,480
that nobody can really brute force it

616
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,710
basically like say is that of 100 points

617
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,740
i'm not sure what the point values of it

618
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:04,330
yet but say you get you know 3,500

619
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,370
points then you're only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

620
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,360
around half of the points that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

621
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,500
totally possible so you're not just

622
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,678
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look oh I'm just going to go</font>

623
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,450
generate a gajillion BSS<font color="#CCCCCC"> ids and you use</font>

624
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">that as something like that will prevent</font>

625
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,600
that but basically i'll be up there<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

626
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:18,789
entire day you can tweet if you have

627
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,899
questions they'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wireless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> foxes</font>

628
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:22,360
running around there's going to be

629
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:24,639
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> stations on ham radio frequencies</font>

630
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,959
and again all the hints will kind of

631
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:27,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">come out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not going to</font>

632
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,409
probably dumped everything all at once

633
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,480
all kind of see how things go but pretty

634
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:33,190
much all the SDR challenges will be up

635
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,649
in that building or it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be up in</font>

636
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:38,289
that in that room I think there's room

637
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:41,139
for like 15 20 people from not mistaken

638
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:42,220
so we'll go with that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you again</font>

639
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:44,199

642
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:51,908
