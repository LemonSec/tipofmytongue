12
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,870
going to talk about predictive analytics

13
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,820
and some of the tools that are readily

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,739
accessible to people who probably don't

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,609
use predictive analytics on a daily

16
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:06,030
basis I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> apologize right now I</font>

17
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:11,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> word hash anywhere in my</font>

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:27,630
discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no md5 no sha-1</font>

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:30,689
so I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah when I first</font>

moment here if you have complaints you

26
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,490
talk to him but more importantly this is

27
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:54,310
a huge accomplishment that<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year's</font>

28
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,320
last year's was half this size and it

29
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,450
just gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> better and better so make sure</font>

30
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,710
you you know give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them a nod before you</font>

31
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:04,630
walk up door hey yeah the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

32
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,788
the question Mike asked me when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

33
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:10,329
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know yeah I'll come and talk as long</font>

34
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:12,040
as there's free beer well why on earth

35
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,100
would I want to date<font color="#E5E5E5"> a guy at a hacker</font>

36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,440
con because I already told them Mike

37
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:25,690
that the word hash is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere in my</font>

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:28,390
discussion so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about the grand</font>

39
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,160
theory of hacking in general you know

40
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,589
because the average public kind of have

41
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,230
this tremendous misconception of hackers

42
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:41,530
you know that there's this malicious

43
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:44,108
basement dweller in terms of 9j and

44
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,299
streams you know hacking people's

45
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:50,530
facebook accounts and getting ed when

46
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:54,069
they do it mm-hmm I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one ok</font>

47
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,620
this is this general impression<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

48
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:58,600
that's not what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we know that you</font>

49
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,750
know cuz they're really at its core the

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">term hacking has to do with you know</font>

51
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:08,109
somehow altering and manipulating what

52
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:11,139
we already<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to get to something we</font>

53
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:14,380
don't or taking something that's already

54
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:17,170
been created and tweaking it in such a

55
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,230
way that it's new and different right

56
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:30,760
see the way to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom it says right</font>

57
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:33,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok so i am going to then argue that as a</font>

58
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,179
data miner data is like the ultimate

59
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:39,620
hack

60
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:41,569
and it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is let's be realistic how</font>

61
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:45,500
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you and your jobs have ever had</font>

62
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:51,920
somebody high up who shouldn't even know

63
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:54,500
your name come ask you for data I mean

64
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,108
your hands I won't ask you to do that

65
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,430
often but yeah and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

66
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:02,840
view that didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> raise your hands you're</font>

67
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:08,900
lying<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because they do we live</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

68
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:11,419
data-driven universe so data mining

69
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,889
becomes the ultimate hack and and here's

70
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:14,209
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Testament out on the bottom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

71
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:17,989
that's the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I'll read off the</font>

72
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:20,209
screen but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the truth with it we can</font>

73
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:28,340
gain knowledge that can benefit mankind

74
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:31,910
absolutely we human perceptions<font color="#CCCCCC"> you show</font>

75
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:37,250
people data you present the data in a

76
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:41,900
way that promotes an argument and it

77
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:44,479
becomes gospel you can change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the course</font>

78
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">of human history you can alter the</font>

79
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:51,289
trajectory of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> billion dollar company</font>

80
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:54,260
with data you can take what you have

81
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:59,449
manipulated in a new and interesting way

82
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:03,199
to discover something you didn't hacking

83
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:08,930
right there it's awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm sorry</font>

84
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:15,229
there's no hash involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so with</font>

85
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:18,770
that said and this is my disclaimer the

86
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:23,210
reality is is you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that I mean</font>

87
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:29,780
you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> can I'm not joking I do it</font>

88
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:31,940
millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dollars in John the data</font>

89
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:39,409
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> produce and the way I produce it</font>

90
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:42,889
people's<font color="#CCCCCC"> lives change based on the data</font>

91
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:46,099
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> produce and the way I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> produce so the</font>

92
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:48,470
reality is is that somewhere within that

93
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,770
comes a certain ethical responsibility

94
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:55,190
to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're presenting data in</font>

95
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:57,680
a logical in a reasonable in an

96
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,780
efficient manner that portrays the

97
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:06,740
greatest similarity to the truth

98
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:09,380
possible so just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give everybody a</font>

99
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,960
little bit of background on me and again

100
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:17,450
she's counting the nods so I'll know who

101
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:19,580
does it there has always been a question

102
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">and again I'll kind of get to the notion</font>

103
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">of where this fits with information</font>

104
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,420
security in a moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you know</font>

105
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:29,750
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always been this notion of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

106
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:34,010
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to be somebody who's into data</font>

107
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:37,070
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a certain disposition</font>

108
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:41,780
again there's that basement dweller

109
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:45,530
surrounded by calculus books and you

110
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:47,599
know that's who gets into<font color="#E5E5E5"> data well the</font>

111
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,359
reality is that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

112
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,030
typical statistically the average

113
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,380
millennial will have 17 jobs or 17

114
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,979
different careers throughout the course

115
00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:04,280
of their life okay so depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

116
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:07,130
you are I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'm on number six you</font>

117
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">will undoubtedly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have been exposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

118
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,630
and use data on a regular basis to draw

119
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,450
conclusions and share<font color="#E5E5E5"> information with</font>

120
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:17,090
others<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes in an attempt to</font>

121
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:21,140
persuade them to your train of thought

122
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:23,419
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is me in a nutshell long time</font>

123
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:26,000
ago I started as a retail manager where

124
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,550
I was responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for implementing Sims</font>

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,990
strategic inventory management system

126
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:39,890
running on the ever popular as400 they

127
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:42,380
don't die it just as amazing I've walked

128
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,780
into a billion-dollar corporations and

129
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:49,130
they still have them because they don't

130
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:50,840
die<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you learn a little bit but</font>

131
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,400
the truth is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wasn't my primary job</font>

132
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,130
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> primary job was catching</font>

133
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">sixteen-year-old shoplifters as they</font>

134
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,550
tried to walk out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the door</font>

135
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:04,909
four<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars of bubble gum in their</font>

136
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:08,449
pocket<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but despite all that data</font>

137
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:12,800
played a very important role in my life

138
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:16,220
as I track and maintain market

139
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,550
researched and promote sales within my

140
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:22,190
organization again taking what I know

141
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">hacking that to produce something that I</font>

142
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:27,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know which then promote sales</font>

143
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:31,070
within the organization okay so on my

144
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:35,179
trip to data land start there and then I

145
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:36,799
become a history teacher so again as you

146
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:39,439
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your own life because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

147
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,359
just walking down<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory lane do you</font>

148
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,070
think your own life and what you've done

149
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,260
in order to get to where you are we all

150
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,880
have very different backgrounds what I'm

151
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,819
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to convey and I won't go through</font>

152
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,650
my entire life is the fact that data

153
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,700
plays a critical part in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> day-to-day</font>

154
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:59,270
affairs and as an IT security specialist

155
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:03,200
you more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more have to become</font>

156
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,310
responsible for the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you use in</font>

157
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">order to make intelligent decisions</font>

158
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:11,930
about your organization because let's be

159
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,640
realistic statistically the odds of the

160
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:18,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">basement dweller hacking your</font>

161
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:22,819
organization are pretty slim okay it's

162
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:24,560
true statistically I mean you I was in a

163
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,600
presentation earlier today where they

164
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,479
were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different methods in</font>

165
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,390
order to ensure that passwords are

166
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,640
properly hashed and continuously

167
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:39,110
rehashed to ensure they can't be hacked

168
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:41,689
someone will figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out but</font>

169
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:47,870
realistically it's not going to impact

170
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:49,160
you guys at all so ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you</font>

171
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,250
make decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your organization</font>

172
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,740
you're going to have to decide what's

173
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:57,110
important is what's not and the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

174
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,060
to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is by effectively looking at</font>

175
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,010
the data you have available and being

176
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,189
able to make intelligent decisions from

177
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,189
it

178
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:12,949
so where does this fit in information

179
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:15,378
security if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can get that to play</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">because I refuse to use the wireless</font>

200
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,939
responds to it and so he's made an

201
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:29,329
interesting living being the person who

202
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,279
responds to scam email until the point

203
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:36,020
where the scammer asks him to stop

204
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,189
emailing that's his goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I'm not</font>

205
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,899
going to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you this story because the</font>

206
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,800
truth is it's quite fun and I I think

207
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:41,360
you should watch it because he'll

208
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,180
definitely do a better job than I would

209
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">explaining it but he has multiple</font>

210
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,979
situations where he<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets scanned mail</font>

211
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,779
about you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> two million dollars in</font>

212
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,480
diamonds and all you need to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

213
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:56,600
up an account in the bank and and he

214
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,370
responds and and you know works with

215
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,290
these people until finally they can't

216
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,730
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it anymore and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this camera tells</font>

them to stop calling them or stop

218
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:08,720
emailing the point of this is the fact

219
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:12,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">that people do strange things so coming</font>

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:30,439
from my own life although I won't go

that I predict every possible outcome

255
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:14,180
and ensure that I've addressed the

256
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:18,890
reasonable ones in IT security that's

257

to talk about how you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use something</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can download the minute you</font>

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,260
talking at a hacker con and I've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

275
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,630
alluded to it the fact is is that we

276
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,460
have issues you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough staff</font>

277
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,170
you don't have the resources you need

00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,170
the job gets

279
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:32,269
here by the day and you need a map to

280
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:35,779
pick your<font color="#E5E5E5"> battles so that's why you need</font>

00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:38,209
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> become data scientists because you</font>

285
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:50,269
easier and here's why because without

00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:54,199
data opinions only<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist because lack</font>

287

right ok give me data or give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I</font>

295
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,309
just love that phrase and then without

296
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:35,750
data you're just another person with an

297
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:37,580
opinion we need data you need data to

298
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,860
pick your battle or you need more staff

299
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:46,070
and we all know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> well that argument</font>

300
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:48,229
goes over<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so in order to become data</font>

301
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:51,320
scientists and particularly good data

302

scientists you need to keep in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

303
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,790
you're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a general public</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that doesn't have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data you have it</font>

305
00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:02,629
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> own it and you get to decide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

306
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,410
we're why and when they get it so some

307
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,390
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you can walk through</font>

308
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:08,450
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am going to get at a point I</font>

309
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,860
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like talking some of the</font>

310
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,140
things we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk through are</font>

311
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:15,229
going to be those pieces that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font>

312
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,750
to help you do that and I will leave you

313
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:20,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very famous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quote on this slide</font>

314

from art pain and it comes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

315
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,830
idea that as you are the guardians of

316
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:30,890
your data and you really can decide what

317
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:33,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">you show the other people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

318
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep that ethical factor in the back of</font>

319
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,640
your head

320
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,559
so Mark Twain once said there are three

321
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,150
kinds of life there's life there's damn

lies and their statistics so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

323
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:48,580
already somewhat skeptical of data need

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:51,730
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when you're challenged</font>

325
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:54,280
with using data to manipulate people's

326
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:58,360
opinions thank you do so in an ethical

327
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:01,570
fashion<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what we're going to talk</font>

328
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:05,830
about this is like predictive analytics

329
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:07,629
machine learning 101 I'm this isn't a 12

330
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,189
hour session I'm not going to give you

331
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,409
an extensive demo that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:14,440
forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you count down the second step</font>

333
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:16,150
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> close right but I am going to make</font>

334
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that you leave here knowing</font>

335
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:20,950
tomorrow when you wake up what's

336
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,950
saturday it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> workday for IT people</font>

337
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:27,580
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that tomorrow here's</font>

338
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:29,530
what you can do to pick your battles 2

339
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,408
things we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look at supervised</font>

340
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:35,168
learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and unsupervised learning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

341
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:36,700
these two terms get thrown around a lot

342
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:39,250
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try and put them in</font>

343
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,600
layman's terms not because I concerned

344
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,820
that you can understand the technical

345
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,129
term I'm concerned I don't understand

346
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,260
the technical term so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to put</font>

347
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,510
it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> layman's terms supervised learning</font>

348
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,789
is you're predicting something you're

349
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:55,450
taking your data and you are discovering

350
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:58,990
something you don't already have okay

351
00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:00,549
unsupervised learning is you're taking

352
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:04,150
your data or you're not predicting

353
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:05,710
keeping your just grouping it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways to</font>

354
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:09,760
ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have an answer to a</font>

355
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:11,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">question you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually get to hire new</font>

356
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,980
people but you know what your last three

357
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:19,270
people stole from the company fired your

358
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:20,799
judgment is in question here so how do

359
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:26,049
you pick the right people and you've got

360
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:30,280
three files and applications I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it</font>

361
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:34,600
in less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than three minutes without</font>

362
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:37,210
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a single resume that's</font>

363
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,899
unsupervised learning and I will show

364
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:45,580
you the tool and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the particular piece in</font>

365
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,990
order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do ok let's go on to the next</font>

366
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:51,990
one

367
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:55,530
all right what you see up here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

368
00:20:51,990 --> 00:21:01,140
thinking in terms of data mining 101 is

369
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:03,690
kind of the process and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I don't</font>

370
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:07,170
know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys I hate process I</font>

371
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:09,570
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fun part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

372
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:12,540
the flag do this it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you have</font>

373
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,550
to fill out change tickets at work even

374
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:18,540
though you could do the change in eight

375
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:22,559
seconds I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

376
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can build server in minutes why does</font>

377
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:32,370
it take two and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half months anyhow</font>

378
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:34,290
unfortunately both my argument for why

379
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:40,919
we don't need process where I work<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

380
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:42,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm going to tell you you can't skip</font>

381
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:46,530
the process when it comes to data mining

382
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,840
here's why give the wrong data to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

383
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:56,610
right people at the right time and

384
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:58,740
you're screwed because they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

385
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:03,360
ever let you forget it remember that

386
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:06,929
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> mm at that time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you gave</font>

387
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">me the wrong data whoo yeah you don't to</font>

388
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:11,130
do that so you have to go through the

389
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:13,320
process and again I'm going to put the

390
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:16,800
process in layman's terms not for your

391
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:21,689
benefit for<font color="#E5E5E5"> mine first one is business</font>

392
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:24,629
understanding do not skip this part nit

393
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:26,309
insecurity in business in whatever you

394
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:28,860
do that revolves around data

395
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:33,120
particularly tons of it because we live

396
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:37,020
in a new world now storage is cheap you

397
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:42,389
can keep tons of data and companies do

398
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:45,840
some of us support it truckloads of data

399
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">about random junk that nobody will ever</font>

400
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:53,850
need but we keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's cheap</font>

401
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:58,890
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CIL calls you at 443 on</font>

402
00:22:53,850 --> 00:23:03,449
Friday and says I need to know this

403
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:05,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay here's the problem and I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

404
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:07,500
tell you you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it because he's</font>

405
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,830
gonna get real angry with you on the

406
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:13,530
phone I just need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know this hang on</font>

407
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:17,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">see I got it tell me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> specifically what</font>

408
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:22,800
you want what you're trying to show and

409
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:25,530
who the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience is going to be I'm</font>

410
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna say that again what you want who</font>

411
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,649
you're going to show or excuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> me what</font>

412
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,830
you're trying to show and who the

413
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:34,020
audience is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be 0 remember that</font>

414
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:37,139
I'm saving you heartache because when

415
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:40,170
you give him the wrong stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now 648</font>

416
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:45,360
on Friday night and he calls you back up

417
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:47,910
so that's not what I asked for yeah how

418
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sure he spells it out so in the</font>

419
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:53,220
very first phase you have to understand

420
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:54,810
business understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you need to</font>

421
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,130
know you need to stop and ask the

422
00:23:54,810 --> 00:24:00,330
critical questions because here's the

423
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:04,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">reality he don't know what to ask he</font>

424
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:06,899
knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> what he has to show and and he</font>

425
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:09,600
wants you to just blend now I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

426
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:12,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">time to talk about this just do it my</font>

427
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,350
CIO is not like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by the way so I'm</font>

428
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,360
exaggerating because i know this is

429
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:20,129
being filmed anyhow you have to make

430
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,780
sure that you understand what's going on

431
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,400
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the critical questions</font>

432
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,740
you need to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how frequently</font>

433
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,300
you want this data because it may be

434
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,920
something you could produce on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fly</font>

435
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">but not something you collect on a</font>

436
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,810
regular basis or your data collection

437
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:37,170
methods may change over time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

438
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:39,750
doing so change the deliverable you need

439
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:42,030
to understand the audience is this is

440
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,910
going to sea level management or if it's

441
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:46,649
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be presented to the board okay</font>

442
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:48,570
a little bit different if it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

443
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:53,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">be distributed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a newsletter to the</font>

444
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:56,189
shop a little bit different okay you

445
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to know the anticipated outcome and</font>

446
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,540
sometimes they don't know you have to

447
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,370
read between the lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you</font>

448
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:06,830
some use cases where that's kind of

449
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:09,049
obvious don't skip this

450
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,210
that do not get off the phone with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

451
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:14,870
guy or the lady<font color="#CCCCCC"> or whoever's asking</font>

452
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:18,529
until you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is being asked for</font>

453
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:20,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay how do you do that number one you</font>

454
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:23,450
interview people particularly the

455
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:25,309
business leaders the SMEs I've done

456
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,870
focus groups because you know again

457
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:30,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">people don't always know what they want</font>

458
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:32,418
okay surveys all that good stuff you

459
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:39,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">know get creative</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to know</font>

460
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:42,710
what's being asked so here's some

461
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:44,928
examples of the types of things that we

462
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:48,320
can be asked that you know aren't so

463
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:50,570
easy to come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love the top one</font>

464
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,840
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the most typical</font>

465
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:55,519
one that I hear your employee wants to

466
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,379
under your employer wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

467
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,269
the rate of change<font color="#E5E5E5"> in trajectory of</font>

00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:03,289
identified malware threats across the

00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:06,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">enterprise it's a logical question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

470
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:10,460
are we doing in security is it getting

00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:16,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">worse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better are you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

472
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:19,100
your job is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question under</font>

473
00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:21,110
the covers he wants to see of what

474
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,500
you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually improving</font>

475
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:26,840
maintaining our sins efficient before

476
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,419
deciding if he's going to approve those

477
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:34,039
two new<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrecks and the renewal of that</font>

478
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:36,169
software you like you have to read

479
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:38,899
between the lines you need to hire three

480
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:42,049
new security and it excuse me I didn't

481
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:44,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">write that right security analysts but</font>

482
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:46,010
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to meet strict criteria again</font>

483
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">I bring it to back the last three quit</font>

484
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:52,519
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one dude stole that guy's lunch</font>

485
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:57,229
okay we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure you're picking</font>

486
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:59,750
the right people one of your office's

487
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:03,710
has more malware threats detected than

488
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:08,539
the other what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and why</font>

489
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:12,529
haven't you caught it your company has

490
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:14,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">just acquired another you're not getting</font>

491
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:19,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">any more people</font>

492
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:21,680
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doubled in size so your CIO has</font>

493
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,510
asked for a recommendation for hardware

494
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,870
software and personnel<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ensure</font>

495
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:30,020
security is not compromised between the

496
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:31,850
lines I need you to show that you can do

497
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:36,530
it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> no additional cost to the</font>

498
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:41,179
company I love it I see all these mods

499
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:43,580
gone yeah I've heard that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

500
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:46,640
point of all that there's a

501
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:48,080
million-in-one use cases you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

502
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,260
read between the lines you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

503
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:55,580
understand the purpose so once you can

504
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:57,320
do that here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second part you</font>

505
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:01,970
probably don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to answer the</font>

506
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:04,129
question yet and you know what I've

507
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">become accustomed to not being the</font>

508
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:08,840
smartest guy in the room and I've

509
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:10,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">learned to accept it so maybe you do</font>

510
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,290
know how to answer two questions but i

511
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:14,360
can tell you seventy percent of the

512
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:17,930
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get asked when i'm asked it</font>

513
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,010
I don't know how to answer that I don't

514
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,980
know where I'm going to get the

515
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:27,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">information and it's 443 on Friday again</font>

516
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:28,670
dang<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so we need to understand the</font>

517
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,250
data that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take to answer</font>

518
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:34,040
the question what's available where do

519
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:36,890
you get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the next part of that</font>

520
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:40,670
question in what format oh I love that

521
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:43,130
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that lady on the third floor has</font>

522
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:50,690
that data on a spreadsheet on her laptop

523
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:55,760
why is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there what does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it tell you at</font>

524
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:58,250
first glance you know people say you

525
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,160
should trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> your gut as a data person I</font>

526
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,900
cringe when I say that but the truth is

527
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,000
if you know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at it the first</font>

528
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:08,690
time you can save yourself a lot of wild

529
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,910
goose chase<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay will it meet the</font>

00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">business objectives so as you think</font>

534
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,710

<font color="#CCCCCC">you guys company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but for some reason</font>

00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,360
okay the truth is excels pretty awesome

539
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,670
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use the behind-the-scenes</font>

00:30:52,680 --> 00:31:01,920
come out of that discussion GE boss how

563

you can look at on the bottom here it is

568
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:28,650
here's the number of threats distributed

569
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:30,929
across the different departments well

570
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:34,320
apparently computers electronics and the

571
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">jewelry department or they're just the</font>

572
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,120
worst

573
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,899
[Music]

574
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:42,750
you know you get all them in your

575
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:44,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer departments well we're all in</font>

576
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,620
computer departments but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

577
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:49,020
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out confess I've installed</font>

578
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:53,639
random stuff just to check it out and

579
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:55,620
you know it happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually I was the</font>

580
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,690
only one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that knew it happened but you</font>

581
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:00,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">know in large organizations particularly</font>

582
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:03,570
ones with a strong data strategy other

583
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:05,700
people will know and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course then</font>

584
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:08,429
there's also and again this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all part</font>

585
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,620
of understanding your data this is the

586
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:13,380
relationship between men and women and

587
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:18,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">the number of malware detection in their</font>

588
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:27,000
environment the red that's that's men

589
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:28,919
and then the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is women I'm just</font>

590
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna make it clear this is bogus data</font>

591
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:36,840
by the way so I didn't do that on

592
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:40,439
purpose even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> my wife is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is my</font>

593
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:43,980
number one most bothersome technical

594
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,720
support require<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but I didn't do</font>

595
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,420
that on purpose by the way ok next one

596
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:51,630
so once you've understood it you

597
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:54,210
visualized it you've drawn those initial

598
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:56,790
conclusions now you have to clean it up

599
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:59,310
eighty percent of your time is spent

600
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:02,430
doing this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> because most data is</font>

601
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:06,600
dirty and it's full<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bad stuff the</font>

602
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:10,560
bank no no I'm scary American Express as

603
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:13,709
of last year they have spent four years

604
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:15,179
building a centralized data warehouse of

605
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:27,240
both structured and unstructured data

606
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:31,320
using Hadoop<font color="#E5E5E5"> for years when I talked to</font>

607
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:34,680
their Jeep data architect I asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

608
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,060
for years man I mean what taken four

609
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,820
years he says no it's not it's not

610
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:40,260
compiling the data that's real quick you

611
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,629
know it gets really impressive you know

612
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:47,940
when you're at four and a half billion

613
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:49,010
rows like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahahaha here's but two-thirds</font>

614
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,290
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> its garbage</font>

615
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,910
and we have to go through it because if

616
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:57,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">I share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that with my CFO I'm gonna get</font>

617
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:59,810
fired for years so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font>

618
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:02,510
is the data there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there data you</font>

619
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:05,389
shouldn't use my last slide who cares

620
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:07,879
what genders involved in the most what

621
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:09,320
are you going to do ban that gender from

622
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">using the computer that's just not going</font>

623
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,270
to work I mean there's like lawsuits and

624
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:17,540
all sorts of stuff just waiting to

625
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:20,090
happen so you have to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that you</font>

626
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:26,449
remove data that doesn't contribute to

627
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:28,940
your costs are all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Antony entries</font>

628
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:30,980
logical and usable be complete most

629
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:36,050
analytics don't work with missing data

630
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:39,440
and again when you think about the tools

631
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:41,389
I mean it depends on what you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

632
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,950
your disposal you'll see that there's

633
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:44,659
two things that have a tendency<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pop</font>

634
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:49,129
up once called rapidminer the other ones

635
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:58,250
called are in our studio if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

636
00:34:49,130 --> 00:35:05,510
checked these out free download it use

637
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:08,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">it rapidminer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Gartner's 2016 big</font>

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been in the top ranking for the</font>

640
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,220
last few years I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to sell it</font>

641
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:18,830
it's free it's awesome and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look</font>

642
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:27,730
at the more commercial alternatives like

643
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:29,650
SPSS modeler and<font color="#E5E5E5"> SPSS ok I will preface</font>

644
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:33,940
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my own personal opinion I'm</font>

645
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:36,220
not meant to sway or or discredit any

646
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,369
organization but you know those things

647
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:42,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">are old they're antiquated they're hard</font>

648
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:49,990
to use it look like they're built in the

649
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:54,939
90s<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so great tool by the way dude</font>

650
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:57,549
with the camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah so they're all</font>

651
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:59,140
perfectly good acceptable huge parts of

652
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:01,869
the everyday data mining community

653
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">however if you want something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

654
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:05,920
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can use in your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

655
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,020
organization to answer the 443 question

656
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:14,560
from the CIO use rapidminer it's awesome

657
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:16,660
all right next one cleaning your data ok

658
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,340
on the right hand side you see a screen

659
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,750
of what rapidminer looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

660
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,850
right now there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the</font>

661
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:24,609
arts going<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have time to do this</font>

662
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:26,380
I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time I don't have the</font>

663
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:34,690
interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> to three people walking out the</font>

664
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:36,280
back door we see you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I don't</font>

665
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:37,780
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to do this and I'm certainly</font>

666
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:42,520
not going through that spreadsheet on

667
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:46,000
the left<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I can't do 77,000 rows of</font>

668
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:48,130
that stuff ok this is what rapidminer

669
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,440
looks like it's also what SPSS modeler

670
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:53,770
it looks like in other tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

671
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,920
can use for these purposes all of them

672
00:36:53,770 --> 00:37:00,009
are certainly exceptional again rapid

673
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:03,070
minus free well because their next time

674
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:05,200
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> things work but what you'll</font>

675
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:07,600
see is that it's a series of operational

676
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:12,160
modules that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can include in order to</font>

677
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:16,089
manipulate your data over time so coming

678
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:18,129
back no what's being asked get the data

679
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:20,859
that you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> however you need to get it</font>

680
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:25,450
clean that data so that it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> functional</font>

681
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:27,970
and then the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> step is the actual fun</font>

682
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:29,618
part so by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this point you're exhausted</font>

683
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,910
and you can't take it anymore and you

684
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:33,400
know now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's time to do the fun part</font>

685
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:38,290
this is where we get to the modeling

686
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:41,050
piece in case everybody's wondering what

687
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,270
that means and again I keep trying to

688
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,100
tie

689
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:45,170
back to security but the reality is is

690
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:50,000
universal for anybody who arcs with data

691
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:51,860
particularly a large amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay when</font>

692
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">you talk about modeling you're talking</font>

693
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:57,170
about taking your data to draw a new

694
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:59,779
conclusion that perhaps isn't obvious in

695
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:02,390
the first place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're going to do</font>

696
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:04,550
that by grouping it or you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

697
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:08,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that by using what you know to</font>

698
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:13,790
predict what you don't the mathematical

699
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:18,440
equations behind it I've looked at them

700
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:22,279
I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get them and then this is my</font>

701
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:24,200
own confession I do some of them I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

702
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:29,420
even know how to describe that equation

703
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:31,879
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some calculus guy at you</font>

704
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,530
know at Harvard you know threw up one

705
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:38,390
night and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it looks like so</font>

706
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:40,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I understand what I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get and</font>

707
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,990
I understand which of those calculations

708
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,670
is going to get me there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

709
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:47,390
understand the tools that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

710
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:48,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">use to do it so in this point we're</font>

711
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:51,230
getting to the modeling part we've done

712
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:53,540
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dirty work using whatever tool</font>

00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:55,460
suits us including you know the more

714
00:38:53,540 --> 00:39:03,050
commercial ones which I prefer other

715
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:04,520
ones good the modeling pieces is the

716
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:06,290
part you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to that's the</font>

717
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:10,220
question or the answer to the question

718
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:13,730
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been given so in this case here's</font>

719
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:17,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">your malware threats over time the</font>

720
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:22,700
question is well how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we doing well</font>

721
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:24,590
it's not our fault you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know people just</font>

722
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:31,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep introducing new malware into the</font>

723
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:32,900
world those darn basement bowlers are

724
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,990
you keeping track of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:39,440
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always for all I can beat that</font>

726
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:41,299
anyhow now where's going up but the

727
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,580
question is where will we be in the

728
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:48,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">future i know where i am now it's too</font>

729
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:51,920
late can't fix that it crashed<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

730
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:53,030
minutes ago where are we going to be in

731
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:58,160
the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all we want to know</font>

732
00:39:53,030 --> 00:40:02,930
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> black friday of 2017 survive</font>

733
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:05,029
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to know so i need to</font>

734
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:07,069
use predictive analytics and modeling to

735
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:12,890
do it in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've stretched out</font>

736
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:14,840
the reality out another 120 days and you

737
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:20,690
are adding new malware to your

738
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:25,910
environment at a rate of one every<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

739
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:27,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">days so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we continue to go down the</font>

740
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:31,940
rate we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

741
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,319
bigger problems we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can model this we can</font>

742
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,880
model it with a certain degree of

743
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,220
accuracy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can even tell you how to</font>

744
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,290
get to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> accuracy so we've done the</font>

745
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:43,100
hard work we've done the model excellent

746
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:44,779
there's other modeling tool kits that

747
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,160
you can use if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take any</font>

748
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:49,790
notes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you haven't fallen asleep yet</font>

749
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,470
this is the gold right<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

750
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:53,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">the stuff that when you get back</font>

751
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:55,220
tomorrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you've you've rethought of</font>

752
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:58,220
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you learned over the last</font>

753
00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:01,370
two days and you think what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the crazy</font>

754
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:03,410
data guy talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know there's</font>

755
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:06,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">Friday night and the borrower's going to</font>

756
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:08,180
close this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember</font>

757
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:10,430
because because this is the stuff that

758
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:13,640
it takes people<font color="#CCCCCC"> years to figure out and</font>

759
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:15,410
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to tell you there's two</font>

760
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,509
things we've talked about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

761
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:20,660
supervised and unsupervised learning

762
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:24,170
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's forget those terms you want</font>

763
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:27,529
to classify stuff these are the ones you

764
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:29,450
do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> your three thousand applicants and</font>

765
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:33,380
you have to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top five and i need</font>

766
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:38,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">it by Thursday at noon this is how you</font>

767
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:41,480
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> k means predict k k like in most</font>

768
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:43,040
things is in a relevant number

769
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,400
what it's basically saying is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

770
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:50,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your stuff and I'm going to</font>

771
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:55,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">group it into logical groupings and you</font>

772
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,660
can pick the group you like best if you

773
00:41:55,070 --> 00:42:00,950
look right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right hand side i</font>

774
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:03,560
did it i took 1,000 applicants all with

775
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:06,859
different characteristics and I picked

776
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:11,090
the 100 that makes sense and the rest

777
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:14,210
get I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> no thank you letters how</font>

778
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:17,300
did I do that well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only want the ones</font>

779
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:18,440
with the most years of training I want

780
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,470
the ones with the most sophisticated

781
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:24,590
certifications I want the ones with the

782
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:26,390
longest work history I want the ones

783
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:28,790
that have passed our background<font color="#CCCCCC"> check</font>

784
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:33,049
and scored the highest on our screening

785
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:36,770
surveys I can't go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that</font>

786
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:38,630
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in less than three minutes and</font>

787
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:40,280
I'm exaggerating and the truth is it

788
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:43,400
just takes seconds for a thousand I

789
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:47,240
already know this is the group<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

790
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:50,600
and I know there's a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

791
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:53,810
I'm not reading more than a hundred so I

792
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:58,970
broke it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten groups and I'm picking</font>

793
00:42:53,810 --> 00:43:05,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best group now I can go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on and solve</font>

794
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:11,240
all those other problems go back not yet

795
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:15,109
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things with k-means it is</font>

796
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:19,759
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left-hand side you</font>

797
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:23,270
can see it this is the process i'm going

798
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:27,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to read my data i'm going to select the</font>

799
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:29,390
relevant data i am going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose the</font>

800
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:31,250
role in other words when I choose the

801
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:35,660
role I'm deciding what's the one that I

802
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:37,460
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me and then I'm</font>

803
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:43,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to run the clustering module and</font>

804
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:43,450
like magic it spits out what I want

805
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:56,730
all right now you can go on yes basement

806
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:59,099
hey yeah as you add to that classify our

807
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:02,160
group another one's called k-nearest

808
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:03,960
neighbor in k-nearest neighbor you take

809
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,480
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> your data you let the computer group</font>

810
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,660
it you find the ones that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

811
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:13,650
answered like what will this new one go

812
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:15,450
to Group a group B and the calculation

813
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:20,010
will determine that based on distance

814
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:23,279
from the team number of variables you

815
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:26,369
choose to compare it to so<font color="#CCCCCC"> in other</font>

816
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:30,390
words if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a thousand records 500</font>

817
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:32,760
or over here 497 over here I've got

818
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:37,290
three left and I want you to divide the

819
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:42,810
three into whichever group is closest by

820
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:44,849
three individuals it'll do it it'll tell

821
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:49,589
you who will get picked last for

822
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:53,070
kickball next door on decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> tree</font>

823
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:56,700
these rock I mean these are awesome if

824
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:58,200
you and I know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw the first</font>

825
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,500
slide I used to be a history teacher so

826
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:04,259
I run this against the Titanic data to

827
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:08,490
see who would have survived and not and

828
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:11,970
why they died it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really more of it I'm</font>

829
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:16,439
really ashamed of myself but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> truth</font>

830
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:20,399
is statistically I'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get there</font>

831
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:22,410
in nineteen 414 so much for the history

832
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,630
teacher I'd love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be there before they</font>

833
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:29,279
get on and run around and go dude don't

834
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:34,140
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the boat it's not going to end</font>

835
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:37,440
well because you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> determine quite</font>

836
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:44,759
precisely who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to die and why</font>

837
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:48,869
it's cool and moral bit yes I'm ashamed

838
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:51,390
anyhow in addition the decision trees

839
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:54,359
nit this is totally awesome i love it

840
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:56,609
you can take that statistical analytics

841
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:57,060
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> build rules and we do this</font>

842
00:45:56,609 --> 00:45:59,430
it

843
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,520
totally awesome because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what a</font>

844
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:04,620
high amount of CPU memory or disk

845
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,830
utilization on a system is not

846
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:09,779
necessarily bad can you give me what you

847
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:14,040
paid for that thing was expensive you

848
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:16,590
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> working at heart but when a</font>

849
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:19,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain combination of events occurs it</font>

850
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:22,200
always results in something bad nobody

851
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:25,680
knows to watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this this this and</font>

852
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,569
this statistically I can tell you what

853
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,580
to watch for create rules for it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

854
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:34,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">mood at those flags pop up you get a</font>

855
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:37,770
phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> call how cool is that call me when</font>

856
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:46,649
a real problem is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen that's</font>

857
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:48,000
a unique concept naive Bayes I don't

858
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:51,000
know our babies came from but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll tell</font>

859
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">you why it's called naive it's called</font>

860
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,750
naive because it makes the assumption

861
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,470
that all variables in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> equation are</font>

862
00:46:54,750 --> 00:47:00,870
independent<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the truth is they're</font>

863
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:05,160
not always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nice thing about naive</font>

864
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:09,839
Bayes it always works even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your data</font>

865
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:13,410
is flawed it just seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work so this</font>

866
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:17,280
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your tool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kit for clustering next one</font>

867
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:20,910
oh man nobody saw out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their chair yet</font>

868
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,460
so when you use your tool kit you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

869
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:25,049
also use predictors so forget the

870
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,970
clustering we just talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about we're</font>

871
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:30,720
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> all our data and grouping it to</font>

872
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:32,580
draw some conclusion well not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question</font>

873
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,470
is well I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to draw a</font>

874
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:36,210
conclusion I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> variable I just</font>

875
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:39,959
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when bad things are going</font>

876
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:42,930
to happen and that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use our</font>

877
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:46,650
predictors particularly linear and

878
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:52,919
logistic regression here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my plug for</font>

879
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:59,970
our this to do all this is one line of

880
00:47:52,920 --> 00:48:04,380
code in arms<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay totally awesome but if</font>

881
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:06,990
you like the boxes you can use SPSS you

882
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:09,000
can use SPSS modeler you can use SAS you

883
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:09,348
can use rapidminer all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

884
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,839
their

885
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:14,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">built-in for logistic and and linear</font>

886
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:18,049
regression if you look at the bottom

887
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:20,779
right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it does it takes the</font>

888
00:48:18,049 --> 00:48:23,269
data you have it determines a reasonable

889
00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:27,170
statistical trend and forecasted<font color="#CCCCCC"> out as</font>

890
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:29,930
far as you want to go the difference

891
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:34,069
between linear and logistic linear works

892
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:37,249
with numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay logistic works with</font>

893
00:48:34,069 --> 00:48:43,249
yes or no will you died on the Titanic

894
00:48:37,249 --> 00:48:47,058
logistic how many days do you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> left</font>

895
00:48:43,249 --> 00:48:52,910
to live on the Titanic well yeah sorry

896
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:58,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">not many all right next one all right</font>

897
00:48:52,910 --> 00:49:01,279
we're almost done next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one we've done</font>

898
00:48:58,489 --> 00:49:03,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the work right we got the request we</font>

899
00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:07,400
determine what was asked we identified

900
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:09,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I needed to collect we cleaned it</font>

901
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:12,229
up and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> even did the fun part the</font>

902
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:16,339
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but it has to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pass</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the smell</font>

904
00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:22,940
to somebody I mean they never turn out

905
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:28,308
right the first time okay it has to pass

906
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:32,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">the smell test have you ever done p2v</font>

907
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:35,960
migration analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's a disaster</font>

908
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:41,900
right your model eight year old hardware

909
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:44,420
on two brand new next-gen blades they go

910
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:48,259
from a hundred and twenty-eight CPU down

911
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:49,519
to eight and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hand them at me look at</font>

912
00:49:48,259 --> 00:49:52,279
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your girl horn out your</font>

913
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:56,839
forehead that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible well</font>

914
00:49:52,279 --> 00:49:59,150
statistically it is ok but it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

915
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:01,729
pass<font color="#E5E5E5"> the smell test you have to look at</font>

916
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:02,989
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure it's right and</font>

917
00:50:01,729 --> 00:50:09,618
the way you do that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

918
00:50:02,989 --> 00:50:18,250
next slide my accuracy look at at my

919
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:23,110
Titanic people 45.6 seven percent

920
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:26,680
oh yeah we might as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well guess a 50-50</font>

921
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:31,540
shot anyway never comes out right the

922
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:33,009
first time sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> white is going to come</font>

923
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:35,890
out right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the first time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

924
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:37,660
it you include everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

925
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:40,900
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> which variables are important</font>

926
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:43,690
at which art keep in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best way</font>

927
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:46,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the best but the simplest way to</font>

928
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:50,710
determine accuracy is using a confusion

929
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:52,210
matrix I love that term yeah it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

930
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,800
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> make any sense how do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

931
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:57,670
if you're right well you check the

932
00:50:53,800 --> 00:51:00,040
confusion matrix<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh my sounds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a bad</font>

933
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:01,510
joke and basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it does is it</font>

934
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,630
says well look i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take the</font>

935
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:06,970
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of predicted true and the number</font>

936
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:09,460
of real true and see how close<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

937
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:10,660
and the number of predicted false and

938
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,390
the number of real<font color="#E5E5E5"> falls and see how</font>

939
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:16,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">close you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are most tools do this for you</font>

940
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:17,319
rapidminer it has a module and I keep

941
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:20,109
coming back to it because you can go

942
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:22,030
home and download it when we're done has

943
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:25,570
a module called performance it'll tell

944
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:30,460
you if it's less than ninety five

945
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:34,210
percent accurate no yeah cool for that

946
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:36,550
and you hand that off to your boss<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

947
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:40,750
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> if fifty percent accurate that that's</font>

948
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:43,150
yeah no don't use that so make sure it's

949
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:46,480
accurate before you send it on all right

950
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:48,730
next last part once you've done it

951
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,470
you've done all of that stuff he hit to

952
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:54,370
the point it's time to deploy it put it

953
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:57,129
in production that's when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hand it</font>

954
00:51:54,370 --> 00:52:00,490
off to your boss<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna recap too</font>

955
00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:03,220
quickly you started out with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

956
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:05,500
critical question you get them all the

957
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:09,370
time more and more if you don't get data

958
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:13,600
related questions now can I come work by

959
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:18,339
you because it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all I get but</font>

960
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:20,620
that's kind of my job but it's all data

961
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:22,510
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> more money show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data you</font>

962
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:24,609
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> more people show me the data you</font>

963
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:30,450
don't want to get fired because the bank

964
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:30,450
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Singapore went down show me the data</font>

965
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:37,799
you need to use data to help people draw

966
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:41,190
accurate conclusions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> insecurity you</font>

967
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:43,380
have to do it too this is the process if

968
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:44,340
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow this process and you use one</font>

969
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:48,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the tools that you have available</font>

970
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:53,610
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you walk in there and they say hey</font>

971
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:55,410
how's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it doing how's it going are we</font>

972
00:52:53,610 --> 00:53:00,780
still having security threats on the

973
00:52:55,410 --> 00:53:02,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">East Coast yeah the please ghost what do</font>

974
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:07,590
you do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that's why we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all live</font>

975
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:10,500
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Midwest all right I have anything</font>

976
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:13,590
after that no that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

977
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:15,240
come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last thing I want</font>

978
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">to wrap this all up in a bow for you</font>

979
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:21,419
because you know there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> no hash</font>

980
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:23,490
algorithms I love group policy but a

981
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:26,970
group policy rocks but I'm sorry there's

982
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:29,729
no group policy in my discussion it all

983
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:34,049
comes down to once the hackers are done

984
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:36,780
once you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have manipulated change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

985
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:40,410
gained access to something in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to</font>

986
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:44,040
gain new insights well then what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

987
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:46,529
do then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the data and oftentimes</font>

988
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:48,509
the data is something that your boss

989
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:50,250
your boss's boss are worse yet your

990
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:52,530
boss's boss's boss so she<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

991
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:54,870
shouldn't even know who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are will</font>

992
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:57,300
come right to you and ask for the data

993
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:59,490
and you have to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to deliver it</font>

994
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:02,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a way that is both accurate and</font>

995
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:05,069
provides direction for the next steps

996
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:07,830
this is how you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you follow</font>

997
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:10,620
these steps you're going to be

998
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:13,710
successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if the answer is not</font>

999
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:37,940
what they want to hear so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

1000
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:37,940
any questions yes hi wells great next

1001
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,310
[Music]

1002
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:46,350
[Applause]

1003
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:49,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">I figure if i don't talk long enough</font>

1004
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:50,490
you'll forget you<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked the question the</font>

1005
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:54,270
truth is I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

1006
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:57,419
it's a very legitimate point and he's

1007
00:54:54,270 --> 00:55:01,770
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem statistical analysis</font>

1008
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:04,050
is not is ancient so everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

1009
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:06,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">just talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the computerized</font>

1010
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:08,940
version of intelligence<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in some</font>

1011
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:14,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases date back to the ancient Greeks</font>

1012
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:18,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is not new having a machine</font>

1013
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:20,790
do it and do it with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of</font>

1014
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:27,690
accuracy that makes human interaction

1015
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:29,400
less and less needed that's new so the

1016
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:32,040
only thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can say to that question is</font>

1017
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:36,450
that it's part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an expected learning</font>

1018
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:40,650
curve as those types of situations arise

1019
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:42,810
the algorithms and the people who

1020
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:46,590
produce the tools to use those

1021
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:48,540
algorithms have to mature with it I know

1022
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:52,440
that's a real cop-out answer because I

1023
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:57,210
you know but that's what I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1024
00:55:52,440 --> 00:56:01,680
other questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright I appreciate</font>

1025
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:03,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone's time I hope that a little bit</font>

1026
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,980
of data talk didn't bore you too much

1027
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,110
everybody have a great evening and

1028
