14
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,390
cybersecurity starter kit how to talk to

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,539
your businesses about improving security

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,940
I work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a company called concurrency</font>

17
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their I'm a solutions architect my</font>

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,890
job is to basically come up with new

19
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,510
solutions for our customers and lately

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,739
it's been about security right security

21
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,510
is everywhere I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security</font>

22
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,669
background which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty convenient</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

23
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,230
also i'm an enterprise security MVP

24
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,940
which if you haven't heard about the MVP

25
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,470
program that's probably because it's a

26
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,759
microsoft thing and that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

27
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,860
popular over here but we talked with

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,290
businesses who run Windows and Windows

29
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,479
servers and in the enterprise security

30
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,710
program I get the opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font>

31
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people inside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Microsoft</font>

32
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,119
about the products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and solutions that</font>

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,699
they work with and help them with

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,820
feedback from our customers and do

35
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:30,210
improvements on how those things work so

36
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,979
accent currency we basically help

37
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,979
customers transform their businesses by

38
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,270
investing more in the products that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

39
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,039
already own doing better salute of

40
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,579
deployments and configurations of those

41
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,950
of those tools and when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

42
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,048
security the conversations that I have

43
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,390
with our customers often times come down

44
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,460
to I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do you know</font>

45
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,259
others I know that we're at risk I know

46
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,089
that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better but</font>

47
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not totally sure where to start and</font>

48
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,280
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those businesses frankly don't</font>

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,110
have the budget or the staff to deal

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,399
with it and so what they're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us</font>

51
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,290
with is this question of like what

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,259
should we do it feels pretty ambiguous

53
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,869
and so what I wanted to do is put

54
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,300
together a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of slides and</font>

55
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,720
presentation on how to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

56
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,430
I want to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so</font>

57
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,650
examples that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

58
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,570
businesses<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk with the the people</font>

59
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">there about what they can do and</font>

60
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:25,000
actually give you some examples that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

61
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,640
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take back i also want to show you</font>

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,800
four areas that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font>

63
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,440
immediately start making changes in the

64
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,270
business based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks that I think</font>

65
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,440
taking some mitigation steps will help

66
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:40,780
improve the security very quickly so if

67
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,410
you've seen information is beautiful

68
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,930
they do a good job of showing a lot of

69
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:50,140
data in a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> way this shows records</font>

70
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,870
shows breaches that have resulted<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

71
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,940
loss of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30,000 records or more and in</font>

72
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,890
just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years there's so many</font>

73
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,459
of them that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's basically just a big</font>

74
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:03,579
blob on the screen and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we switch the</font>

75
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:06,160
coloring to show the kinds of breaches

76
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,810
that occur on here the pink ones are

77
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,240
basically all hats right deliberate

78
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">circumvention of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security to steal these</font>

79
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,610
records and this tells me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's not</font>

80
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,609
necessarily someone just being lazy and

81
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,170
configuring something in an open way it

82
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">oftentimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that right</font>

83
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,040
somebody did something wrong and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

84
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,510
very easy to circumvent a system but the

85
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,709
deliberate hacks is the things that

86
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:31,510
people are really concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

87
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:33,250
rightly so right and afterwards when the

88
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,690
companies have been hitting the

89
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,040
headlines and they find out that yeah

90
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,810
we've been recently lost a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

91
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff this is this is what I think they</font>

92
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,959
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like right I don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

93
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,840
feel this<font color="#CCCCCC"> way my customers don't want to</font>

94
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,970
feel this way so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need to</font>

95
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">start doing something about it and what</font>

96
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,980
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do is first realize that yeah we</font>

97
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,630
can do better than what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing and</font>

98
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,429
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a lot of times there's a shame</font>

99
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,260
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that realization right</font>

100
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,790
like on man our security is really bad

101
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,640
let's not talk about it maybe it'll go

102
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:03,310
away and so many times that head in the

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,600
sand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that turtling is what companies</font>

104
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,720
have been doing and it's starting to

105
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,519
catch up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us so once you can admit</font>

106
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can do better you can then</font>

107
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize that we can always do better and</font>

108
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,048
there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> really wrong with the</font>

109
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,340
fact that you can do better you know if

110
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:17,470
you have a company with no security

111
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,180
practice then maybe it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

112
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,859
one if you already have a security

113
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,490
practice then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably still</font>

114
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:26,440
build on that so when you start taking

115
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">this path you have to kind of stop</font>

116
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,759
talking about

117
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,800
and start doing it right you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

118
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,470
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a plan and start executing against</font>

119
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,599
it so when you're starting out you

120
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a team you want to</font>

121
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:39,080
involve people because if it's if it's

122
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,370
you at your desk knowing that security

123
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,810
sucks and you don't talk to people about

124
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,849
it you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do anything about</font>

125
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,949
it and you need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure to involve</font>

126
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:48,770
the right people<font color="#CCCCCC"> you involve not only</font>

127
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:51,050
the IT folks because I IT is not the

128
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">only aspect of security we're talking</font>

129
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:56,000
about business process we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

130
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the implementations of your the</font>

131
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,479
products<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're delivering we're</font>

132
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,180
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about culture in the</font>

133
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:05,120
organization all of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> commit or</font>

134
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,849
contribute to the security culture of

135
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,590
the organization and rather than

136
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,940
starting from scratch and figuring this

137
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,128
all out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your own you should really</font>

138
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,620
stand on the shoulders of giants right

139
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:18,169
you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> frameworks out there like</font>

140
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NIST CSF that is a really good</font>

141
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:22,008
reference for the kinds of things that

142
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,669
you can pay attention to so if you look

150
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,770
process you do do you you know make a

151
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:45,440
bad practice of doing wire transfers

152
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,900
without you know without securing that

153
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,319
information and then how do you protect

154
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:53,210
those asset is there you know

155
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,949
configurations and firewalls is their

156
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,138
certificates what can you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> two sticks</font>

157
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:58,639
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> or to protect it and if something</font>

158
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:02,060
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong how do you detect that and</font>

159
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,650
once it goes wrong how do you respond to

160
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">it who do you need to call to bring in</font>

161
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,339
to either get those services back online

162
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,379
who has to deal with public relations

163
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:10,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so there's a whole myriad of</font>

164
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:12,650
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deal with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

165
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:14,629
for each of these including recovery and

166
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,310
once you can do the recovery sometimes

167
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:18,620
that means not just bringing the

168
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,870
services back online but also kind of

169
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,150
repairing your image right so there's a

170
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,750
whole variety of things that it gets

171
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:29,599
involved with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security practice but</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NIF CSF itself is not a standard</font>

173
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:33,229
right it's not something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

174
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,630
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and become CSF certified it</font>

175
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:37,909
is based on standards so if you're

00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to meet standards for things like</font>

audits

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,250
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nest GSF references most of those</font>

179
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,380
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of standards and gives deliberate</font>

180
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,930
or gives direct guidance on the things

181
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,250
to do to meet those<font color="#E5E5E5"> standards but the</font>

182
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,380
nice thing is that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

183
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,759
specific to any industry right it was

originally created<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help protect</font>

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,160
like the power grid and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:03,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">country needed to stay afloat not just</font>

188
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,000
the business but the recommendations

00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:09,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are inside the frameworks are still</font>

190
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,080
relevant to multiple industries so to

191
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,000
get specific we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically have to call</font>

192
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,130
out what we're concerned with what is it

193
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,820
that has us up at night what is it that

194
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:21,560
we think is really at risk it's a good

195
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,940
place to start because it probably means

196
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,210
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you know that</font>

197
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,550
needs to be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when you realize</font>

198
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,638
what it is you can start calling out why

199
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,530
it's bad what is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would go where</font>

200
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,770
what would happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business if</font>

201
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:39,258
this thing was exploited and and start

202
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,490
making out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that list and once you have a</font>

203
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,199
list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that you're concerned</font>

204
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">with really start with the little things</font>

205
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,440
below hanging fruit the things that you

206
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,109
can start making<font color="#E5E5E5"> that small incremental</font>

207
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,550
change that is a measurable thing you

208
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,159
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to demonstrate</font>

209
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,539
improvement not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a gut feeling that</font>

210
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:56,030
something is<font color="#E5E5E5"> better but something</font>

211
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:58,699
tangible because once you can start

212
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:01,219
seeing the past series of improvements

213
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:02,570
you can start really seeing that trend

214
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,770
going to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business to start making</font>

215
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:09,320
making things better and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're not</font>

216
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,659
sure where to start this might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a list</font>

217
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,759
of things to consider if you're a

218
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:15,349
service provider you know look at denial

219
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,509
of service attacks and botnets like if

220
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:20,270
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a providing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> services on a web</font>

221
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:22,280
portal could<font color="#E5E5E5"> you handle like the</font>

222
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,870
Internet of Things turning on you right

223
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">like what happened with that within DNS</font>

224
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:29,360
is it possible that someone in your

225
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,400
organization could be tricked by social

226
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,860
engineering I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that everybody</font>

227
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,899
would agree yeah like it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font>

228
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,450
whether that's through an malicious

229
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:40,190
email attachment or maybe it's somebody

230
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,839
with a nice-looking badge that walks up

231
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">with says hey I'm the IT guy and I need</font>

232
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,660
to update the<font color="#CCCCCC"> certificate side your</font>

233
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,790
computer guy just plug this in real

234
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,230
quick is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible that so many</font>

235
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,380
organization would believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and let</font>

236
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen it's</font>

237
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,939
it's very likely in many organizations

238
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,470
and ransomware if if you did get

239
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,880
malicious payload and it were to go

240
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,620
through and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know give you some</font>

241
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,080
cryptolocker or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lackey or something is</font>

242
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it likely to spread and cause</font>

243
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,500
damage to business<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if it did how</font>

244
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,740
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> you come back food do you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

245
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,770
plan and credential that this is the one

246
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,600
that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is by and large the most</font>

247
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:17,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">well-known problem in most businesses</font>

248
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:20,610
today is related to credential theft so

249
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:22,770
among these things insider threats are

250
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,030
real right but when you're starting a

251
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,850
security practice I would really

252
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,020
recommend you do not start there does

253
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,580
anyone know<font color="#E5E5E5"> why you wouldn't start with</font>

254
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,880
an insider threat why I would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

255
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:36,510
it's a big room nobody wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say I</font>

256
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,160
would say not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start with an insider</font>

257
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,020
threat because if you are beginning the

258
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,819
security practice first you're going to

259
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,110
make mistakes right you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done it</font>

260
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be figuring it</font>

261
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,130
out and the and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that you</font>

262
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,380
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want the first mistake to be does</font>

263
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,540
you saying hey IT guy I don't trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

264
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,640
to stay out of my email yeah I don't

265
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust you to stay out of the stuff you</font>

266
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,930
shouldn't be in you don't want to put

267
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,099
out their sense of non trust right you

268
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,959
want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're building</font>

269
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">an organization of trust good</font>

270
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,560
relationships and you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

271
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that have the administrative</font>

272
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,229
rights in the end the power in the

273
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,240
organization to make these changes and

274
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,250
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people you inherently</font>

275
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,800
trust right now and they're not the ones

276
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,200
that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> defend against at least</font>

277
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the outset right eventually you can</font>

278
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,620
start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the risk of insider</font>

279
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,660
threats but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the beginning you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

280
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">start making improvements very easily</font>

281
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">that address the external threats</font>

282
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,329
eventually once you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting better</font>

283
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,950
at it you have an actual security

284
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,660
practice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was standards</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff in</font>

285
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,340
place then you can start looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at some</font>

you're going to foster that mistrust in

00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:43,230
the organization you really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

specific things to look at related to

those kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of risks and threats you</font>

294
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,040
might look at things like your network

301
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,070
that's that segmentation doesn't always

the heartbleed or something like that

320
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:41,030
taking a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at those those libraries</font>

321
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,460
and patching is kind of an obvious one

322
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,569
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think of but many times I go</font>

323
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,380
into organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that don't really</font>

00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:49,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a strict man that method of doing</font>

325
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,439
the deployments you know we kind of do

326
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,730
it quarterly we kind of do it when you

327
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,110
get around to it you know if a patch

328
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,210
happens to get installed and I guess it

329
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,620
gets installed and we tried our already

330
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:00,230
p to everything to do it manually that's

331
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,450
not a good way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to manage patches and it</font>

332
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,610
causes lots and lots of problems because

333
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">exploiting those kinds of</font>

334
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,210
vulnerabilities is not that hard anymore

335
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,770
right I mean this is probably the right

336
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:14,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asks anybody heard of metasploit</font>

337
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:15,620
right how easy is it to inject in it and

338
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,090
a payload and a vulnerability right you

339
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,750
go to the library<font color="#E5E5E5"> you choose it and then</font>

340
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:23,120
you deploy it so patching is actually a

341
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,740
very big deal that people think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

342
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,810
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fine because we'll just go to a</font>

343
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,720
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> pack 2 or something but it's a</font>

344
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,339
terrible idea and excessive privileges

345
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,960
is another very big one to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

346
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,700
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to just start</font>

347
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting domain admin rights to every</font>

348
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,330
service account because it just probably

349
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,790
needs it or at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least gets me over the</font>

350
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,350
hump and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then they leave it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as as that</font>

351
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,390
and if you can find a<font color="#CCCCCC"> service account</font>

352
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,920
running as a service on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

353
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,170
that is the that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a gold mine right</font>

354
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,640
you jump on that box still the creds and

355
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,219
how you're done you just want and

356
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,650
credential management falls into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

357
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,660
too if you are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good job on</font>

358
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:59,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">allowing users to do things like manage</font>

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,670
their own passwords and use credentials

360
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,380
or require credentials that are harder

361
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:06,439
to crack then we've been talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

362
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,850
that all day once you've gone through

363
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,190
this list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start building out</font>

364
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,660
things like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the the services</font>

365
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,550
that are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your environment you need to</font>

366
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,860
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> care of start making the literal</font>

367
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,260
list

368
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,760
this list one of the most important

369
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,880
columns on here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually that owner</font>

370
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,279
column if you can define the owners of

371
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,700
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> service in your organization that is</font>

372
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,459
going to drive progress if you say pull

373
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,010
IT owns this or finance owns this

374
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:33,869
nobody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be responsible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for it</font>

375
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:36,600
and nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to have to answer</font>

376
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:38,220
when the timeline slips so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about</font>

377
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,200
accountability and making sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

378
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,910
set realistic goals and you have

379
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,410
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who can make a decision now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

380
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saying that's empirical right you're</font>

381
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">not going to go and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just say this is how</font>

382
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,480
it is because I own it you know you

383
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,829
still probably have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and right</font>

384
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,029
we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting trust from</font>

385
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:56,219
people and once they have that owner set

386
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:58,260
you can start doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like defining</font>

387
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,740
what is the threat what could happen if

388
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:04,560
this particular item was exploited and

389
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,420
then the vulnerability is what could

390
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,010
cause it so if we're we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

391
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">like privilege escalation being the</font>

392
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,510
wrist local administrators could cause

393
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,820
privilege escalation so that is the

394
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:18,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerability and then controls what can</font>

395
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,490
you do to prevent that risk once you

396
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">have those categorized then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font>

397
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,380
you'd start saying well what is the

398
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,540
impact for how bad could that be like is

399
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take down a web</font>

400
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,319
server or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to own my entire</font>

401
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,569
domain like<font color="#E5E5E5"> how bad is it and this is</font>

402
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,449
kind of subjected you get to classify

403
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,790
this how you like risk is more how

404
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:41,819
likely is that to happen like sure if

405
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,560
this happened everything could break but

406
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,269
the likelihood of it happening is pretty

407
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,219
small because of these controls we have

408
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:49,829
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> place so it might be a little</font>

409
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,019
likelihood but a high impact right and

410
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:53,729
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last is complexity this is</font>

411
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:55,709
where you you think of if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to</font>

412
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,440
implement this mitigation technique how

413
00:14:55,709 --> 00:15:00,719
hard would it be<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much time and</font>

414
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,670
resources product solutions or whatever

415
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,980
it might take to do how complexes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

416
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:07,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">to play and with those three metrics you</font>

417
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,290
can start building your priority you can

<font color="#E5E5E5">start getting the right people in place</font>

425
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:29,939
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on next</font>

426
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:33,630
this is probably the most controversial

427
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:36,450
slide in the deck because the idea is

428
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:39,390
that you might need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to prove that that</font>

429
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,710
risk is real and i'm not saying you

430
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,819
should go rogue in your organization

431
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,980
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> start hacking all the things</font>

432
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,440
because it's fun this is actually very

433
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,240
dangerous to do if you don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

434
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">it but you might find yourself in a</font>

435
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,730
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you need to prove that</font>

436
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:56,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">this risk is real and when you do that</font>

437
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,930
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to record what you did but you</font>

438
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,980
have to remember that did not do any

439
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:03,209
harm<font color="#E5E5E5"> here there are other tips that you</font>

440
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,820
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through and make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

441
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,890
you basically get some permissions

442
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,420
whoever might you might have to report

443
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,920
to to say hey I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need to do this</font>

444
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,900
this is what I want to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

445
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,089
risk it shouldn't do anything because

446
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,490
you know the bounds of what you're going

447
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,830
to work in but you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> even go so far</font>

448
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,330
as to hire a pen test I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a pen</font>

449
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,610
testers anybody at pentester in here

450
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,990
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys you can hire these guys to</font>

451
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,570
come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and help you figure out what's</font>

452
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:31,590
wrong right and they can prove it for

453
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:33,900
you and if you if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to do</font>

454
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">some social experiments you know try and</font>

455
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,410
trick somebody into changing your

456
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,939
passwords don't go in there and say hey

457
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,290
I'm Joe from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IT department I want</font>

458
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,180
you to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the buses password and</font>

459
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,980
they say haha I tricked you it doesn't

460
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">work like that you're trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to not use</font>

461
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,120
internal step right you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it</font>

462
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,970
outside source get to your spouse to do

463
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,160
it or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then if you can say</font>

464
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,170
yeah my wife<font color="#E5E5E5"> just called in and said</font>

465
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,850
that hey I needed to change my husband's

466
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:59,849
password because he's sick or something

467
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,620
and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do it like that's bad</font>

468
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">right they shouldn't be able to do that</font>

469
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:07,740
but there's risk doing the proof there's

470
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,510
there's real tangible actual risks and

471
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,740
doing this proof so I'm just trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

472
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,819
over-exuberance n xu<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 that you need to</font>

473
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,810
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that what you're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't</font>

474
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,579
going to get you in trouble<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

475
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:19,319
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you work in health care</font>

476
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,030
or something and you do this risk test

477
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,560
and you do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong not only</font>

478
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,240
could use someone get mad at you but

479
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,800
like someone might die right so don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

480
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,830
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> without really thinking about</font>

481
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,770
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> first but there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are some real</font>

482
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,060
benefits to doing this first it really

483
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,830
gets people's attention when you can say

484
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:37,440
hey I just got another bosses password

485
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,669
and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was really easy because you made</font>

486
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,240
a phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> call at a crying baby in the</font>

487
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,270
background

488
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,790
but it also gets by in right if people

489
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,470
say yes that risk is real I also know

490
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:49,470
it's real because you actually did it

491
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:51,360
and it makes security real and real cool

492
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,100
because like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> did you do that that</font>

493
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,050
curiosity gets people going and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

494
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,730
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dig into it with you and you say</font>

495
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,800
yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is what I</font>

496
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">did this is how we can fix it it's okay</font>

497
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:04,260
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that take to do and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

498
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:07,290
start that process once you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

499
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:10,290
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> the goal was you need to make</font>

500
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,540
this list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you got how you got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

501
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,690
and what went wrong so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you could</font>

502
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,730
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this last line here about</font>

503
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,770
identifying who is responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for what</font>

504
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:22,080
went wrong it's not about placing blame

505
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,520
on someone again we're not trying to

506
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,850
vilify somebody inside the organization

507
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,340
what you want to do is find out who can

508
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:32,428
manages that that component that would

509
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,709
have prevented this exploit and really

510
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:38,400
collaborate with them your team up with

511
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:40,260
them and say so we did this thing and if

512
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,809
we had this in place it would have

513
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,240
stopped it do you know why that's not a

514
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:46,950
place like it and they tell you most the

515
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,530
time they know that and they will say

516
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:53,790
yes I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> but and the reasons our</font>

517
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:55,740
budget time responsibility approval all

518
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,600
those sorts of things but if you can

519
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,900
demonstrate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is actually a risk</font>

520
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,699
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person says yes I know and I've</font>

521
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,230
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for so long can we</font>

522
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,030
please finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something about it</font>

523
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:09,120
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be the thing that gets you</font>

524
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:11,879
over the hump sometimes when you're

525
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,559
building up this once you've done this

526
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,750
proof then you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to define the</font>

527
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:18,840
remediation objectives what can you do

528
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:21,870
to repair that or prevent that in the

529
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,730
future and then this will allow you to

530
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,379
start making<font color="#E5E5E5"> a project something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

531
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,179
has a scope it has a timeline it has

532
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,179
resources assigned and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

533
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:32,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">process done you know I go to places</font>

534
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:33,900
that you can't just like have one guy

535
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,399
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go do something cuz he feels like</font>

536
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">it right you got to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through the chain</font>

537
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,929
and then at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it you have to</font>

538
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,210
test<font color="#E5E5E5"> it again you have to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

539
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:44,010
what you did remediated in fact did and

540
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,630
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like water going down the hill</font>

541
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,610
right you hit that thing that you

542
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,320
stopped it look for the way around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

543
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,090
and then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back again and you</font>

544
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,960
basically do this loop where you can

545
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:54,480
define what the good

546
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,180
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> proved that it's a risk exploited and</font>

547
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,670
and get the proof and then go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

548
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,410
and this will allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making</font>

549
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:04,860
those incremental changes without having

550
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:08,280
to I hate the phrase boil the ocean but

551
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:10,649
do it all at once right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

552
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,810
go through and make a master cyber

553
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:15,540
security plan of the organization that's

554
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:17,790
a three-year deployment people want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

555
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,560
see tangible and incremental changes and

556
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:23,730
that's that's largely what I'm talking

557
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,929
about here so before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go into the</font>

558
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:30,240
attacks list is anybody have any

559
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:32,220
questions on death you can feel free to

560
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:39,720
talk and ask me at any point<font color="#E5E5E5"> here yes</font>

561
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:42,450
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get c-level executives and</font>

562
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,760
management to buy into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well</font>

563
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,980
depending on your position in the

564
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,010
company they might be the direct person

565
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,810
that you go to with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that plan I'm if you</font>

566
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:54,900
take out to the component about proving

567
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:58,409
it I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the entire set in there</font>

568
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:02,280
is very palatable and most organizations

569
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:05,340
are ready to do the identify and protect

570
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,860
detects respond those kinds of tasks

571
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,939
companies are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to do we actually do</font>

572
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,040
those kinds of engagement of the

573
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,380
customers right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we have them calling</font>

574
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,810
us and scheduling workshops to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go on</font>

575
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,850
through that kind of discussion now we

576
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,919
don't as an organization go through and

577
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,120
do penetration testing so we don't go

578
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,010
through and say we're going to prove

579
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,239
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can hack our way in we bring in</font>

580
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:27,150
people like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come in and do</font>

581
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,800
that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we work with doing the</font>

582
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:31,590
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps which is the remediation</font>

583
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,540
tasks but when it comes to doing things

584
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,800
like the proving it you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

585
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,510
choose things that are not terribly

586
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">risky right I'm not saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

587
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,780
should go prove that you can hack your

588
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,600
sequel servers and steal all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data</font>

589
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">and put it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pastebin or something what</font>

590
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,100
I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> more is sometimes the</font>

591
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,350
process change like one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the examples</font>

592
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,760
that we had is there's a terribly easy

593
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,590
for somebody to just walk into our

594
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">office with a package go right past</font>

595
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:57,510
everybody and sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down at the HR lady's</font>

596
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,550
desk like why is that okay that is not

597
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:00,900
okay because once you get physical

598
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,370
access and machines like we all know

599
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,810
games over at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right so we</font>

600
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,909
need to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that's not okay</font>

601
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,470
and that's a cultural thing where we

602
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,360
need to involve the HR department

603
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,410
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's involves marketing where</font>

604
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,389
we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the message</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out to the</font>

605
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,820
organization about you know being

606
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:16,710
suspicious and being<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with saying</font>

607
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,510
hey what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are you doing here</font>

608
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't know who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are you're not the</font>

609
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:24,060
HR person you know and if they get that

610
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,650
suspicion of something wrong does do

611
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:28,379
members of the organization know what to

612
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:30,750
do who to go to what to ask and that

613
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,820
oftentimes is step one and once you

614
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,950
start that up you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing things</font>

615
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,149
like fishing campaigns against yourself

616
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,520
so that you get people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

617
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:40,620
questioning and being able and okay with

618
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,360
questioning so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many times that sack the</font>

619
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,370
organization is about security and their

620
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,780
first thought is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> these people are</font>

621
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:48,360
clicking on these emails like a bunch of

622
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,250
idiots yeah they're just clicking out

623
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,300
everything we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop it and every</font>

624
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,250
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> they click on something i'm going</font>

625
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,590
to write them up that's not that's not

626
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,120
going to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean if you're just</font>

627
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to tell me I'm a dummy every time</font>

628
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,090
I do something wrong I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not going</font>

629
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,510
to tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I do something wrong</font>

630
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:05,189
and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that when</font>

631
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:07,950
somebody finds something that's wrong it

632
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,930
says look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this flag right then you</font>

633
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,730
reward them for they become heroes and

634
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,440
then people<font color="#E5E5E5"> get interested in like how</font>

635
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">did you get that how did you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find that</font>

636
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,470
and it starts<font color="#CCCCCC"> building that awareness</font>

637
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,700
and that's more or less what we're

638
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:24,180
talking about here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is starting with</font>

639
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:25,980
those sorts of things any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

640
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:31,080
the second half here I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go over</font>

641
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:32,640
some some attacks that I think are the

642
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,580
first couple that we should worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

643
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,590
doing some mitigation against if you

644
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,659
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Praetorian they are a</font>

645
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:41,340
company that has a red team division

646
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,470
they do some penetration testing and

647
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:46,169
they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> white paper study that was</font>

648
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:48,750
released a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit ago where they had</font>

649
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:51,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">100 pen tests over the course of about a</font>

650
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:53,190
year and they were doing several

651
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,550
real-world exploits in their<font color="#E5E5E5"> tests and</font>

652
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:58,950
of course what they found is that the

653
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:00,930
majority of their exploits were all old

654
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,370
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were not based on zero-day attacks</font>

655
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,780
these were things that had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

656
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:06,209
for a very long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was</font>

657
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:09,300
basically a result of patches not being

658
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:12,810
done or misconfigurations but largely

659
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:14,980
and by far the attacks were based or

660
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:17,710
rooted in<font color="#CCCCCC"> credentials that</font>

661
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,790
so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start with credentials and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

662
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:22,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">were basically talking about passwords</font>

663
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:24,070
so on one slide to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all the</font>

664
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:26,410
password advice and kind of in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one place</font>

665
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:28,178
we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to use longer</font>

666
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:30,280
passwords for our end users for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

667
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:32,080
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> and on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> punctuation the spaces is ok</font>

668
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,750
it's alright to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and just type</font>

669
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,960
out a sentence the longer the password

670
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:39,520
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> better and when we start using</font>

671
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,809
longer passwords the biggest feedback

672
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,820
that we get for people as I don't want

673
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:45,850
to type that it's so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> to type all</font>

674
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the time as an organization who controls</font>

675
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,840
the access to systems in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

676
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,940
environment what we can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is</font>

677
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,470
give people single sign-on I mean we're

678
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,610
used to it inside of an enterprise and

679
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,169
now as we move to more web-based

680
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,178
services single sign-on it's kind of a

681
00:24:56,169 --> 00:25:00,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">big deal because we go to web pages have</font>

682
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:03,640
to type a password all the time well for

683
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:05,290
one if we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the machines that are</font>

684
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,140
joined to like after ad and we're out

685
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:10,299
using office 365 which is pretty pretty

686
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,500
common we can give single sign-on into

687
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:14,168
those systems so that the users don't

688
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to type their passwords as much but</font>

689
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:16,750
we're logging<font color="#E5E5E5"> into their machines they</font>

690
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,710
don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to take their password</font>

691
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,360
if they're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like lettuce</font>

692
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:21,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">kalou so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is hello allows you to</font>

693
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,570
basically use gestures pins and

694
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,220
biometrics to sign into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the machines</font>

695
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:27,340
these can just sit down and it unlocks

696
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,630
if you need to do things like generate

697
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,889
passwords i mean there's obviously

698
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,900
password generators machine-generated

699
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:34,000
passwords are far superior to anything

700
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,950
that us humans can do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use the</font>

701
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,960
English<font color="#CCCCCC"> language so we generate</font>

702
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:39,610
passwords based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> English and then</font>

703
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,230
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Robert reef go out there and</font>

704
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,428
they create<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithms to just crack our</font>

705
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,790
passwords based on what we're probably

708
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,059
much better shape still use something

709

long but just generate one in other

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">and use complex passwords without having</font>

then when that password is out there it

shows the username and password and if

there i'll tell you in more detail some

of the rationale behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font>

742
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:04,040
following through the the attack kill

chain when we're talking about

744
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:10,460
credentials most of the major milestones

745
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,900
in here are related to credentials so if

746
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,470
i can get a password i can get an

747
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:18,650
account<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can make my next move so</font>

748
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:22,910
protecting credentials is a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

anyone good oh you weren't enough so

753
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:41,540
weak passwords accounted for well over

half of the attacks that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Praetorian</font>

pretty weak come down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to things like I</font>

the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just pop a JavaScript and</font>

move on and simple guessing of passwords

781

this actually is taken out of a study

782
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:49,100
rapid7 did where they have a manual

guessing process when they first try to

organization not a specific account but

789
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,340
if I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get into an organization</font>

790
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,590
and I can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like slurping</font>

791
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,720
address list off linkedin i can start

00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,340
running against the owa logins and i'll

793
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,750
probably get in with something had

<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty-five percent of the time of the</font>

00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:17,929
that's a bad that's a bad number but to

797
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,760
make matters worse when those users

798
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,990
credentials are found there's a pretty

799
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">good chances you're going to find those</font>

users on their machines with a local

801

administrator account and local admins

802
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,640
are going to take you all the way to

803
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,990
your end goal about<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

804
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,010
of the time if they get those

805
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:37,040
credentials so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weak passwords</font>

806
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:39,110
represent a really big risk so ways that

807
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,639
we can remediate that again using a

808
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,889
password sentence just making the

809
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,840
password itself better prevent things

810
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,400
like cracking and reversing the

811
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,669
passwords it doesn't protect you from

812
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,800
things like leaks passwords but if you

813
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:54,290
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement a better password</font>

814
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,960
policy one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you can just make</font>

815
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:58,879
the ADA policy so that it has to be

816
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,200
longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then start doing things like</font>

817
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,680
to play hello so they can use those

818
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,170
longer passwords but if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

819
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">prevent the common and well-known</font>

you're using something like office 365

823

you can get Azure ad premium which comes

with a self-service<font color="#CCCCCC"> password portal it's</font>

825
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,600
not something to deploy it's just a web

say is this a well-known common

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than that it will</font>

authentication for administrative

834

00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,949
people to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it does make it</font>

849
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:07,230
harder<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get in right for remote access</font>

850
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,549
as well we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mfa's so if</font>

851
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:12,390
you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like remote desktop</font>

852
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:14,190
or VPN there are ways to use an NPS

853
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,500
integration so you can do radius

854
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,480
authentication and use as<font color="#E5E5E5"> rama paper off</font>

855
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,059
to that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can also use the app</font>

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,890
proxy for taking on<font color="#E5E5E5"> prem web services or</font>

front of that too second it's at name

860
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,820
resolution poisoning this one isn't

861
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:35,910
exactly talking to credentials directly

862
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:38,010
but its purpose<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically to trick</font>

863
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:39,570
the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows is accessing the</font>

864
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,860
network when you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

865
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,540
network the first thing it does the

866
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,590
talks with dhcp server and the dhcp

867
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,720
server says here's all your information

868
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:48,299
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get connected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we can use</font>

869
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,580
that that expectation as a

870
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:52,980
man-in-the-middle to have you connect to

871
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:54,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the attackers service and then we can</font>

872
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,750
start stealing credentials or have these

873
00:31:54,510 --> 00:32:02,580
hashes from those machines as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and</font>

874
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:04,980
when when that this happens then it

875
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,840
actually allows users to start accessing

876
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,160
other systems because we can start

877
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,629
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on those machines and basically</font>

878
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:13,110
start doing a lateral movement on that

879
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:15,419
box<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the intent behind this is often</font>

880
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:16,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use it as a jumping point right and</font>

881
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:18,299
when we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that machine that's not</font>

882
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:20,280
our end goal our<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get into</font>

883
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:22,679
something better but being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to trick</font>

884
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:25,830
the client machines allows us to do that

885
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:28,559
so to prevent that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit more</font>

886
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:30,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated than a changing process but</font>

887
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,520
we can do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so on our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

890
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:37,139
your clients on network should be

talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your domain controllers to</font>

get the answers for name resolution

893
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:42,540
instead of talking to the internet and

894
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:45,540
they probably have no good<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

895
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:48,120
doing file shares through your firewall

00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,860
so we can block that as well the link

out on the network to its peers and say

903
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,549
well the DNS server doesn't know the

904
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:07,120
answer do you and if I'm an attacker on

905
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:09,340
the same subnet say yeah totally

906

no there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer it's me right and</font>

907
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:14,050
then you get redirected to yourself so

908
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:17,679
and the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is true for the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">netbios name service if if ll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MNR fails</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">things from happening for the most part</font>

913
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:28,689
we can use group policies to enact this

netbios if you actually just do it on

915

00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:51,219
like baking a DHCP server I wouldn't

923
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:53,590
give this instruction across the DHCP

924
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,850
registration to say I asked me for<font color="#CCCCCC"> W pad</font>

925
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:57,699
then I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to challenge you for</font>

926
00:33:54,850 --> 00:34:01,059
kerberos authentication to get to the w

927
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:03,280
pad file and then get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hash right so</font>

928
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:04,899
we can use a group policy for that but

929
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,270
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also disable the service that</font>

930
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,168
actually does it so regardless of

931
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,300
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you're getting that</font>

932
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:13,418
instruction from dhcp we actually won't

933
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:15,760
won't listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that command one caveat</font>

934
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:17,350
though is stopping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> service also</font>

935
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,230
stops IP helpers so if you do any kind

936
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:21,879
of ipv6 tunneling in particular direct

937
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:23,830
axis I actually have a history with

938
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:25,810
direct access so this one stood out to

939
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:27,399
me if my clients are using direct access

940
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:30,340
disabling that service doesn't actually

<font color="#CCCCCC">too okay third attack when we talk about</font>

local administrators and pass the hash

945
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:44,320
the the big problem that the reason this

946
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a big problem is because many many</font>

947
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,679
times they see organizations that use

948
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,030
the same common password across<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

949
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,190
workstations and sometimes the same

950
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">password across the servers as well so</font>

951
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:55,450
if i can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto a workstation as a</font>

952
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:57,850
local administrator<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can dump the</font>

953
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:00,399
administrator named account and get that

954
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:02,710
hash and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can use that hash to</font>

955
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,770
connect to other systems in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

956
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:07,900
often use that to reverse it because the

957
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:10,540
passwords on there will probably set you

958
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,680
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or more and passwords</font>

959
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,110
that were six eight characters long

960
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,089
we're probably fine well now they're not

961
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:20,980
right if it's a character's it saw its

962
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:22,240
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so when when they put</font>

963
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,910
in their operating system deployment

964
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,129
process is everywhere and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that password</font>

965
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:30,609
is more powerful than the domain

966
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:32,830
administrators and another way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

967
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:34,480
happens is oftentimes a group policy if

968
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,950
you go back far enough in an

969
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,869
organization sometimes they<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have a</font>

970
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:40,089
group policy preference that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

971
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:42,520
sets that local password so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

972
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:44,859
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad because we can just slurp</font>

973
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,780
the group policy off the file share and

974
00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:48,819
use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell script to just</font>

975
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,470
reverse the password hash that's in the

976
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:53,800
group policy preference and have the

977
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:56,980
credential and then we can access any

978
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:59,530
machine in the environment so for

979
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:02,320
remediation of recommendations on this

980
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:03,520
look at the way that you're using or

981
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,250
assigning those local administrator

982
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,759
passwords if you want to remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

983
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:13,390
access you want to have those passwords

984
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,680
be different and we can go and deploy

985
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:17,560
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> lapse which is really</font>

986
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,149
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> policy extension you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

987
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,040
play that through ad and then the client

988
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,140
machine or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server for that matter</font>

989
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,759
we'll go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll its password on</font>

990
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,350
every group policy update and you can

991
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,450
configure how complex how long and how

992
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:31,690
frequent it should do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's a free</font>

00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:35,649
thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> technet gallery</font>

994
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:37,300
and download that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATA is a advanced</font>

995
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:39,490
threat analytics and it monitors

00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,410
activity in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Active Directory it works</font>

997
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,450
through this gateway in center process

00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:44,618
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're on the domain controllers or next</font>

999
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,390
to the domain controllers you have a

1000
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:48,040
server<font color="#CCCCCC"> that basically does network</font>

1001
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:50,109
packet captures on the domain

1002
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,540
controllers and then it will use that

1003
00:36:50,109 --> 00:36:54,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">information to do analysis on what's</font>

happening on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DC what kind of</font>

1005
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:58,450
authentication requests or any other

1006
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,890
traffic that's going to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC and it</font>

1007
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,779
can use that to detect things like pass

1008
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:03,310
a hash<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the ticket gold and take a</font>

1009
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:06,550
skeleton key all that kind of stuff and

1010
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:08,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">then if you if you want to read more</font>

lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in it that they</font>

1014
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:14,950
basically tell you how the whole thing

1015
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:18,520
works but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure you've seen past the</font>

1016
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:22,509
hash nemore and then the fourth attack

1017
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:24,700
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1018
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:27,130
basically passwords on disk this is

00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,480
passwords in memory<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you've you've</font>

1020
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:32,440
heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> me me cats before you've</font>

1021
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,060
probably heard about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in the domain</font>

1022
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,870
conventional just being stored in the

1023
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,400
plaintext this is

1024
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:39,279
them again a local administrator on that

1025
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,930
machine can just run<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tool and then</font>

1026
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,520
scrape that memory space and get the

1027
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:44,410
credential not only the hash with the

1028
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,910
actual plain tex credential so we don't

1029
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:51,460
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to crack it we just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to ask for</font>

1030
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:53,560
it nicely and then the bigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

1031
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:56,260
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is there's oftentimes no</font>

1032
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,520
prevention of using tools like that

1033
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,410
especially organizations that are a have

1034
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,520
local administrator they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

1035
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,810
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopping people from</font>

1036
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,890
doing stuff because you know people need

1037
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,630
to get their work done they need to

1038
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:07,900
install stuff so they let him go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font>

1039
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:11,830
and do this and you really can't stop

1040
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:14,800
this on windows 7<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 2012 r2 and older</font>

1041
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:17,140
because the mitigation techniques that

1042
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,940
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do for this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exists there are</font>

1043
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,500
patches that you can install<font color="#E5E5E5"> but to</font>

1044
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,540
enable them you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> flip a registry</font>

1045
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,490
key and the local administrator can flip

1046
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:27,250
a registry key you know so this goes

1047
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:29,229
under the system hive but a local admin

1048
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,240
can become system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say act never</font>

1049
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:34,570
mind about that and then that mitigation

1050
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,950
goes away so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a preventive</font>

1051
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:38,500
measure so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's a little harder to</font>

1052
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:41,080
get in and do this but it's not not

1053
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,750
foolproof if we look at Server 2016 in

1054
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,460
windows 10 credential guard and device

1055
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,080
guard take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the equation</font>

1056
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:50,770
where local administrators don't have

1057
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:53,170
that kind of access and there is

1058
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:55,330
actually a fifth attack but that fifth

1059
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:56,650
attack is in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Praetorian white paper</font>

1060
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,029
so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that out i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

1061
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,800
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their website and look at it</font>

1062
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,870
they're basically talking about network

1063
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,340
segmentation there and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

1064
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:05,589
segmentation where you go through and

1065
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,180
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know you have apples</font>

1066
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:11,290
and things to prevent access to

1067
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:12,879
protected areas of the network so<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1068
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:15,430
recaps you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of summarize what we</font>

1069
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,230
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start out in doing a</font>

1070
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,609
better job<font color="#E5E5E5"> improving securing the</font>

1071
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,470
organization you really have to document

1072
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:22,390
what it is you're concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1073
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:25,419
specifically who owns it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what you</font>

1074
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:27,160
what you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then</font>

1075
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,600
you know it's not necessarily something

1076
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,680
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go posting external I</font>

1077
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,380
like look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing to improve</font>

1078
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,529
security right use need to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1079
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:37,120
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about it internally with that</font>

1080
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:39,160
list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can start prioritizing what</font>

1081
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,140
you're going to do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it figuring out</font>

1082
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,819
you know what is the likelihood and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1083
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:46,000
impact of it and start with those first

1084
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,530
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know your passwords are</font>

1085
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,310
weak<font color="#E5E5E5"> and puny you want to make sure that</font>

1086
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,980
you

1087
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:52,840
start making a better password policy go

1088
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:55,930
through and improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that your</font>

1089
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,490
passwords are configured and the way

1090
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:59,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">that your users can manage it if you can</font>

1091
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:02,049
do self-service password reset and mfa

1092
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:04,480
you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> having longer password</font>

1093
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:06,010
policy requirements and then if the user

1094
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,270
happens to forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a call to</font>

1095
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,280
the help<font color="#CCCCCC"> desk right they can just take</font>

1096
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:11,650
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it themselves and in fact a</font>

1097
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,110
self-service password reset is actually

1098
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:15,640
a good security measure because if the

1099
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:17,140
way you reset passwords is by calling

1100
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,120
the helpdesk and talking to a human<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1101
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:21,069
mean they're going to prey on the

1102
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,330
niceties of that person<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say oh I you</font>

1103
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:24,070
know I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get this email</font>

1104
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:25,690
out and I'm about to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go up and present</font>

1105
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,510
they can't get into my machine you know

1106
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:30,550
if you can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that equation or that</font>

1107
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:33,250
out of the equation then you're going to

1108
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:34,780
be in much better shape and then again

1109
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:36,610
reusing passwords is a terrible idea

1110
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,800
password managers and generators you

1111
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:40,840
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> really look at and there's a lot</font>

1112
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,780
to go through when it comes to improving

1113
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:46,750
security so it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea to get help</font>

1114
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:48,610
both internally and externally that is

1115
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:51,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that that that we do at</font>
