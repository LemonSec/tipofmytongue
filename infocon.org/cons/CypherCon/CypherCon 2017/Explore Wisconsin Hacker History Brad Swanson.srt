going to come look at the events the

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,829
based out of Madison office here got

13
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:02,640
roughly 20 years in in digital security

14
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:05,760
most of it primarily is a good guy um

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,689
everybody had that youthful<font color="#E5E5E5"> indiscretion</font>

browsing through<font color="#CCCCCC"> fairlight doing crash</font>

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,400
stuff like that which because the phone

23
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,470
goes out to the first month led to a

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,520
recreational interested in the phone

25
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,770
systems um my favorite day is social

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,710
engineering love social engineering

27
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,590
straight I've got cars out of people

28
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,619
when I was you<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright goodnight cars</font>

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:56,939
and money various other things but I'd

30
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:58,530
rather live in my favor so anyways so me

31
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,439
a hacker conference was talking about

32
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,360
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got here how do we put home given</font>

33
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,008
this this happy group this community if

34
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,710
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will we can't have to look at what</font>

35
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:11,068
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a hacker and my favorite definition</font>

36
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,620
of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hatchery so it'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the spanking</font>

37
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:15,358
hackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus crackers and that I</font>

38
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,579
booked into a system<font color="#CCCCCC"> a subtractor at</font>

39
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:19,109
this time<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's bc i shoot lasers on</font>

40
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:22,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">the top but it's favorite show is on</font>

41
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:25,019
he's a hacker my favorite definition is

42
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,048
<font color="#E5E5E5">one by Peter Ludlow who is a a language</font>

43
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:30,120
philosopher and Peter said that a hacker

44
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:32,010
is someone who takes traditional

45
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,139
technologies and it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> us a month</font>

46
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,310
gives them a new purpose and so that's

47
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:39,959
kind of what we're going to talk about

48
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:41,249
today some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the technology and some of</font>

49
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,810
the people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done these things</font>

50
00:02:41,249 --> 00:02:50,310
I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start with technology it</font>

51
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,750
all starts kind of back 1868 we had a

52
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,090
gentleman in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Washington eight-year</font>

53
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">Schultz here and visit the first</font>

54
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,739
commercially viable typewriter right

55
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,959
Milan d and there were typewriters

56
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,389
before that but they they were

57
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,239
commercially viable people don't want to

58
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:09,719
use them or they were named be marketed

59
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,150
throwing a reason thanks for his

60
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:16,168
typewriter miss Markham people wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

61
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,209
people bought successful he also was the

62
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:22,109
individual that brought us the QWERTY

63
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:24,659
award the qwerty keyboard was designed

64
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:26,849
by me of you have used an old school

65
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:29,310
type writer has like mechanical arm

66
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:31,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">tried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go up and get it ribbon putting</font>

67
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,239
the characters on your paper what

68
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,939
happened is those arms would be close

69
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,340
together you start typing to arms and

70
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:41,939
local ones they bind up nice target on

71
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,459
my trapeze bitter<font color="#CCCCCC"> herb appear Kristen</font>

72
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:46,349
percenter that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a good way</font>

73
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do things hopefully ladies feasible</font>

74
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:50,310
but better so we don't have this issue

75
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:52,530
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came up with the qwerty</font>

76
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,120
keyboard layout and it's just stuff but

77
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,669
I worry about see binding anymore but

78
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:03,299
it's conveniently<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody's used to it</font>

79
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:05,819
we also had a lot of genetics work that

80
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:09,090
took place stay and Wisconsin initially

81
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:11,129
um in 1810 a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people think</font>

82
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,609
genetics is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new thing but in 1810</font>

83
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:15,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">the UW</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Byrnison created the very first</font>

84
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:19,240
genetics

85
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:21,910
in the US and initially referred to us

86
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,850
as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> department of experimental</font>

87
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:28,180
breeding and it is Delta Janice of camel

88
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:31,540
so you have the female cow and she's a

89
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:34,270
good milk producer have a male down he's

90
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,280
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> good genes what happens when we take</font>

91
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,490
these two<font color="#CCCCCC"> tousand with good traits and</font>

92
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,010
read them the<font color="#E5E5E5"> baby tell good traits and</font>

93
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,140
so they kind of looked into genetics as

94
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,390
far as milk production you know beef

95
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,580
production what makes a cow<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has</font>

96
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:51,909
more meat on its bones that a scrawny

97
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:55,780
cow and they they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

98
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:59,050
of a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of early research there are a</font>

99
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,700
lot of advancements of genetics and

100
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">Wisconsin over the course of the years</font>

101
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,830
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten us to where we are today</font>

102
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,260
that we have the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bio hacking village</font>

103
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> encourage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every stop by check it out</font>

104
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,760
talk to those folks that<font color="#CCCCCC"> say it's a</font>

105
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,130
great villains to see there is no

106
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,250
experimental breeding as neat biohacking

107
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:20,950
village so just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that up</font>

108
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:26,080
there up front<font color="#E5E5E5"> I stopped by a whole</font>

109
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:29,110
nervous<font color="#E5E5E5"> of birthday</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's ah so then</font>

110
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:34,419
moving on kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of technology wise radio</font>

111
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:38,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">early radio was a kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a big thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

112
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:44,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the UW I 1915 they had a radio station</font>

113
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:46,720
called 9xm and then accept what they did

114
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,520
is they talked to other universities and

115
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,920
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the quad state areas they could</font>

116
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,340
reach what their signal was all in Morse

117
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,620
code they would talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about weather</font>

118
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,989
forecasts what's the weather doing in

119
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,070
Iowa<font color="#CCCCCC"> Barney I was hoping we better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

120
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,910
ready because they're probably headed

121
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:06,640
this way they talked about sports<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wars</font>

122
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:12,910
you know what was the for the college

123
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:16,210
game in 1917 they take it one step

124
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:18,310
further so immersed go to school but not

125
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:21,340
many people know Morse code what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

126
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,710
could do regular audio will<font color="#E5E5E5"> do regular</font>

127
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,869
audio out over the

128
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was it was pretty cool stuff at the</font>

129
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,910
time they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people didn't like</font>

130
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,980
it there are few<font color="#CCCCCC"> people if you receive</font>

131
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,720
these transmissions of their home and

132
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,630
they thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stupidest thing</font>

133
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,730
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew who needs racial who wants to get</font>

134
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:41,969
these radio transmissions of audio in

135
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,890
their house playing music<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe when I</font>

136
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:47,400
can walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to my record player</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> motor</font>

137
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:49,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">brighter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um every time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i say off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

138
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:54,419
way everybody is to take a drink it's a

139
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:58,680
new kind of game and there you go so

140
00:06:54,420 --> 00:07:00,810
they would broadcast audio didn't really

141
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,290
catch on quick it took some time for

142
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:07,680
provokes is used to that it have three

143
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:12,450
US House Mafia act and apparently they

144
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:17,340
educate licensed by FCC a wonderful tax

145
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:19,560
gathering organization and then you give

146
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:26,099
them their official license to broadcast

147
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:28,710
in 1922 and done a cool thing about 9xm

148
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:31,830
as its toll in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> air today we don't</font>

149
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:36,960
know if it's whaa<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok mwha but it's the</font>

150
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:39,180
same broadcasting<font color="#E5E5E5"> license safe room what</font>

151
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,210
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> say people obviously because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

152
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:45,180
the same organization coyote<font color="#E5E5E5"> eww kind of</font>

153
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,280
pushed through that and it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

154
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,200
the oldest radio station at this point

155
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,119
in the entire United States which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

156
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:55,860
kind of cool love at a bragging rights

157
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:58,080
for Wisconsin<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so radio that's cool</font>

158
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,980
where do we go from radio looking to

159
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,200
pass for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit 1947 an individual</font>

160
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,960
need Jonathan Bardis who was from

161
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:11,219
Wisconsin and his partners at Bell Labs

162
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,440
mr. retain and mr. Shadley invested

163
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,780
transistor then come up with a working

164
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,969
transistor they take it to their boss

165
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,849
and say hey look what we made this and

166
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:22,830
kept it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and that was I in December</font>

167
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:26,610
23rd very Christmas right<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's a</font>

168
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:28,650
transistor this really paved the way for

169
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,600
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> modern day computer revolution</font>

170
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,728
transistors<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the start of everything</font>

171
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,650
it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to have telephones we don't</font>

172
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,990
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hold on a cart behind us because</font>

173
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:40,329
they're massive you know computers went

174
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,070
from a room to a Raspberry Pi that you

175
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:46,090
can hold in the palm of your hand you

176
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:49,390
transistors really kind of let us<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

177
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:52,000
off with that no idea Big name of John

178
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:54,310
bardy is the guy was super sport and

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,800
transistors were not his<font color="#E5E5E5"> first love was</font>

180
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:59,979
a project<font color="#CCCCCC"> he work done he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a bell but</font>

181
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,939
wasn't his kind of his thing his then

182
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:07,210
was magnetics and<font color="#E5E5E5"> superconductor he</font>

183
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:10,240
thought sure conductors were attached me

184
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,910
out it's on the 70s it were tons of

185
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,150
superconductors stuff that within two

186
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:18,730
MRIs and he won a Nobel Peace Prize not

187
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:22,240
only for the transistor he also went

188
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:24,370
Nobel Peace Prize for tomorrow so<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

189
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the only individual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from everyone to</font>

190
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,890
Nobel Peace Prizes of visits in some

191
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,380
Wisconsin super cool like that there was

192
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:34,390
drama Radha transistor so I mentioned

193
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he worked with a mr. McCain and mr.</font>

194
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:41,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">shively mr. Charlene would tell people</font>

195
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,320
yet I had been at the transistor whereas

196
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:47,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">pertaining bardeen would say hey this</font>

197
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,200
group we invented<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transistor sean's</font>

198
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:52,390
we got man Shockley said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like</font>

199
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:56,410
you guys anymore among printing you guys

200
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:58,750
on Facebook and actually when either one

201
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,100
bit more transistor technology and left

202
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,310
these guys out kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cut them off from</font>

203
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,170
the projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so kind of some early</font>

204
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,680
days eighteen forties travel for him

205
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:11,949
none so yeah john bardeen cool guy and

206
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,620
this transistor well so we have two

207
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:17,080
transistor that's a huge undertaking but

208
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,570
what good is a transistor unless we have

209
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:23,500
a way to really use that a lot they see

210
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:26,410
58 comes along and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jack st. Clair kill</font>

211
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,960
be so they lost miniaturize stuff let's

212
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,880
make stuff smaller to fit more n and

213
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,150
tweeting this the first integrated

214
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,890
circuit it was clucky there's a picture

215
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,620
of my slide if you guys can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that</font>

216
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:40,689
call it cut that's pudgy it was

217
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,010
basically a terms of silicon with a

218
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,380
couple of components

219
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:46,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">I stood by a gold wire and that's what</font>

220
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,910
what'd you do to Lydia you'll see the

221
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,550
picture if you'd be like that works but

222
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,130
it is it and it allowed texas

223
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:59,380
instruments<font color="#CCCCCC"> we work for the time to get</font>

224
00:10:54,130 --> 00:11:02,170
a patent for major I circuits<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jen was a</font>

225
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,700
Wisconsin I kind of took<font color="#E5E5E5"> the surround</font>

226
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,640
that when he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> bendin he was cutting</font>

227
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,460
plate<font color="#CCCCCC"> dallas but we think rotiform</font>

228
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,770
regardless and so this allowed us to

229
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of take these things the transistor</font>

230
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,699
and your integrated circuits and now

231
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,750
these computers again are coming down

232
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:21,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">there getting smaller</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and faster what a</font>

233
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,470
coincidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> this all have the rapper</font>

234
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:31,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ozma I'm not saying one way or the other</font>

235
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:35,260
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh well I'm doing this time here I</font>

236
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:38,110
am perfectly um so let's start what some

237
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:40,750
people will quit we have some actually

238
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:42,280
some some pretty pretty cool people some

239
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty interesting people two pretty</font>

240
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,939
famous people from Wisconsin and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

241
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,469
to us some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these people in their</font>

242
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,140
inventions but these are people we got

243
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talking about that are more focused</font>

244
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,980
on the other person<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you will the</font>

245
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,450
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> one larry'll and whoever's even</font>

246
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,150
familiar with<font color="#CCCCCC"> larry land whoever of his</font>

247
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:01,120
work anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so Larry land Weber</font>

248
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:03,010
was way ahead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and nineteen</font>

249
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">seventy seventy came up with an idea he</font>

250
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,840
was a research scientist he said quite

251
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,700
great if I could talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my fellow</font>

252
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,250
research scientists at these other

253
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,700
organizations without having to write a

254
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,080
letter stamp on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it put it in the mail so</font>

255
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,540
we develop that they've all three men

256
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,490
and it was for theoretical computer

257
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,219
scientist to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send this new</font>

258
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:27,310
thing called email or electronic mail

259
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,190
back and forth get like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred people</font>

260
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,900
on it and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> success he said</font>

261
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,120
wow this is great what if we can share

262
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:37,240
more information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just these pretty</font>

263
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,470
messages back and forth so in 79 he

264
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,080
takes it a step further reading visit

265
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,630
thing called CS 90 does the computer

266
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:46,180
science Network and it was the

267
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">university</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> government and industry</font>

268
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,849
research

269
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,080
groups for able to get on this network

270
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:54,700
and do things it was him a precursor<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

271
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,010
the National Science Foundation's

272
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:01,060
network they had over 100 80

273
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:03,880
participants on this by 1984 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

274
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,219
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1980s he also helped to develop the</font>

275
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:10,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">first gateways between the US and Europe</font>

276
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,710
Latin America Asia he said you win this

277
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:15,880
great technology lecture of the world

278
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:18,580
and then 8790 to me also worked on a

279
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,850
national science foundation / DARPA

280
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:24,640
joint venture on a debit testbed project

281
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,990
would you're going to allow gigabit

282
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,689
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> speed that doesn't sell as much</font>

283
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:31,030
to us now<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bomb we call she has to say</font>

284
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,760
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave that fibrin in my home and a</font>

285
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:36,970
stair two days later but in 87 Gabe it

286
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:40,300
was fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that was a big deal now</font>

287
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:42,970
with Larry one of the issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

288
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:46,240
we've seen our hackers are so finding it

289
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:48,760
finding and exporting holes from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

290
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,560
original CS net days so basically this
