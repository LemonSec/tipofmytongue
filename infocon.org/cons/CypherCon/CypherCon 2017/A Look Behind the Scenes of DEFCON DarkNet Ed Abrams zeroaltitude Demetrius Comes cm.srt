1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,019
ready I<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I'm command code</font>

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,219
see our altitude so how many in the

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,690
audience have actually been<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dark</font>

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:18,779
that before<font color="#E5E5E5"> DEFCON DEFCON end darknet</font>

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,060
both who's actually participated in dark

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,269
net before who's done more than one

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,729
contest before DEFCON 10 one challenge

8
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:31,288
that contest believe you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't count</font>

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:34,680
really that's it all right well then

10
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,930
you'll learn a lot about it this time so

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,809
pay attention during this presentation

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,050
especially the presentation itself there

13
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,190
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> two ciphers in the deck I'm</font>

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to stop here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and let everybody</font>

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,649
take a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this because if you</font>

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:53,010
actually want to do the ciphers you'll

17
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:54,750
need this also<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't hurt if people</font>

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:08,429
want to make an audio video recording

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:12,780
please definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel free all right</font>

20
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,880
there you so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to try to frame</font>

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,390
the discussion of the dark net this time

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,850
in a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a creative way I mean</font>

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask the question is the dark net itself</font>

24
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,798
a cipher and we'll use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that question as</font>

25
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,559
a motivation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> describing what the</font>

26
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,729
dark<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is and how it works and talk a</font>

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:37,200
little bit about<font color="#CCCCCC"> our history and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we</font>

28
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:39,658
run it a cipher in my you know in my

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking has a lot to do with the</font>

30
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:46,799
context right in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve a cipher</font>

31
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:49,530
you may need some particular context

32
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,659
some setting some historical background

33
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,229
some particular thing that you're

34
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,790
playing off of in your in your setting

35
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,490
in order to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's a fun</font>

36
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">cipher for people to solve or in the</font>

37
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,048
case of for example soft cipher you do

38
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,450
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> intend for people to solve something</font>

39
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,030
that will make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it distinct for your</font>

40
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,400
group of people that will distinguish it

41
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,050
from other groups groups of people so

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,780
that they cannot solve it

43
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,850
and the darknet share some similarities

44
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,360
with that the darkness is a contest<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

45
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:24,329
we run at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Def Con every year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,930
characterized by being set in a

47
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:30,690
particular fictional world the context

48
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,030
is that there's been a pair of books

49
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,480
written by Daniel Suarez the demon and

50
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,730
freedom in which he proposes an

51
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,549
interesting premise what the world might

52
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,670
look like a little bit further<font color="#E5E5E5"> on from</font>

53
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:47,370
now in a sort of dystopian future that

54
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,470
is characterized by artificial

55
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,480
intelligences<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a very minimalistic</font>

56
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,930
kind that actually have a lot of power

57
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,359
over our world so the kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cool part</font>

58
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,800
about this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know about eight</font>

59
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,490
or ten people<font color="#E5E5E5"> came together initially</font>

60
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,020
for sorry but eight or ten<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

61
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,600
initially came together and started to

62
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,910
form a set of challenges that we call

63
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,850
the dark net at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Def Con every year it's</font>

64
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,920
now grown to 35 40 different volunteers

65
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,350
last year we had thousands of signups

66
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,190
hundreds of players all during all

67
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:21,690
strictly at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Def Con ranging and it's</font>

68
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,480
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> an online game to teach you</font>

69
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,540
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> from soldering all the way to</font>

70
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:32,820
sign language<font color="#CCCCCC"> and about 20 different</font>

71
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:35,070
things in between the yeah exactly the

72
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,470
purpose<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we sort of started out with</font>

73
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:40,680
was the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of creating a fun event</font>

74
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,230
with complex challenges some of which

75
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">were ciphers themselves but the idea was</font>

76
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get people moving through all parts</font>

77
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,739
of Def Con so that they could be lightly

78
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,200
introduced to all the parts that they

79
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:56,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">might not normally be able to feel</font>

80
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,980
comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> with or accessible for them</font>

81
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:01,170
and be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start handling those</font>

82
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,179
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of challenges so you know if you</font>

83
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:07,708
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about this the way I think about</font>

84
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:10,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like August fourth 1936 is a</font>

85
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:13,650
context the context of the you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

86
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,589
initial kickoff of the most important

87
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:20,220
war of the last century<font color="#E5E5E5"> World War two we</font>

88
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:24,479
of course have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DEFCON darknet being</font>

89
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,970
a also context-based challenge in which

90
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,210
people participate too

91
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:33,480
publish these<font color="#CCCCCC"> Def Con related goals so</font>

92
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:35,820
another thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might focus on</font>

93
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,680
when thinking about ciphers is that

94
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:42,659
ciphers have a very rich history and

95
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that rich history informs how the cipher</font>

96
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,840
is developed I'm sorry how it is a

97
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:53,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">position for people to be able to solve</font>

98
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:56,549
and the kind of the history<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it can</font>

99
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,800
also be an interesting set of clues that

100
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,980
we send<font color="#CCCCCC"> people off on in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> order to be</font>

101
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,860
able to solve them so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like a cipher</font>

102
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:08,550
the darknet also has a complex history

103
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,320
in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization we started off a few</font>

104
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago with just a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

105
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">volunteers in a world that was very much</font>

106
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,740
based off of this fictional world from

107
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,570
the demon and freedom written by Daniel

108
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,720
Suarez but we've grown significantly

109
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:24,360
since then we have now over 20

110
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,960
volunteers we've produced an immense

111
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,930
amount of content we sold in aggregate

112
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,690
thousands of badges we've written a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

113
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,880
of code and we've done this all to

114
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,400
support<font color="#CCCCCC"> this event that actually</font>

115
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,200
attracts hundreds of people every year

116
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,789
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very excited</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

117
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,200
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of behind the scenes the</font>

118
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,660
interesting part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is that there</font>

119
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">are thousands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of hours of volunteer work</font>

120
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,970
that go into putting it on every year

121
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:55,260
and this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of historical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basis</font>

122
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:57,479
is definitely relevant to this

123
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,969
comparison of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> darknet as possibly</font>

124
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:03,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">cypher something that's interesting that</font>

125
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">people might not you know know is that</font>

126
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:08,039
these kinds of events that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we put on</font>

127
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,680
tend to cost a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of upfront money that</font>

128
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,020
we attempt to recoup recoup in the form

129
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,979
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> badge sales and it's a significant</font>

130
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:20,549
amount and the logistics the

133
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,340
volunteers that have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> other purpose</font>

134
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,710
for doing this other than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font>

135
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,690
extremely interested in producing these

136
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,120
educational challenges for people and

137
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,580
getting ciphers and other kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

138
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,360
technical learning in front of people is

139
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:42,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's kind of it's kind of cool</font>

140
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:45,020
now also like a cipher the<font color="#E5E5E5"> darknet</font>

141
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,090
depends on a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of mechanics</font>

142
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,490
there's in every cipher there's some

143
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:52,008
interesting mechanic that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

144
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,439
some operational features some

145
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:57,889
mathematical algorithm or some

146
00:06:54,439 --> 00:07:00,650
relationship to set of symbols<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

147
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:02,629
characterizes how the the cipher works

148
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,359
and similarly the darknet is like that

149
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:07,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a good example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that and the</font>

150
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:12,020
algorithmic world is of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

151
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:14,750
20 minimum 20 algorithm which is as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

152
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,659
all know an algorithm that takes the

153
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:20,300
permutations of a bunch of independent

154
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:25,188
<font color="#CCCCCC">variables through a set of complexity</font>

155
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:31,310
algorithms and arrives at a final answer

156
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:34,580
of course the darknet too has its own

157
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:37,969
mechanics and there's roughly four

158
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,919
different global pieces of the darknet

159
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:41,870
that we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about the</font>

160
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,580
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the story the second is the</font>

161
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,080
badge<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardware component and</font>

162
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:49,128
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the software and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

163
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:52,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">logistics</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of running the event the story</font>

164
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:55,789
itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned before is based</font>

165
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:58,310
off of the stories from Daniel Suarez<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

166
00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:00,440
highly recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take a look these</font>

167
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,250
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some really cool books about a very</font>

168
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,680
near future very realistic possibility

169
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:10,310
of how limited artificial intelligence

170
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,589
becomes involved in global politics and

171
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:15,319
global economics and then from<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

172
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:20,000
there's also the badge which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give</font>

173
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:23,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">it two teenagers so before i get into</font>

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,629
the badge there is last year we had 25

175
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:29,389
some odd volunteers and about four of

176
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:30,889
them wrote our story<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if anybody</font>

177
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:35,479
followed it on Def Con last year there

178
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:37,579
was this near psychotic level of

179
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,500
twittering between fake accounts and

180
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:42,140
people talking to one another and all

181
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,309
kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things it made for a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of fun</font>

182
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">but these are these are all volunteers</font>

183
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:49,910
that go off and do this like<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero said</font>

184
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,740
we have we literally had to break<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

185
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,540
team down<font color="#CCCCCC"> into separate work stream</font>

186
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,310
this year so that we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

187
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,779
organize it so there's like every other

188
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tuesday there's a meeting and this has</font>

189
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:00,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">been happening since Def Con of last</font>

190
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,500
year since august of last year every

191
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:05,089
every two weeks the team meets and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

192
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,200
workstream leaders meet and then each

193
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:08,750
work stream meets at some other

194
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,180
frequency to heat things up to date and

195
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:14,029
these work streams range from the quest

196
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:19,819
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> write every year to story the</font>

197
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:27,560
badge itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming out here logistics a</font>

198
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:30,680
hardware art hard wagga alright so the

199
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:35,329
badge this last year this year is still

200
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:36,500
in the works last year we had this or

201
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,570
salt we had to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the hardware</font>

202
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,750
figured out we got it we laid out the

203
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:45,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">board ourselves that at all manufactured</font>

204
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:50,420
wrote the firmware I wrote the firmware

205
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:53,990
and we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to source all the parts so I</font>

206
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:56,149
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go on vacation once a year want</font>

207
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:58,220
to buy the parts six weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> before we</font>

208
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:59,660
headed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Def Con and the place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

209
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">bought the parts form cancelled my order</font>

210
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:05,420
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was getting on the cruise boat so I</font>

211
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,459
panic leak all 0 and say hey can you

212
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,079
order these parts because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> cancelled</font>

213
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:11,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> order for some reason key please do</font>

214
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:13,790
it he orders them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get back to that</font>

215
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:16,010
date back a week later and he's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey</font>

216
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:19,520
by the way the parts got<font color="#CCCCCC"> cancelled again</font>

217
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:21,980
so now we're like t minus four weeks

218
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,079
before def con starts and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

219
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the MCS so the actual processors for the</font>

220
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,170
board all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other parts are ready to</font>

221
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,709
go just not the actual brains for the

222
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:32,360
whole thing that was fun some panic

223
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:35,329
calls to a couple of sourcing providers

224
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,860
and we finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> got it in that's kind of</font>

225
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:38,779
the evolution of the badge it's not the

226
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,089
entire evolutionary one badger for the

227
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:45,620
one on the right but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the far</font>

228
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:48,050
right was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Navy are based badge that</font>

229
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,630
basically just did I are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second one</font>

230
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:56,719
is that basically that same badge except

231
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:59,439
it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ir as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a i squared c 1</font>

232
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,520
inch display

233
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,790
and then last year that's in cortex m0

234
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,500
with a full t9 keyboard so the

235
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:12,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">old-school push it three times to get a</font>

236
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">C type thing and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't show you this</font>

237
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:18,520
year's but I guarantee you this year's

238
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:22,330
blows all three of those away it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

239
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,920
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming together nicely if you're</font>

240
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:26,200
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing how the badge code</font>

241
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">worked from last year there's the github</font>

242
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,000
for it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> put everything up every single</font>

243
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,589
year including the final<font color="#E5E5E5"> boss quest this</font>

244
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,680
past<font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually had a bought quest</font>

245
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:37,570
where the agents needed two agents<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

246
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,859
players of the game need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

247
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:45,190
answer quest fast enough before this

248
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:48,460
fictional character was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mad Hatter</font>

249
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:51,910
this year<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mad Hatter this year was</font>

250
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:54,070
attempting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to break into the dark net so</font>

251
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,510
they needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to finish enough quest to</font>

252
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,070
keep ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it and get his nice screen</font>

253
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,330
up where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was showing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the players</font>

254
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,310
are winning or if they were winning and

255
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,650
had to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and forth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all night and I</font>

256
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:05,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">think somebody finally won</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about 4am or</font>

257
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:08,920
something like that but the final boss

258
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,510
class which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was basically a simple</font>

259
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,219
telnet server you had to connect to and

260
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,450
send the right command to but of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

261
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,160
they got<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dione's denial of service</font>

262
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,530
attack they got it got all kind it was

263
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,120
it was a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun it also has the</font>

264
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,170
eagle board so file so if anybody wants

265
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,510
to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get their own boards made</font>

266
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:25,689
those work too and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> every year</font>

267
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:28,660
what did the badge have it on the last

268
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:30,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">year at I are pairing so every badge</font>

269
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,010
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> public/private key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pair you</font>

megahertz transceiver until you I are

272
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,670
paired with somebody that added it to

273
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,930
your messaging to your context then from

274
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">your contacts you can sit there and send</font>

John Conway's Game of Life it's a set of

00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,459
all the challenges

286
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,500
and then the game running engine which

287
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:20,260
evaluates the challenges for each player

288
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,750
and shows the user interface and handles

289
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,420
the website and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the other things the</font>

290
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,950
software is kind of cool actually I'd

291
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,420
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it at greater length</font>

292
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,430
of course we only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a limited amount</font>

293
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,370
of time tonight but it's based on a

294
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">reactive front-end that communicates via</font>

295
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,420
web socket so that we can broadcast

00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:39,579
messages in real time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> players as</font>

297
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,610
they're playing via push notifications

298
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,710
we have an API layer that's based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,510
latest and greatest serverless

302
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:54,099
for almost free we have an API layer

303
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,990
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> based in Python and connects to</font>

304
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,590
our databases through that and then we

305
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:01,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally have a go server engine that's</font>

306
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:03,700
running the basis of the game engine

307

that serves the<font color="#E5E5E5"> WebSockets that also</font>

308
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,260
handles all of the real time players not

309
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:14,020
really the right word<font color="#CCCCCC"> why did you slip</font>

310
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:17,890
absurd a server no absurd I'm the DBA

311
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:20,170
I'm absurd about oh yeah it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

312
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:23,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">a there's like there's literally</font>

313
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,990
billions literal literally billions of

314
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:29,800
sequel functions it's amazing it's a

315
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:31,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a cool system it allows actually</font>

316
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,280
the cool thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the sequel</font>

317
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:37,030
functions is that the Python<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">gopher uh backends barely have any logic</font>

319
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,870

320
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:44,140
sequel layer and so there's um there's

321
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,930
an incredible ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lodge</font>

322
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,280
across those layers by simply

323
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,439
abstracting those out in sequel

324
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:56,680
functions and and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome</font>

325
00:14:50,440 --> 00:15:02,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually well believe like this color</font>
