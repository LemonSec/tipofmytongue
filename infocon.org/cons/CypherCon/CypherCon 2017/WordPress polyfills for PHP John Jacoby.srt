work on WordPress whole time which is

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,100
pretty great took a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get there</font>

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,020
and as WordPress is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open source piece</font>

capabilities which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a big deal</font>

34
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:35,970
you care about access control to various

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:39,479
things on the web and again the

36

companies that pay me early hour campeon

they are all GPL license available for

free you can use them and not pay me a

matters or<font color="#E5E5E5"> why you should be happy that</font>

60
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:39,620
WordPress has them for the most part

68
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,470
interesting to think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress is a</font>

69
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:06,739
piece of software that's about 14 years

00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:19,669
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great but there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lots of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">infinite list that have lots of websites</font>

77
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:31,970
that are hosted using old versions of

78
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:34,400
PHP and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay any days I I'm</font>

79
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,829
really okay but I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> why that is the</font>

80
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">way that things work and so eventually</font>

81
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:45,229
what sometimes happens is a PHP gets

82
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:48,889
better but companies don't deploy new

83
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:51,650
versions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> PHP but they do deploy new</font>

84
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:53,900
versions of wordpress and wordpress will

85
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">auto update itself for Maya</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> releases</font>

86
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,549
which means we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can silently pre</font>

87
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:02,030
secretively improve the security of

88
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:03,949
things of every 12 or 24 hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

89
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:08,540
wordpress for us to do version of itself

90
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:12,169
and so Holly those help us do that the

91
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">first place if you cared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the code</font>

92
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:16,549
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to there will be code in</font>

93
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,310
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides that it won't be all that SME</font>

94
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:20,630
so don't be scared but the first place

95
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,450
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could look if you care to look</font>

96
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,850
is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress is includes folder</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

97
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:30,479
compact

98
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:34,500
that PHP that aisle is full of weird

99
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:38,130
little functions that are new to new

100
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:42,360
versions of PHP that we provide

101
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:47,610
basically 141 compatibility with some of

102
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:50,970
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are hashing functions salts keys</font>

103
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,670
weird things anyways the neat<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

104
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,220
about compatible<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah'd of the functions</font>

105
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,590
in it as well as the functions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

106
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,620
with pluggable that PHP which is like

107
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,719
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite file that most people</font>

108
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,260
that develop with<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress absolutely</font>

109
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,020
hate the thing with pluggable and

110
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:12,570
compact up eh p is all of the functions

111
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are in those two files can be</font>

112
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:18,630
overwritten if you have a better

113
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,609
solution for yourself or you run<font color="#CCCCCC"> a type</font>

114
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,070
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress installation that requires</font>

115
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,460
you to have different hashing functions

116
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:29,099
more encryptions weirder<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys longer</font>

117
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">salts whatever the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress</font>

118
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,020
wants to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> flexible and lots to let you</font>

119
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,700
manipulate those things or improve those

120
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,469
things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

121
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,830
the more common functions that are

122
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:43,290
overwritten or that<font color="#E5E5E5"> our that we include</font>

123
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:46,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are sort of polyfills implausible</font>

124
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,750
that if you run a wordpress installation

125
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,070
and you care about security and for some

126
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,840
reason you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like the default</font>

127
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,409
security that<font color="#CCCCCC"> wordpress comes bundled</font>

128
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,270
with you can take these functions write

129
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,190
your own version of them make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it better</font>

130
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">on your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own and honestly if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be</font>

really great<font color="#E5E5E5"> to submit a patch back into</font>

135

136
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:18,240
that does to keep the web secure if you

137
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,760
will is when you install<font color="#E5E5E5"> wordpress it</font>

all sorts of weird but the neat thing is

<font color="#E5E5E5">that these are unique</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:36,248
or you couldn't really insert them with

175
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:58,870
WP ran now random number generators are

176
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,240
not super great writing the world of

177

security runs a lot on random number

178

generators but if we rely on PHP es

179
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,789
would mean that<font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress would be</font>

WordPress juices of very specifically to

have its own random number generator to

as secure as we can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

195
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,140
that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are familiar with the code</font>

196
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,120
and what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

198
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,080
that WordPress has to do to be

199
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">compatible with versions of PHP that go</font>

200
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,330
back to five point two point three to be

201
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">cautious of people passing really long</font>

202
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,110
numbers that aren't actually integers as

203
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,760
integers and then try and rehash and

204
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,040
remap some of the three cast some of

205
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,689
those things there are all these weird

206
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,400
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> dashes of isms that over the</font>

course of<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress being a mature piece</font>

208
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:20,270
of software has had to solve that are

209
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:22,699
for the benefit of everyone that uses to

210
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:26,480
use WordPress is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there engine to power</font>

211
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:30,170
their website so some of these if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

212
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,170
keep looking if we go forward again we

213
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,599
have the EP hash which is really using

214
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,280
by default md5 which we all know<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

215
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,970
not super great when it comes to

216
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,800
creating hashes for things but the fact

217
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,600
that it's pluggable if you see function

218
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,099
exists WP hash if you have your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

219
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,170
function that comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> first before</font>

220
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,640
wordpress logo you can find your own WP

221
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,130
hash function you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use some other</font>

222
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,640
hashing algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress would yield</font>

223
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:57,920
to what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you defined so if your WP hash</font>

224
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,460
function return something other than any

225
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,439
time it will let you override that and

226
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,510
provide better security now the reason

227
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,120
we seek without d5 is because it's a

228
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:11,360
relatively Universal across many

229
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:15,020
platforms all over the place it provides

230
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,030
adequate enough security for your 8020

231
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,400
rule of people who really care versus

232
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:22,370
people to know and if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care</font>

233
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,680
we want for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to override</font>

234
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,950
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that is more secure</font>

235
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,689
for what your application designers and

236
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,220
so it's nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to have an own</font>

237
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,690
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this functionality</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made it's</font>

238
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,190
like maintenance burden and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

239
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:37,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">source people could see it whatever else</font>

240
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,470
closing pounds but it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to</font>

241
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">have this functionality and even cash</font>

242
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:45,140
hmm if you're familiar with how PHP

243
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:48,350
works I wasn't available<font color="#E5E5E5"> until recent</font>

244
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:51,530
versions of PHP and so WordPress comes

245
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:53,720
with its own version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hash HVAC as a</font>

246
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,829
polyfill to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you're using an</font>

247
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,680
old version PHP including like

248
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:00,600
or 15 year old version the PHP where

249
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,979
Chris will still work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it okay you</font>

250
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,480
might get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the occasional like debug</font>

251
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,060
notice there's some care law but if

252
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,610
you've got WT debug<font color="#CCCCCC"> turned on but what</font>

253
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,589
present won't stop working some pieces

254
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:14,370
will break but for the most part will

255
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:17,640
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and one that is used quite</font>

256
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:19,560
often is WP hash password again a

257
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,560
portable function you can define this

258
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,719
for yourself but actually asteroids for

259
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,290
users or password protected posts or

260
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,440
whatever else is really really important

261
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:33,209
and so it alternatively the wp hashed

262
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,120
password or in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to hashed</font>

263
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:38,010
password we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hash</font>

264
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">brown sort of validate have sweeping out</font>

265
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,870
the function to undo this hashing and

266
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:47,010
verify that what's behind it is correct

267
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:48,540
but we include a password hash library

268
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:52,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's actually written by the folks</font>

269
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:54,150
that make phpmailer it has another open

270
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,880
source GPL license piece of software

271
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were able to inherit inside of</font>

272
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,330
wordpress because it happens if it would

273
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,850
eat those and the license and they've

274
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:04,170
solved that problem for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright the</font>

275
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,180
only maintenance version process is

276
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:08,550
updating new versions of PHP mailer and

277
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">House pradesh the name of these new</font>

278
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,910
versions of their software then

279
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,800
ultimately we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can reviews new version</font>

280
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:17,010
their new packages of<font color="#E5E5E5"> wordpress with</font>

281
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,170
their version of password hash or page

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:21,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">80 mailers this doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen really as</font>

283
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,969
often as you might think uh and

<font color="#CCCCCC">WordPress is kind of interesting as a</font>

piece of software because it it uncle's

286
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:32,969

password know the thing I like about PHP

291
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,740
I feel like I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheating sometimes</font>

292
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,990
because it mostly live most of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

293
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,180
in PHP and I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty</font>

294
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,890
syntactically simple it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

295
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,599
basic like it kind of easy like you

296
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,780
married left the right top to bottom we

297
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,270
go like oh this this and that

298
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:02,180
writers makes most least most makes

299
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:06,680
reading mostly pretty much make some

300
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:09,829
sense but in addition to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> function</font>

301
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">being portable wordpress comes with a</font>

302
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:16,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty sophisticated actions and filters</font>

303
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">ap on until the very bottom of this</font>

304
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:21,800
function you'll see we do apply filters

305
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,450
and then we pass that straight through

306
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,420
level which means if you were an

307
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:29,750
enterprising<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug-in developer or PHP</font>

00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:36,230
generate password you could filter

310
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,260
random password with your own return

311
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,510
value and intercept that on purpose with

312
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,490
something else and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't get</font>

314
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to at least get behind to validate</font>

315
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,819
it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what the result is and</font>

316
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,020
then be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

317
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:56,300
value so in many ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress is sort</font>

318
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,610
of silently designed to be as flexible

319
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:02,359
from every direction as it possibly can

320
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:05,420
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so there are as you could imagine</font>

321
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:08,390
security implications are concerning

322
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,699
occasionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this but when security</font>

323
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:14,210
issues come up in WordPress is literally

00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">this filters and things at not usually</font>

325
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,660
the thing that happens it's usually

326
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,640
logic error it's usually developer who

327
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,350
with good intentions wrote some piece of

328
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,569
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ended up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be vulnerable</font>

329
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:28,640
sufferable to something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">activator everything that WordPress</font>

331
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,740
employees literally all over the place

332
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:35,870
except for when you're a logged out user

333
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,660
the second you are off if you are logged

334
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:41,330
in the WordPress uses what's called with

335
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,209
nuts it uses kind of a poor man's

336
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:46,070
version of an ounce<font color="#CCCCCC"> no manam stands for</font>

337
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:49,850
tradition too terrible acronym but

338
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:52,040
number only used once in<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress</font>

339
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,330
doesn't keep a table of numbers so it's

340
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,980
not like they're unique and only use

341
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,710
one's ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the history of WordPress</font>

342
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:00,380
and generally speaking announces are

343
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:02,390
usually good for 12 or 24 hours so they

344
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,150
might actually perpetuate through a user

345
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">session or so</font>

346
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:08,910
else but if you don't want them to stay

347
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,590
static with your login session you want

348
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:13,410
announcer to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fresher and every single</font>

349
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:15,480
page load its global function that you

350
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:18,209
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> override and I just happened we do</font>

351
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,890
that on wordpress.org to make sure that

352
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:22,740
everything that you're doing is invoked

353
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,720
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ultimate of possible intentions</font>

354
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,720
you can have and that's what nonsense

355
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,620
you a check for user retention they say

356
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:34,740
this link this URL on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web is unique</font>

357
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:36,570
for this user if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NOC doesn't match</font>

358
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,150
then you're not allowed to do those

359
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">things and the way that works it's an</font>

360
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,720
intention jacquard did you mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">logout yes or hell if you need to delete</font>

364
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:52,470
no they're not doesn't match or scale or

365
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,350
you had the browser open for longer than

366
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:57,060
an ounce would take to expire then word

367
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,460
prices are going to trust that request

368
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:02,069
and at Knoxville fail will not validate

369
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that request will now proceed and so</font>

370
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:05,850
it's a way for workers to protect your

371
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:10,410
content to your users in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your posts and</font>

372
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:12,960
everything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in the world of</font>

373
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:16,469
WordPress where there are 60,000 plugins

374
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:19,230
and about 5,000 active free themes and

375
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:22,470
the public repository even though we try

376
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:24,090
really hard to a code review and look at

377
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,670
what it was doing and releasing and

378
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:29,190
they'll announces are one of the things

have lots of functions to make it easy

385
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,680
but it's still easy to forget that you

386
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:47,760
have to evaluate what if the users are

387
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing and we use a WP not stick and then</font>

00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,330
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use any hash which are also both</font>

include

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress it so it's a bunch of</font>

400
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:23,159
weird random compatibility library that

401
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,049
PHP said that came with the generate

numbers and randomization of all sorts

403
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:29,400
of things PHP<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 comes with this by</font>

404
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:31,440
default we have lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of plug-in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">relying on PHP 7 related functions and</font>

407
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,210
so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that functionality</font>

410
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:46,320
you never<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and so what happens is if</font>

411
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:48,720
I write a<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug-in ever live at PHP 7</font>

that's running PHP by if WordPress

of that I developers we know we can

428
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:31,379
any and I figure this is somewhat

429
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:34,799
relevant for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience wordpress</font>

430
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,289
historically has only had an inbox<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:45,090
that security at wordpress.org you can

434
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,030
use it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will come to us we will</font>

436
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,149

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">really great that's worked really well</font>

438
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,860
for us for really<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time but the</font>

439
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:59,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with an email address like that</font>

440
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:01,830
or a inbox is that is very few eyes that

<font color="#E5E5E5">to them which is sort of problematic</font>

446
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:15,360
because the thing with security in

00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">general is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do want more eyes on the</font>

that it still runs wordpress wordpress

which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> incredible because it serves a</font>

569
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:39,160
good site amount of traffic when workers

570
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:42,070
update but they all share users tables

571
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,630
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user and user meta database</font>

572
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:45,370
tables are global and they have their

573
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:47,350
own database server clusters now

574
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:49,270
surgeons way that power all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> users</font>

575
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:52,000
table concessions for wordpress.org and

576
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:54,700
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a constant that you can</font>

577
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,190
define to not let<font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress update</font>

578
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,200
global tables ever which means a data

579
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,550
schema change we had a column we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have I</font>

580
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,990
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> column and make it a bigger</font>

581
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:04,990
advantage or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we</font>

582
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:07,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">choose to do don't update those tables</font>

583
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:11,620
so the interesting thing with that

584
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:13,659
setting is it only<font color="#E5E5E5"> has really checked on</font>

585
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:16,239
multi-site installations of<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress</font>

586
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,800
and we were pretty confident that that

587
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,350
was like all building across all of

588
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:23,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">WordPress adoring everywhere there was</font>

589
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:26,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">one site that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a single site</font>

590
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:30,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">installed WordPress that was using those</font>

591
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:34,720
users tables and so I on the sandbox

592
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:37,720
Jesus life data run it commits it deploy

593
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,790
it update ed presador which at that

594
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,850
point was a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> site title and</font>

595
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:46,870
hearing on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> sandbox to watch it go</font>

596
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:50,050
through the thing and instantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> na geo</font>

597
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:52,510
starts paying IRC crazy servers of the

598
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:55,570
whole like all of wordpress.org all

599
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:57,580
decides API everything white screen

600
00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:01,090
everybody's across the entire

601
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:03,220
I mean we have that constant set except

602
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:05,110
super deep then everybody sandboxes and

603
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,030
configs I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hadn't even thought</font>

604
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,949
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it probably five years that like</font>

605
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:12,370
that was a problem that I would ever

606
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:14,020
have in my life it was like a thing I'm

607
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,780
very did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look great user tables</font>

608
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,310
that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did but totally not a</font>

609
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,879
purpose can<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can watch it happen so</font>

610
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:26,260
clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did but oops and so its up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

611
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:28,840
minutes 48 million rows and probably 100

612
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:31,510
million user better roads like a new

613
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,970
scheme<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a mysql and chug through it</font>

614
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:35,890

616
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:40,450
thing and so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was my horror story of</font>

617
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,030
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> all for customer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with them</font>

618
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:49,900
