00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:38,460
rapid7 um I'm a manager on the

5
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:40,860
enterprise consulting group and I want

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to present to you on the upside down</font>

7
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,620
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> going from network security to</font>

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications security just to frame it</font>

9
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,718
up this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not more time testing I'm not</font>

10
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,860
going to teach you like how to hack or

11
00:00:51,719 --> 00:01:00,660
anything like that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more</font>

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:03,539
operational security stuff so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,039
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to be you know if</font>

14
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,600
you're really in tune with the

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,650
application world that some of this is

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,929
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be reviewed for you a lot of us</font>

17
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought it was it was new at some point</font>

18
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,340
so I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have an</font>

19
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,520
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know the</font>

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,470
application world<font color="#CCCCCC"> a1 schools because</font>

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,570
there and then how to be effective in

22
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:31,020
this new world w on ourselves in<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

23
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,029
far we look and this is all being done

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:39,990
stranger things so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't seen</font>

25
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:45,450
it then there's some spoilers so so deal

26
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:47,399
with it so who are we according to

27
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">linkedin where you know these very</font>

28
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,020
professional people we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we've got</font>

29
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,810
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> ease of experience we secure our</font>

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,298
networks all day long but really what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

31
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,670
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus in on is the vulnerability</font>

32
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,800
management lens so we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

33
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,710
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> at man</font>

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:07,550
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> SI VES patch tuesday is no problem</font>

35
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:11,209
for us our pest management program

36
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:15,290
actually works you know it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

37
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:17,090
tell me just will give you done so so

38
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,040
anyway we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well and then</font>

39
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody comes up to us and says all</font>

40
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,829
right well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about our web apps where</font>

41
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:30,049
we send with that suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't look</font>

42
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:31,790
so confident anymore and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when we</font>

43
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,530
start looking at web applications we're

44
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:37,579
no longer dealing with this this world

45
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:41,390
of cds reviewing a cwe so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a much</font>

46
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">more generic software issue so like more</font>

47
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:46,760
info<font color="#E5E5E5"> khaled ation or more session</font>

48
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:49,730
handling so more about how program is

49
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,730
developed less than you know this

50
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:56,000
specific version of java or<font color="#E5E5E5"> adobe has</font>

51
00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:01,399
this specific budget you know it's much

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,640
broader so if you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mitered</font>

53
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,950
website the latest version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this their</font>

54
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,450
reference material is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,500 pages and i</font>

55
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,899
can't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've read a</font>

56
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:14,299
1500 page piece of reference material

57
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,420
and tried to incorporate that into a

58
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:22,880
security office program of fairly

59
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:24,200
nebulous stuff so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know i think you</font>

60
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,850
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us don't necessarily know</font>

61
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,130
what to do initially with this so what

62
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:32,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">do we end up doing well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

63
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:34,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is a statistic out here diesel did</font>

64
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,230
a survey and they found that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

65
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,290
lot of people were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there and</font>

66
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:42,980
they were doing penetration testing yeah

67
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:45,560
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> common they were doing security</font>

68
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,019
code review nineteen percent the next

69
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,140
highest one on this list no formal

70
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,580
testing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the warm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

71
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,410
fuzzy from that if i work at that

72
00:03:52,580 --> 00:04:00,680
company so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's just like in</font>

73
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,180
stranger things you know they have this

74
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,220
big problem that they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal</font>

75
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,860
with and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not exactly sure how to</font>

76
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,440
you know tackle this thing so they just

77
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">start throwing stuff at it well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

78
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,650
before we you know can understand

79
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,300
the effectiveness of those things that

80
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">were trying to view maybe we should</font>

81
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">start trying to think about what we're</font>

82
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,770
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with an application in the first</font>

83
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,940
place so with an application a single

84
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,909
application we need to think about

85
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,910
coverage so all aspects of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

86
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:32,280
application if it's a web application as

87
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,040
opposed to like a phone application

88
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,599
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about all the links on all</font>

89
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,990
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different business logic workflows</font>

90
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,210
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often are we looking to test this</font>

91
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,910
how long does it take us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through</font>

92
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,940
those tests what framework is this built

93
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,710
on those are all important things to

94
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:54,719
think about in terms of a single

95
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:57,060
application we don't thinking about you

96
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,890
know scaling this out I've worked with a

97
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,200
variety of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different companies and some</font>

98
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:06,000
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one or two applications others</font>

99
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:08,760
have hundreds so you know how does how

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,380
are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to scale our solution for</font>

101
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:15,599
this once the development cycle culture

102
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,800
reporting structure responsibility those

103
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all things that we need to think</font>

104
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,410
about as we start building our security

105
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,669
program for vulnerability management so

106
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,870
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we kind of know that that</font>

107
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:27,330
frame of<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference of what we're going</font>

108
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,560
to do with these applications let's take

109
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,300
a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some of the tools / you're</font>

110
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,410
using so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at test I</font>

111
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,330
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I really need to</font>

112
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,190
describe the value of a pen test of the

113
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,719
skirt I feel like everyone would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

114
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:41,190
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good understanding of the value</font>

115
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,930
you get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the cons are is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

116
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,790
it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be costly especially if you</font>

117
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:48,120
continually test applications after

118
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:49,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">release release release it's time</font>

119
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,980
consuming it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> built into your</font>

120
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:55,680
processes at all there's potentially

121
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,900
narrow focus so you know depending on

122
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,120
the Confessor and you know the scope of

123
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,219
the engagement<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on you know we start</font>

124
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking about if somebody you know</font>

125
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,480
breaks into the front door and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then just</font>

126
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,070
starts wreaking havoc inside but they

127
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,960
never actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> went and tested the</font>

128
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:13,050
windows the other doors on the building

129
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,489
so you know are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really getting true</font>

130
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:19,650
coverage of everything for that

131
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:23,010
application um next let's think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

132
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,659
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an overview so good review is you</font>

133
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:30,200
know

134
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:32,750
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it's comprehensive but the</font>

135
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,610
cons are is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> impossible to scale and</font>

136
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:38,330
as soon as you know we start reaching

137
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:40,100
some competing priorities that's going

138
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fall to the wayside you know it's not</font>

139
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,000
repeatable maintainable process over

140
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,979
time it takes time to train people on

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,590
how to do it properly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we're</font>

142
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">not being affected okay well how do we</font>

143
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,460
be effective well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

144
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,920
even get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that question maybe we need</font>

145
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,080
to understand this new world what are

146
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:05,090
the laws of physics in the upside down

147
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:07,039
so need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand the software</font>

148
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,590
development lifecycle basically how do

149
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,390
we say code from<font color="#CCCCCC"> 90 in our head to an</font>

150
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:15,890
application in somebody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

151
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:18,830
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know on that computer you know I</font>

152
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:21,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us that have been you</font>

153
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,930
know insecurity or even studied for like

154
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,969
cissp or something like that thing they

155
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about different development methods</font>

156
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,440
and waterfalls something that we think

157
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,530
about a lot where you make this really

158
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,850
big product and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> ship it like I</font>

159
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,289
don't know video<font color="#E5E5E5"> games are a good</font>

160
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,510
example of that you're not going to just

161
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,240
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a small little you know guy</font>

162
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,770
and then a new town you're gonna you're

163
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,430
going to ship an entire game so you can

164
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:48,830
play the whole thing right well a lot of

165
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,210
companies are not doing this waterfall

166
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">method they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using something called</font>

167
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:56,120
agile development and that's more about

168
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,669
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> out Minimum Viable Product so if</font>

169
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,410
I you know build an app you're going to

170
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:03,590
see you know value out of that

171
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,930
application sooner rather than later get

172
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,030
in you know people using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and then</font>

173
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,970
once they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> using it then you can</font>

174
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,799
expand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and start building out more</font>

175
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,050
feature sets you need a smaller

176
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,300
development group for that a lot more

177
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:21,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost effective and it's all about this</font>

178
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,960
rapid release so many companies are

179
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:29,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing that type of development model</font>

180
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:32,150
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill chef bill chip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this</font>

181
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,409
is the general concept of em software

182
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,870
development how does this actually

183
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:40,569
translate into

184
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:43,060
the tools in the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this so we</font>

185
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:46,510
started you know encounter this terrible

186
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:49,540
pipeline pipeline is where is basically

187
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:54,189
the chain of processes procedures and

188
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:56,529
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that make this code turn into</font>

189
00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:00,760
something usable so in this example

190
00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:03,460
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got you know so many rice code</font>

191
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,260
they ship it off to get up they use some

192
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,260
sort of automation program I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

193
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,630
familiar with Jenkins of bamboo but

194
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:14,319
these automation programs will do like

195
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:16,450
unit tests if you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> some sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

196
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,860
security program you'd incorporate it

197
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,600
there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where your build</font>

198
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,870
happens and then once that happens then

199
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,360
you'll ship it off to talk from dr. then

200
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:29,290
you'll ship it out to AWS to have that

201
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,680
live application so a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic</font>

202
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:35,860
workflow this might be different her

203
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:40,989
company but the general idea is this

204
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:42,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so who are the people behind the</font>

205
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,700
scenes that are doing this who are

206
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,650
developing groups well our developers

207
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,860
are constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to you know</font>

208
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:55,029
implement new processes or a process<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

209
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:56,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">it will mess new pieces of code so</font>

210
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,970
they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know be effective</font>

211
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,580
they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be smart about it</font>

212
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:03,100
because we constantly have war we're

213
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,970
coming at them all the time so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

214
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,120
they're going to write though they're

215
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,950
going with the code once you know they

216
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,450
run their tests based on that feedback

217
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:13,510
they're going to you know make

218
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:17,230
modifications and reach it these people

219
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,850
have a background in application

220
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:23,140
building they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have a background</font>

221
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:25,390
in security some of them might but most

222
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,189
of them don't so if you go and show them

223
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,160
you have some traffic capture that you

224
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:33,430
have a web traffic that doesn't mean

225
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,719
much to them which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fair</font>

226
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,640
because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to build web</font>

227
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,690
applications but I know how to do

228
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">security stuff so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

229
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:46,089
form that partnership of them another

230
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,569
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we should think about is the</font>

231
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">product</font>

232
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> owners are the people that are going</font>

233
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,689
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the decisions on what the next</font>

234
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:56,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">build is going to look like what</font>

235
00:10:52,690 --> 00:11:01,480
priorities were going to have you know

236
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:02,800
for that next hill so I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know want to</font>

237
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,790
mention these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're</font>

238
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to start trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to form</font>

239
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:08,829
partnerships with these people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

240
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:10,390
know try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to form some sort of like ego</font>

241
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:13,120
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and be effect when working with</font>

242
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:15,160
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people because you're really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

243
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,910
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get anywhere so how do we how</font>

244
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,589
do we you know partner<font color="#E5E5E5"> with these people</font>

245
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,360
well when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start talking with them</font>

246
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,160
your language is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to be one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

247
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,970
one but you start those conversations

248
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,400
definitely don't throw things over the

249
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:34,060
fence of them because we're trying to

250
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,949
improve you know their processes their

251
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,920
procedures and the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> and our</font>

252
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,870
company in general so if we're doing

253
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can do that without you know</font>

254
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:46,360
creating red tape for them we want to

255
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:51,070
show interest in their world in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

256
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:55,510
processes and prevent you know slowing

257
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:59,050
down their development and we also want

258
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,790
to find partnerships so if we start

259
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,650
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do like security through</font>

260
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,829
authority I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people fail</font>

261
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,959
there because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

262
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,870
and they start fighting politics and

263
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:19,690
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really going to get you</font>

264
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:23,590
anywhere so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we understand this</font>

265
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:26,680
world a little bit better<font color="#E5E5E5"> now so what</font>

266
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:29,710
are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the these solutions of their</font>

267
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,089
answers that we can use well these

268
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,900
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> views with technology we'll</font>

269
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:37,570
talk about that a second you can you

270
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">know augment your staff by managed</font>

271
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,470
services so hiring out for this or you

272
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,090
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to hire somebody that does</font>

273
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,950
application security for your company

274
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,140
good luck<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that because an</font>

275
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,550
application security people are in high

276
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,310
demand right now and there's not a lot

277
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,400
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you keep doing pen tests we</font>

278
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:57,329
talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that already but we're well</font>

279
00:12:53,400 --> 00:13:01,050
point of ignoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue so in terms</font>

280
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:02,580
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology we've got a laundry list</font>

281
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,990
here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i made this plate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

282
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,910
worried so that way you could use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a reference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to breathe</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">through the entire thing but just hit</font>

00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:17,130
looking at static code so write code

287
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:20,250
scan the code it's looking prayers a

288
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:22,110
desk is looking for issues during

289
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">runtime so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're doing</font>

290
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,330
cross-site scripting test sequel

291
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:30,180
injection that sort of thing I am stools

292
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,800
are basically trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a mixture</font>

293
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:36,540
of the benefits of both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those and</font>

294
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:40,560
merge them together a raft is an agent

00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:43,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">based tool I think you've like a hitch</font>

296
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,439
tool so an agent that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for</font>

297
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,840
malicious web traffic and then we also

298
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,900
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our web which is our last line of</font>

299
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:55,680
defense they're not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best thing out</font>

300
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:58,230
there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know better than nothing I</font>

301
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,150
guess but those are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for</font>

302
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,710
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know cross-site scripting sequel</font>

303
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:08,910
injection you know that low hanging

304
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:10,920
fruit so now the real question is you

305
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,650
know like okay now I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

306
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,910
things wouldn't wait to do with this and

307
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:19,829
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where a lot of was kind</font>

308
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:23,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">of struggle okay you know this is where</font>

309
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:25,860
we can actually utilize our strengths of

310
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:28,410
security people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our background by</font>

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,930
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a defense in depth</font>

312
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:34,740
with this we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on our</font>

313
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:36,209
security being<font color="#E5E5E5"> built into the process we</font>

314
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,000
want to automate as much as we can

315
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,980
remove ourselves from as much as we can

316
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,250
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will become about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a night at</font>

317
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,770
some point you want multiple tools at

318
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:48,690
multiple layers and we want to start

319
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,579
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about security training and</font>

320
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:56,940
building a security culture within the

321
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:58,800
organization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were in so when we</font>

322
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,390
start looking at that pipeline we need

323
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,579
to start analyzing what we're doing so

324
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,750
what are we doing today what is your

325
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,150
company doing

326
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:09,300
they you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know doing agile development</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

327
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:11,100
you know just to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of it do they</font>

328
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,430
have any processes procedures that you

329
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:17,100
should know what tools are they using

330
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,930
that's really important<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's</font>

331
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,180
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of dictate what other</font>

332
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:25,290
tools you buy to help secure your stuff

333
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:26,550
are they using any reports what are they

334
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,560
doing with that are they taking any

335
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:32,400
actions on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Brittany's any</font>

336
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,739
policies I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people don't</font>

337
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:38,010
ever think about policies procedures in

338
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,930
their organization policies<font color="#E5E5E5"> help build</font>

339
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">that security culture so if they've</font>

340
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:44,579
written something you should probably

341
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:48,180
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that and then build into it</font>

342
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,440
oh if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scan for CW ease</font>

343
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,839
you should do it early in the build

344
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,060
process it's cheaper that way if you go

345
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,970
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> into production and start scanning a</font>

346
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,439
you might blow up<font color="#E5E5E5"> your web app which</font>

347
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:01,740
I've seen people drop their databases

348
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:06,660
from doing that on a production mode or

349
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:10,950
yeah and just expected to face that late

350
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:12,630
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the build process but anyway once</font>

351
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,370
we get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lake of docker area that's</font>

352
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,260
when we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start focusing in on</font>

353
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,500
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we already</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

354
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:22,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network scanning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cee scans policy</font>

355
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,060
if your incense or sub and then you know

356
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,130
once it's in production we can go back

357
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:31,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">to doing the pen test up as well you</font>

358
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:33,060
know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> have those incorporated in so</font>

359
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:35,220
multiple tool that multiple layers<font color="#E5E5E5"> SAS</font>

360
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,010
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that in early in the process</font>

361
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:41,070
along<font color="#E5E5E5"> with fast or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the high after you</font>

362
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:44,790
know there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of similar acronyms</font>

363
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:47,160
here but right when you're in that

364
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,829
automation program piece that's what a

365
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,719
lot of those tools should be run to give

366
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,610
you as much you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledged about</font>

367
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,560
the vulnerabilities your<font color="#CCCCCC"> company's</font>

368
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:59,490
created before they hit you know

369
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,829
production once you go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the doctor</font>

370
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,240
area continue doing what you're doing in

371
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:06,780
terms of network scanning but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a</font>

372
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,849
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forget about themes in</font>

373
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,619
early stages<font color="#E5E5E5"> before they go live when</font>

374
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:12,599
they do now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm scanning they only stand</font>

375
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,290
production you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know let's think about</font>

376
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,149
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this or</font>

377
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process and make sure that it's</font>

378
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:21,430
fixed early on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're never hitting</font>

379
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:23,110
this inter production mode just for the

380
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:28,780
network-based all the abilities on that

381
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:32,050
and then again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll do you hit</font>

382
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:33,700
production to your pen test set up your

383
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:40,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">bullet rules for your labs in your ass</font>

384
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:43,120
building that security culture I you may

385
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,030
not know how to train developers how to

386
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,300
write more secure code but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

387
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:51,460
the goal is right so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to partner</font>

388
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:54,550
with somebody in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> development group</font>

389
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,930
to find out what your company is or what

390
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,480
are they doing today maybe they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

391
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:01,870
it you don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I find that</font>

392
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,520
happens a lot people just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have zero clue</font>

393
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,429
what's happening in you know the

394
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,410
development in their own company so

395
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,840
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> again find those partnerships</font>

396
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:14,230
help build<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know security</font>

397
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:16,030
training program internally and then

398
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,670
once you get into some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tool sets</font>

399
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,050
try to reduce friction show a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

400
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,810
value because you're making their

401
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:25,000
software<font color="#CCCCCC"> cutter and you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not putting</font>

402
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:30,159
injecting a ton of extra effort and red

403
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,750
tape into that process and then my

404
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,090
please let's talk about policies and

405
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:38,050
procedures so early on when people are

406
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:41,649
coding what are their you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know security</font>

407
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:44,649
efforts under any requirements that we

408
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:49,300
need me before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we you know ship off to</font>

409
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:52,720
go once things are in that automation

410
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:56,020
piece if they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the ulnar abilities</font>

411
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,360
to find what is okay what is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

412
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,620
what the service level<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreement is on</font>

413
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,490
that work that's going to be

414
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:05,379
accomplished similarly if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do that</font>

415
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:07,690
once we hit the network layer as well

416
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:12,070
that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty easy because you</font>

417
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:14,260
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just you</font>

418
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:18,580
know transition that<font color="#CCCCCC"> edge of this and</font>

419
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:22,540
then lastly when we go to production

420
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,639
layer define what is a lousy hit that

421
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,790
layer and what

422
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:30,330
and if something in<font color="#CCCCCC"> sounds what's your</font>

423
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:32,220
what's your escalation process there are

424
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,050
you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever going to hit a point</font>

425
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,900
where you say I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take down my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

426
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:40,530
