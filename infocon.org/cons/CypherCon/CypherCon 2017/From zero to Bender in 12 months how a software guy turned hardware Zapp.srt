149
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,370
to get a couple of these whatever they

150

194
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:11,380
three you've got a prototype dinner at

<font color="#E5E5E5">my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> collect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rated itself you've got</font>

are gated really be on to make my own so

200
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:30,940
the thing is come up homes a great idea

201
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,920
let's create a design<font color="#CCCCCC"> nauseated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

202
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,170
vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> go make a whole bunch and then</font>

203
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,500
we'll prob it right how hard not that

204
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:42,339
that problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is everything I knew about</font>

205
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hardware on one's life series egg into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,120
plotter I didn't know one thing about

207
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:51,340
embedded microcontroller but the buggers

208
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:58,450
anything and that was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> deathmatch 23 so</font>

209
00:09:51,340 --> 00:10:00,880
I got there 994 says that one learns

210
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:04,810
basic so we get your def con went home

211
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,480
on an amazon amazon prime if the the

213
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,790
all the LEDs and everything like that

214
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,800
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon i would you going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

215
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,439
the different<font color="#E5E5E5"> project that 50 / 50 get</font>

216

217
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,570
temperature it was great how r did this

218
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,460
beat<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually migrated up to getting</font>

223
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,390
largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotter so if i was going to make</font>

224
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,410
a badge<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to do something else</font>

225
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:43,510
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the the pinnacle of</font>

226
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:46,569
Russia might get to actually soldered on

00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:48,670
one of our 48 pins he compete chips onto

a breakout board<font color="#CCCCCC"> within on a breadboard</font>

229

dropped it on the tab detergent gristle

230
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,180
and actually be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to code it this</font>

if you donated type of work original

<font color="#CCCCCC">garrett whites and lashes thing because</font>

235
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:12,969
there wasn't a crystal detail<font color="#E5E5E5"> break once</font>

236
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,310
I hang at that nailed down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

237
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,350
understood how to solder<font color="#E5E5E5"> I create a</font>

238
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:20,140
project for myself yet then there was

239
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:23,410
still too far to our way they<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't</font>

240
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:25,090
have accomplished yet so I decided while

241
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:28,390
I make a Christmas ornament for some

242
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:31,780
family ramps and quarters like you know

243
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:33,490
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a bell and had LEDs</font>

244
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,800
around the ring it played in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas</font>

245
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:39,100
music really simple that the design of

246
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:42,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the China waited for weeks hard to show</font>

247
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,740
up and it actually worked so friends

248
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,800
enjoyed it and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of a human</font>

249
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:50,830
well my<font color="#CCCCCC"> current design also up here i</font>

250
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:54,430
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 555 timer i took out the right</font>

my<font color="#E5E5E5"> clip rings are wrong sorry okay so</font>

253
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,560
step or brainstorm so this is where the

254
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:17,320
group it goes it will what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

255
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,750
do hackers like bling let's put a lot of

that's a week we put in there get some

276
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:09,500
kind of outlandish ideas we thought

FPGA knows what board was going on there

NM te begun so we got into those ideas

282
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,388
out we kind of went through<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:32,569
realistic or what the cost to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that step</font>

285
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">i would take those ideas and searching</font>

286
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:37,790
prototype them so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really just</font>

00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:43,579
we actually do this and you know this

all we do that one way I mean up

00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:21,709
our code this was about Christmas time

00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:25,370
last year we did this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and firstly fail</font>

305
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:27,949
so still not very good at hollering I'm

306
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,779
better now that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to put issues</font>

307
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:30,859
with the shorting on these radiance so

308
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:33,290
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like well they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to short</font>

309
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,329
while they're underneath the thought

312
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:43,339
that's how I fixed it when we did the

313
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,689
actual badges we didn't surface mount

314
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:46,689
them much near

315
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,649
so step<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 instead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the bottom this is</font>

316
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,990
going through all the prototyping and

creating for these resistors and there's

00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:07,449

resources imagination there's no I like

329
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:29,139
the magic project so apply it here so

330
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:31,120
once we kind of had our our bomb set up

331
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:34,839
and we knew what we wanted put all in

really excited about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one to any</font>

idea what I was doing but everything was

00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,579
in one spot I<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it and do a lot of</font>

coding it sleep in one dled animation

340
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:55,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">better this is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of proving that</font>

341
00:15:54,579 --> 00:16:00,579
yeah all these components<font color="#CCCCCC"> work together</font>

342
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:02,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the same time the next thing was ok</font>

343
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:05,620
take all that off the breadboard put

into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ppv we decided to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four layer</font>

345
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:10,600
because why not do core layer we're

346
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,880
doing some RF we have to display we have

347

<font color="#E5E5E5">our five buttons we got our eight leds</font>

348
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,470
almost everything is represented what we

349
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:22,089
wanted this is where we had in the nand

here the lot of fails here too so USB

was backward<font color="#E5E5E5"> the display we can mix them</font>

00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:43,779
was wrong or diet coke right or wrong

Diggle our facials terrible couldn't use

it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> becomes likely to use it the little</font>

black pieces actually came off just

rotating blades on purple the prototypes

363
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,380
so it looks really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at learning</font>

you'll see our github if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

actually spin that each of these

evenings this was our very first<font color="#E5E5E5"> call a</font>

tender one I would white and black just

00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:36,730
like the regular human<font color="#E5E5E5"> fingers word you</font>

also know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks very different than</font>

is<font color="#CCCCCC"> oversee really painful and it helps</font>

381
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,750
out a lot of ale so we realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

382
00:17:54,100 --> 00:18:00,639
there's an internal pull up on the reset

383
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:02,470
button and are the reset pin so when we

384
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,030
remove the external bullet that we had

385
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,100
on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were vaguely distorting at the</font>

386
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,840
ground so if you press the button it

387
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,820
short of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the badge and reset the patch</font>

388
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,510
problem was we couldn't get into the

389
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:15,790
emotion in them so that would an issue

390
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,770
USB<font color="#CCCCCC"> with also screwed up still we're</font>

391
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:20,500
missing some sort of resistor on there

392
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:22,450
why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you ever put the display</font>

393
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:26,200
covering<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the better I don't know</font>

394
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:30,220
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a tad addition it's like a</font>

395
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:35,770

396
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:37,900
so it's kind of figured out what we had

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> ender one except those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bike</font>

displays that came up really concerned

404
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:58,810
about those because they trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tend</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell those in four different variants</font>

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,429
I cared that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tan worker was a scene</font>

and they're all over the map with which

ago about 300 yards an epic on English

550

<font color="#CCCCCC">walked by groups of vendors and then</font>

556
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:21,200
just watch all the beds go into control

it wasn't will be in reasonable point so

00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,140
interesting following on the Internet

727
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,320
people ported it to HP calculators

00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:26,820
experience now yes I'm gonna say well so

731
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:30,570
that's all I'm allowed to reveal today

732
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:34,620
we have others that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly removing</font>

00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:37,080
the code afterwards if I have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> tiger</font>

00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:50,910
welcome to come down don't want the way

00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:56,460
of it what we could be more slide that

736
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:59,730
promise nuts get something I learned

737

00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:04,800
magical muttering also did seem really

739
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,300
hard visually nuts it just takes a

740
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,970
little bit of practice state of their

741
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,520
hand drivers are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not too hard either</font>

742
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:13,410
last year I didn't I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font>

743
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,420
anything my drivers I collided right one

744
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,370
at the end once I was kind of hopin to

745
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,890
myself I brought the flash driver this

746
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:22,560
year I've written all my drivers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

747
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:24,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's been upon expiry I'm really again</font>

748
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,100
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really proud of the display driver</font>

749
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,560
on the next year dash because it's worse

750
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:31,049
than all my time there's a put a handy

751
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">close-up on hecka do it kinda explains</font>

752
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:37,800
you know where they will optimize it

753
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:39,420
with DNA so that's been a lot of fun one

754
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,430
thing if your team up making a badge or

755
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:44,040
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> server project like this think about</font>

756
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:46,980

759
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,750

00:37:54,750 --> 00:38:00,030
the battery will still work<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some day</font>

763
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,000
so

764
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:04,920
you think of your end user one thing

765
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,270
that we worked at good last year but

766
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,480
we're working on this year migrant

767

<font color="#E5E5E5">that add flexibility to the design so</font>

772
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,410
intend that your unique change

00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,540

thing imply spare parts yes of you so in

777
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:40,170
ours the display is great gradual so we

778
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,660
have wheeled up if<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vera what's coming</font>

and we have an easy way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> replace last</font>

the you just yet understand where things

kind of trouble so design for production

810
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,460
so figure out how are you actually going
