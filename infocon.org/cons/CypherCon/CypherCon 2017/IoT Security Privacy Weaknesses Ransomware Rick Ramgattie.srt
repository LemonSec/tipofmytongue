00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,490
love all things application tyranny and

41
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,850
reverse engineering while doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> cts much</font>

42
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:03,298
they have time and no i really i really

43
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,130
enjoyed mucking around with things

44
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,770
learning how they were saying where

45
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,989
their secure housing insecure I work

security consulting firm out of northern

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,989
Baltimore and we perform security

51
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,480
assessments for our clients we primarily

52
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:27,560
focus on application security so web

53
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,840
mobile native applications and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that approach is white box where we know</font>

56
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,299
know next to nothing about the

57
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:40,130
application to assess and generally

58
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:43,070
everything in between class today again

59
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:45,140
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about IOT and how</font>

60
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:49,820
insecure it is so I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

61
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:52,760
about a little bit about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the this whole</font>

62
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,769
notion of what is IOT how it can be

63
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,590
dangerous never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at two</font>

64
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:00,110
specific devices we have pumpkin router

65
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,420
and you have motorola focus on camera

66
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,700
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show just how they're</font>

67
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,070
vulnerable and then afterwards are going

68
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,399
to discuss a little bit about what can

69
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:13,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">be done to mitigate this sort of random</font>

70
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">insecurities that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can manage so</font>

71
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,880
let's pick up there to set<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

72
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">back now so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is deanna here</font>

73
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,650
mentioned all the time but what is it

74
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:28,070
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best way that I can describe it</font>

75
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:31,610
is it's a notion that all these sorts of

76
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:33,650
devices whether they're no kitchen

77
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:37,310
appliances like refrigerators or

78
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:40,310
thermostats or<font color="#E5E5E5"> just anything really it's</font>

79
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,230
not you met<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything can and for some</font>

80
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,970
reason should be interconnected and be

81
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:48,859
willing to talk with each other right

82
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:54,590
that it's a good idea it's a good

83
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:56,720
concept it's very it's very know where

84
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,310
anything to try and implement this sort

85
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,440
of thing but there are a lot of dangers

86
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:05,300
to doing son if you all remember back in

87
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:08,540
October of last year 2016 done a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

88
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,070
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS provider it was it would match</font>

89
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,320
it the office attack a distributed

90
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:14,600
malice or stack and it took a lot of

91
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,529
websites down for the better part of the

92
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:21,529
day sugar so this beat off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tap is</font>

93
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:22,830
reformed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mariah and it was found out</font>

94
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:26,969
that this hot<font color="#E5E5E5"> net</font>

95
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:29,008
that was a collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of compromised IOT</font>

96
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,110
devices everything from IP cameras the

97
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:33,210
baby monitors<font color="#E5E5E5"> thermostats they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

98
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,990
sitting out on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet unsecured</font>

99
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">and somebody found them and they found</font>

100
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,310
them they were able to control them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

101
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:44,159
they were able to redirect a ton of

102
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:47,610
network traffic to die and effectively

103
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,280
deny them from serving DNS queries which

104
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:54,810
caused a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money to a lot of</font>

105
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:58,469
healthy that day but it's it's more than

106
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:02,039
just that's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> just one thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

107
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:05,190
seen this one danger but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it poses I OT</font>

108
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:08,878
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> insecurity and IOT poses quite a</font>

109
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:10,349
few dangers to use it as well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

110
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,419
going to be taking a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at specific</font>

111
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:14,099
points today as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said and first time</font>

112
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:17,789
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking about is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

113
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:20,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">Culkin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rounded</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a fit so this</font>

114
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:24,090
router is it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very small office home</font>

115
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:26,279
office router it's very simple has a web

116
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,080
interface which you use to control most

117
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:29,879
of its functionality it has two bells

118
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,919
and whistles like they can connect back

119
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:38,039
to Falcon but otherwise it's your

120
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:41,490
standard route it but this router belkin

121
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:43,289
can implemented authentication in the

122
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,259
wrong way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm not trying to con</font>

123
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:49,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">delfin recent example but they were</font>

124
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:53,339
using client I authentication and what

125
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,529
exactly got any minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> so normally when</font>

126
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:58,589
your authentication application you

127
00:05:55,529 --> 00:06:00,539
would want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send whatever password it</font>

128
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:03,750
is to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> account you're going to send</font>

129
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:05,639
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the network to the server and</font>

130
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">the service on hash it using some</font>

131
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,180
algorithm going to compare it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with what</font>

132
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,440
it has saved on the server and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it</font>

133
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,069
goes to match they're going to log you

134
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:18,300
in and the most part that's kind of what

135
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:22,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">Falcon does except for some reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

136
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:26,009
they only or they hash your password

137
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:29,190
before they send it and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

138
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:32,099
JavaScript they have the save admin

139
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:34,199
password hash so might be a bit hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

140
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:35,520
see up there but there's this variable

141
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,039
password

142
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,990
and it's cheap as yet and password hash

143
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:43,949
right there serve down the user image

144
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:49,440
obstinate so really quickly I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

145
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:58,139
demo this for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys and all right</font>

146
00:06:49,440 --> 00:07:01,349
maybe spoken<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's go to the</font>

147
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:05,849
admin interface of the belkin very

148
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:09,389
simple let me make that there you go so

149
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:11,370
let's try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> login I am set the</font>

150
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:14,340
password to<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I have no</font>

151
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,110
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it is so I'm not even going to</font>

152
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">try and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what it is but</font>

153
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:21,960
instead I don't need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what</font>

154
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,520
it is because I can just go into the

155
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,190
JavaScript i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use Firebug</font>

00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:38,190
little bit that's your delicate area

159
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:43,619
based right here in the past<font color="#CCCCCC"> or rather</font>

160
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:45,750
the password hash so copy that and make

161
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:54,360
sure that I'm intercepting your classes

162
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:56,550
this isn't purchasing for that then I

163
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the password is so I'm</font>

164
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,020
just going to enter in some junk down

165
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:05,520
but birch Street will have captured my

166
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:08,909
request right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to post to log</font>

167

in WFC here it has whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I assume</font>

168
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:13,979
a dummy pod not entirely sure or it has

169
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,380
some hash of whatever random string i

170
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:18,719
entered into it but I know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

171
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,240
work so instead i'm going to replace it

172
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:26,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the ash that was in the JavaScript</font>

173
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:30,449
forward that request along and I go back

174
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:33,449
I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> now logged in if admin on Crowder I</font>

176
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:40,050
redirect traffic i have full control of

177
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:41,689
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's bad enough but i also use</font>

on your network I can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

question may be secure so it's too big

181
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:56,270
problem right but the second device I

182
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,680
think it's a bit scarier the second

183

00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:23,240
can have a lot of common utilities it's

00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:26,450
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help us in our demo and it's</font>

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:31,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">this it's running to webster's rather</font>

194
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:33,320
turning the same web server on two

different ports one on standard port 80

196
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:40,100
no I'm scared HTTP but that's also

197
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:44,329
running that sing much<font color="#E5E5E5"> over over port</font>

198
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:47,210
8080 and this web server has a complete

00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:53,210
lack<font color="#E5E5E5"> of any notion of authentication</font>

211
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:27,740
the same core functionalities command

injection<font color="#E5E5E5"> red and remote file inclusion</font>

213
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:35,240
which work will lead to a compromise of

214
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:39,589
this IP camera so they both happen in

215
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,750
this process for the firmware upgrade so

216
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:43,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that you're supposed to</font>

217
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,400
interface with is in us through

<font color="#CCCCCC">Motorola's own mobile app and but it's</font>

219
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically just a common interface for</font>

220
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:53,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web application so you know you</font>

221
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:54,310
would tell it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> download chrome web</font>

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,490

224
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,980
your phone and then it would upload that

225
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,990
firmware to the camera directly from

226
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:08,650
your phone so but that's all just

227
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:11,170
happening over HTTP expanded request but

228
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:15,040
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access this firmware update</font>

229

page and within the firmware update

230
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,860
process the way which we gain command

231
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:23,860
injection is through the filing right so

232
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not doing any real check on the</font>

primer call you provided something and

234
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:30,730
you get a check to see whether the file

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:34,029
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a natural primer file or any sort of</font>

237
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:39,100
archive but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing any sorts of</font>

238
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:41,350
checks on that and nor is it checking

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:45,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bombing that you provided it's not</font>

240
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:56,410
doing any input validation so I'm just

241
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:59,890
going to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the demo so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

242
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:02,439
very easily it's a firmware update page

243
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:05,860
and here at the ground<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's ended</font>

244
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything it's not going to not going to</font>

245
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,810
check whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sent but instead of</font>

246
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,060
trying to manually browse through it we

247

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:22,689
what it's going to do I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

250
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:25,380
it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to send pointed at the end</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of my address</font>

252
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:35,310
and what it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do is it's going</font>

become an obsession if we go back and we

256
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:56,190
look at the file nurses that are since

257
00:12:47,460 --> 00:13:00,180
it was not okay so it's a bit hard to

258

see I apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that probably a be</font>

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,819
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for before looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this Hannah</font>

it's using that as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back door it's</font>

265
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:23,040
what it's doing is its injector it's

266
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,930
taking the file name that you gave it

267
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,050
its putting it directly into a shell

268
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,219
command so there we have command

substitution get<font color="#CCCCCC"> back kicks what will do</font>

271
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,089
is it will take whatever's in the

272
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,310
sidekicks and then run that command

273
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:41,640
replaces the output Batman can be

00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:46,199
anything and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is running as root so</font>

275
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:49,920
the script that I just sent it is it's

there's a box on the device see this

00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:14,910
right here and since it's running or

since web servers on his roots<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

authentication authorization we can

287
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> video all right so i go</font>

288
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:50,039
to whoops

289
00:14:32,819 --> 00:15:02,219
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do is go to web server why should</font>

290
00:14:50,039 --> 00:15:04,439
you WI and part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the trip along with</font>

291
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,319
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as in the video feed I can also</font>

292
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:09,209
control the pan tilt zoom features so

293
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:11,998
we've meant that is harder script it's

294
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:18,508
just moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> X quest so yeah I'd like to</font>

295
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:27,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">use the camera let's move it up to the</font>

296
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:34,799
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just randomly read spooky okay</font>

297
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:38,220
so I shown you guys that these two

298
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:40,589
devices up here at work really<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken</font>

299
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,169
right the manufacturers developers<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

300
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:46,259
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really take scared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Anand so i</font>

301
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:47,669
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken be very dangerous but there</font>

302
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:51,419
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few things that you guys can use</font>

303
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:53,699
and I'm companies in particular to

304
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:56,249
protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> themselves from this sort of</font>

305
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:59,579
rampant<font color="#E5E5E5"> in security makanda heads so</font>

306
00:15:56,249 --> 00:16:01,169
number one if you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using</font>

307
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:04,498
some of these devices in your network

308
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:06,720
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said right make sure that</font>

309
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:09,269
the report on their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own subnet they're</font>

310
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,829
separated from any other devices so if

311
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:14,100
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some reason they were to be</font>

312
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:16,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromised that they can't be used to</font>

313
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,720
then gain further address into your

314
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,279
system along with that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

315
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,909
want to perform network traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis</font>

316
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:25,889
right so figuring out exactly what sorts

317
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:29,009
of network traffic is normal inside your

318
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:30,720
network and then anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> which goes</font>

319
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:32,309
against that norm you'll notice

320
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:39,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">something's up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drivers utilizes</font>

321
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:42,389
also updating security policies so

322
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:46,079
mandating that these devices patch when

323
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:46,410
men if manufacturers<font color="#CCCCCC"> rollout security</font>

324
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,599
update

325
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:50,790
making shouldn't be flights these

326
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,420
devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually getting past those</font>

327
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,740
updates managing credentials you're

328
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,529
going to want to make sure that policy

329
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,990
policies are there for those and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

330
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:02,550
commissioning utilizes so making sure

331
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:06,089
the place<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't just added to your</font>

332
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:08,579
network without any sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font>

333
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:12,149
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure without anyone else knowing</font>

334
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:14,309
i guess i mentioned i give you six

335
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,870
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna want to start planning</font>

336
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:18,119
ahead for that is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

337
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:20,760
rolling<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and some of these devices</font>

338
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:25,319
that manage recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> pat abilities and</font>

339
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,789
finally this notion of<font color="#CCCCCC"> camp trust making</font>

340
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,129
sure that these devices that you get are

341
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:34,110
from reputable manufacturers ones which

342
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:35,850
have a good track record of not only

343
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,918
taking security in the mind of building

344
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:40,379
the devices but also issuing<font color="#E5E5E5"> tiny</font>

345
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">patches when they do find security</font>

346
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:47,789
communities so and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys would</font>

is that you cannot block the half

355
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:18,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">numbers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and hassle patrick has oh it's</font>

356
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:22,440
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way of forming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cgi scripts it's</font>

357
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:24,330
just it's different than PHP cover

358

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,189
them so the camera was using hazard<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>
