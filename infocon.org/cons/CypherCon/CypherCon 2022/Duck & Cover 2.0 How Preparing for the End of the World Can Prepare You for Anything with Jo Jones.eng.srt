[Music]

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,920
okay

4
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,839
oh

5
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,800
all right everyone thank you for coming

6
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,920
this is uh duck and cover 2.0

7
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
how preparing for the end of the world

8
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,760
can prepare you for anything

9
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,840
so i know a lot of you guys stop by my

10
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,600
booth

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,880
try to hold this we're going to see how

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,240
this works

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,200
so

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,159
my name is joe jones i am affiliated

15
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,960
with the cold war museum in waukesha and

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,600
i also have my own personal collection

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
of civilian civil defense artifacts

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,320
which are displayed on a table in 102c i

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,320
believe so if you haven't stopped by

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,759
please stop by

21
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,680
it's really really cool

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,759
and so what we're going to do today is

23
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,000
we're going to basically

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,159
go over how you can

25
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,479
apply what was learned in the cold war

26
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,079
through those civilian civil defense

27
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,200
pamphlets

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,720
to everyday things that you might

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,399
encounter and you're like wow that's

30
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,680
really a stretch

31
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,280
yeah it kind of is but you know you guys

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,399
will really enjoy it so um

33
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,719
when i was creating this presentation

34
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,079
two years ago i had decided to

35
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,759
not go over nuclear war you know if the

36
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,080
bombs were to fall because we were so

37
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,239
far away from that that i'm like you

38
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,760
know what yeah we really don't need to

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,599
cover this we can just go over the

40
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,560
pamphlets and then go right into the

41
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,239
meat of the presentation

42
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,959
so um anyways

43
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:21,920
so we're going to go over how to

44
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,800
describe how to survive a nuclear blast

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,360
um it's really relevant today

46
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,160
so

47
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,520
step one

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,239
don't be under the bomb

49
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,120
there we got it so but actually um

50
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,720
before we go over how to actually

51
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,800
survive a nuclear blast and this will

52
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,640
only be about 10 minutes

53
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,440
uh we're going to go over um

54
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,120
kind of the nuclear threat that's going

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
around today

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,000
so uh

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,599
in the past when i've done this it's

58
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,360
been really hard to find updated

59
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,640
graphics

60
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,400
uh going over stockpiles and going over

61
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,239
um what would actually happen in a

62
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,800
nuclear war and thankfully or off

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,680
thankfully i now have updated

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,159
graphs and charts so what you're looking

65
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,360
at right now is 2022

66
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,159
it is updated on nuclear weapons per

67
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,519
country

68
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,159
so just to go into a little bit of

69
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,480
background one or two hundred missiles

70
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,200
could pretty much destroy the world and

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
when i say destroy the world just plunge

72
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
us into cold darkness kick a bunch of

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,920
stuff up into the atmosphere just

74
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,640
generally make it miserable for people

75
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,519
and so now you're seeing that um

76
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,440
america has about fifty four hundred

77
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,840
russia has about fifty nine hundred

78
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
we're not exactly sure of the numbers

79
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,840
completely and we're not exactly sure

80
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,000
how many of them actually work

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
but um it's pretty safe to say if

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,959
everyone decided to shoot off everything

83
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,799
at the same time

84
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,080
um

85
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,439
yeah it's just not gonna be fun

86
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,439
so

87
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,599
getting a little bit more into the bombs

88
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,280
we'll go through some of the uh

89
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,200
bombs that were some of the most

90
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,519
devastating so this is a nice graph from

91
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,040
2017 the two really little dots you see

92
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,439
off to the right are

93
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,439
hiroshima and nagasaki

94
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,000
and this is the scale so you can see

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,880
that

96
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,519
the bombs get increasingly larger with

97
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,639
the u.s firing one off in 1954 called

98
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,240
b41

99
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,639
and that was the most powerful one done

100
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,320
by the us

101
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,639
and russia kind of trumped us a little

102
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,360
bit called the tsar bomba so has anyone

103
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,440
ever heard of the tsar bomba

104
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,360
oh that's a fun one so we're going to go

105
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,199
into a little bit about what the tsar

106
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,479
bomba actually did so

107
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,400
the flare was visible and that's the

108
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,680
nuclear flash that was visible for 620

109
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,560
miles and it was also observed in norway

110
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,720
greenland and alaska

111
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,520
the mushroom rose to a height of 42

112
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,400
miles and the hat

113
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,080
was

114
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,240
sorry the hat was 50 my uh the diameter

115
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,120
of the hat was 59 miles and it was 43

116
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,199
miles so it was two-tiered

117
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,160
that's a lot that's really really big

118
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,560
blast wave circled the globe three times

119
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,639
the sound wave their seismic wave

120
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,360
circled the globe three times glass

121
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,960
shattered at about 480 miles away

122
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,360
and the sound that was generated by it

123
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,600
reached so far

124
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,080
they couldn't even um imagine how far it

125
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,759
was going to go

126
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,759
so

127
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,280
the map there you guys see the little

128
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,120
red dot around here

129
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,199
that's where the bomb went off and so

130
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,600
they're seeing it in greenland and

131
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,080
they're hearing it all over the place

132
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,039
and the waves traveled for three times

133
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,600
around it was pretty pretty crazy

134
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,560
so

135
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,280
how many of you guys out there

136
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360
and men and women of course how many of

137
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,639
you guys how many of you guys deal with

138
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,199
having to go someplace for your job so

139
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,919
something goes crazy and you actually

140
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,919
have to go there and fix it probably a

141
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,199
lot of you

142
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,319
now what would you say if 50 of the time

143
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,759
you wouldn't come back from that and

144
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,759
they would never see you again you'd be

145
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,120
like well this kind of sucks right

146
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,600
so the crews of the two planes that flew

147
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,319
this our bomba one of the planes was the

148
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,240
one that actually carried it

149
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,639
and the other plane was there to observe

150
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,840
it they were given a 50 chance of

151
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,680
survival and they knew this going up and

152
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,400
they were given a 50 chance of survival

153
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,600
however

154
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,680
it was more like 20.

155
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,440
but they wanted to be nice and tell them

156
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,639
it was 50.

157
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,039
thankfully both crews survived but the

158
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,319
bomb was so large that this is between

159
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,039
26 and 40 miles away

160
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,360
the shock wave hit them i believe the

161
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,440
shockwave hit them at 36 miles and it

162
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,000
caused one of the planes to drop a mile

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,240
because of how intense it was they

164
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,919
literally had to put a parachute on the

165
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,319
bomb so they had a chance of escaping

166
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,280
its blast wave

167
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,840
now when i was searching for graphics on

168
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,160
this this one kept coming up and i just

169
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,880
had to include it so it shows different

170
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,840
bombs it shows b41 it shows the tsar

171
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,280
bomba and it also shows earth going here

172
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,800
hold my beer

173
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,400
and krakatoa being 200 megatons to tsar

174
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,479
bomba's 50. so

175
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,440
i thought that was pretty cool

176
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,400
the anatomy of a nuclear explosion so

177
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,240
the bomb has been dropped

178
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,319
so now we're going to quickly go over

179
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,479
what exactly happens in the first few

180
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,400
minutes seconds and minutes

181
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,240
of the bomb going off because this is

182
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,160
important to being prepared

183
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,759
so the first thing you'll end up seeing

184
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,120
is the flash

185
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,599
the flash is very intense in all of the

186
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,160
there we go okay just tell me what i

187
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,520
need to jiggle the cord that's what you

188
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,039
guys are all there for

189
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,479
so you're the ones who

190
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,759
yeah you're the ones who come down and

191
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,199
tell me to jiggle the cord and then

192
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,720
it'll start working so okay so the flash

193
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,199
anytime you see a nuclear bomb go off in

194
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,240
a movie you'll see that it's a flash

195
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,000
um and some of the larger bombs the

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,400
flash can last the flash can last up to

197
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
a minute but it's mostly intense in the

198
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,400
first few seconds

199
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,719
so in those first few seconds if you are

200
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,240
unfortunate enough to be looking

201
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,120
directly at it you are going to be blind

202
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,279
now if you are looking in the general

203
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,279
direction the blindness could be

204
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,560
permanent or temporary it really depends

205
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,800
so

206
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,800
the thing to do is

207
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,240
that's why one of the reasons why they

208
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,920
say go into the shelters because you

209
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,200
want to avoid the flesh

210
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,360
and the next thing that comes is the

211
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,120
radiation and the heat this is almost

212
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,959
concurrent with the flash so when the

213
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,519
bomb goes off if you've seen any of the

214
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,519
tests you'll see that there's a flash

215
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,279
and then everything starts to mushroom

216
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,800
out and raise

217
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,440
that is because of the

218
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,080
radiation and the heat

219
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,920
the radiation there are two waves of

220
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,360
radiation the initial and then fallout

221
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,519
so the initial radiation comes directly

222
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,360
from the bomb that is the material

223
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,880
that's exploding

224
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,000
the heat is the fire wave it's the

225
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,959
heat wave and this is what causes a lot

226
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,320
of the damage

227
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,959
so the heat wave within the first couple

228
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,279
of miles is completely destructive if

229
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,279
you are outside you are a smoking pile

230
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,080
of ash if you are in a building

231
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,560
you could possibly be a smoking pile of

232
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,720
ash it depends on how close you are to

233
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,480
the explosion

234
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,560
the farther away you get out the heat

235
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,040
could be as simple as it stops at your

236
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,320
clothing

237
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,080
so it really depends on how close you

238
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,600
are two to three

239
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,000
two to three miles you're pretty crispy

240
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,680
outside of that you have a chance of

241
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,680
surviving

242
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,399
so then the blast wave so how many of

243
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,920
you guys have seen this house get

244
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,040
exploded

245
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,480
everyone has seen this house get

246
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,920
exploded so what is hitting it is

247
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,200
first when you see the dust

248
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,040
that is the

249
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,000
that is the um initial explosion so that

250
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,640
is the radiation part that is the heat

251
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,480
what you're seeing right now this is the

252
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,240
blast wave so this is the last wave

253
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,560
hitting the house so if you remember it

254
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,959
goes over the house and then it draws it

255
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,560
back in

256
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,560
so

257
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,079
this is a pretty good example of where

258
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,000
you want to not be

259
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,640
in a nuclear explosion

260
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,200
it initially travels over 2000 miles per

261
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,519
hour it does decrease significantly the

262
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,279
further out it goes

263
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:51,810
um

264
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,360
[Music]

265
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,000
in a five kiloton explosion the blast

266
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
wave destroys buildings within two to

267
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,240
six miles i know i put two to five but

268
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,640
it's two to five two to six and there's

269
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,560
um

270
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,959
a better graph here that shows the

271
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,680
possible blast effects of a five

272
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,519
megaton blast

273
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,480
so if you see ground zero you're just an

274
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,760
afterthought

275
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,160
somebody way far away is thinking gosh i

276
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,440
hope they're okay but they're not

277
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,839
within two to three miles is total

278
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,040
destruction

279
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,279
severe damage comes between three and

280
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,920
five moderate damage is between five and

281
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,079
seven that's usually where you can be

282
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,399
outside and be okay

283
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,640
and then between seven and nine miles is

284
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
light damage and anything after ten is

285
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,600
fine

286
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,279
so you're like oh okay well that doesn't

287
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,800
sound too bad

288
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,880
that's a five megaton

289
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,320
so we're going to look at a 15 megaton

290
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,000
bomb that just happens to be centered

291
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,160
right where we are right now

292
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,320
so we will be that afterthought we will

293
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,720
be that oh i thought they were in

294
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,959
milwaukee i hope they're okay

295
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,480
um

296
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,320
so i know it's a very small graphic and

297
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,120
i apologize but right where we are is

298
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,440
complete destruction if you guys are

299
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
familiar with

300
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,279
the area

301
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,040
waukesha

302
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,440
you guys are going to be okay

303
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,959
possibly

304
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,440
it depends if you're outside or not but

305
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,440
you can see just the massive destruction

306
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,959
that takes place

307
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,760
so

308
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,639
we wouldn't even know what hit us

309
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,399
and then wakasha would see a bright

310
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,200
right flash

311
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,040
then there's one more round to

312
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,360
make it through and that's the radiation

313
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,519
so this is the fallout

314
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,880
so fallout happens when radioactive

315
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,480
particles dust that's been kicked up

316
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,839
into the air comes down

317
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,920
you need to be in your shelter i like to

318
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,600
tell everyone that you want to be in

319
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,480
your shelter within 15 to 20 minutes you

320
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,360
are not experts you have no idea

321
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
where the bomb is coming from so some

322
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,440
people are like oh if it's 20 miles away

323
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,000
you have to do this if it's a hundred

324
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,959
miles away you've got five to six hours

325
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,200
you're not going to want to take that

326
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
chance you

327
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,200
see a flash you give yourself

328
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,959
15 to 20 minutes to get to your shelter

329
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,760
so

330
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,040
how can you guys survive

331
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,000
so let me tell you ever since this game

332
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,839
came out it's been really really hard to

333
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,079
find graphics online dealing with

334
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,680
nuclear war and fallout so i feel like i

335
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,399
almost had to include it because it's

336
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,000
everybody loves it

337
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
so um

338
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,440
the way you survive is by being prepared

339
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
being alert today means being alive

340
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,800
tomorrow

341
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
so this is kind of where we get into the

342
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,279
meat of the presentation it's basically

343
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,290
how can you apply

344
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,959
[Music]

345
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,839
what you learn from cold war pamphlets

346
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,680
and being prepared to how you be

347
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,920
prepared in your company today and in

348
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,440
your future

349
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,680
so

350
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,440
step one

351
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,639
one of the things that was touted in the

352
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,480
cold war pamphlets and by the government

353
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,720
is getting to know your neighbors

354
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,040
so getting to know your neighbors we're

355
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,120
stronger in a group

356
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,199
and being stronger in a group means that

357
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,800
you're more likely to survive if you

358
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,279
have people you can lean on so i picked

359
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,959
a really if you guys are familiar with

360
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,600
this this is the twilight zone

361
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,680
and this is the fallout shelter so not

362
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,279
exactly the best

363
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,360
uh example of neighbors but i thought it

364
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,880
was a really cool deep cut to put in

365
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,279
there but all these neighbors knew each

366
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,959
other so

367
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,120
if something happens to a neighbor what

368
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,360
is your first thing your first thought

369
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,810
is how can i help them

370
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,160
[Music]

371
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,240
so

372
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,959
how does this relate to work well

373
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,240
why on earth would you want to get to

374
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,079
know your neighbors or in this case call

375
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,839
your co-workers

376
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,240
so how many of you are i t

377
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,000
cyber security

378
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,240
you know okay so that's a fair amount of

379
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,199
you

380
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,000
how many of you i t guys like working

381
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,720
with your co-workers who are not i.t

382
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,959
we've got one bravo

383
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,199
so

384
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,000
i was in it for a long time as well and

385
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,320
i i didn't necessarily like dealing with

386
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,360
the people who would call me every five

387
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,440
minutes to reset their password because

388
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,279
they forgot it again

389
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,279
i'm in tech support now that's all i get

390
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,639
called about

391
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,680
so

392
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,199
the reason why you want to get to know

393
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,920
your co-workers is betty from accounting

394
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,880
right

395
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,440
you go to the company party

396
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,199
you get to introduce yourself to betty

397
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,560
from accounting

398
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,800
she has three cats did you know that

399
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,759
mitzi flopsy and mobsy right and

400
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,040
flopsy's on medication and betty herself

401
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,880
loves to watch the bachelor on thursday

402
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,199
nights and she also likes to knit and

403
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,519
crochet would you like to see some of it

404
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,240
it seems pretty like ridiculous right i

405
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,839
mean some of the small talk that you

406
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,440
have to do in getting to know your

407
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,279
co-workers

408
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,399
but

409
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,199
if betty feels like she knows you when

410
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,839
betty clicks on that email

411
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,160
that she's not supposed to and opens

412
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,560
that file that she's not supposed to

413
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,199
if she has a rapport with you

414
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,680
she's more likely to tell you what she's

415
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,360
just done oh my gosh i think i've

416
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,120
accidentally done something that i'm not

417
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,399
supposed to

418
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,160
rather than

419
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,120
close the laptop and go to lunch

420
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,959
right

421
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,920
so i know it seems i know it's like it's

422
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,560
not it's definitely not in my nature to

423
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,040
go out and meet your co-workers become

424
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,360
friendly make it a point to do that but

425
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,120
it really could save you some trouble

426
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,800
down the road if they feel like they

427
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,120
know you they feel like they can come to

428
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,360
you

429
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,680
step two is to create a plan

430
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,160
how many guys have to contingency plans

431
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,480
for anything it doesn't matter

432
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,520
oh

433
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,199
that's not the same amount of hands that

434
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,480
just raised when i asked if you guys

435
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,199
worked in i.t

436
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,359
so

437
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,079
in the cold war creating a plan is what

438
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,480
helped keep you safe how many of you

439
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,120
think that

440
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,039
these pamphlets are going to save your

441
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,359
life

442
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,880
how many of you think that these

443
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,919
pamphlets will save your life

444
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,120
they could

445
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,960
they could

446
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,039
but what happens when you think you know

447
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,039
what you're doing you're less likely to

448
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,799
what

449
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,640
panic exactly

450
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,840
what happens when you panic

451
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,760
you drop the ball how many of you guys

452
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,480
have been in a really intense video game

453
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,400
really intense something to do with the

454
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,480
video game you completely forget what

455
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,720
you're doing and then you accidentally

456
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,240
shoot yourself rather than shooting the

457
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,160
person you're supposed to shoot

458
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,480
you button mash you're like oh my god oh

459
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,200
my god oh my god right

460
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,160
so

461
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,360
the whole thing about the cold war is

462
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,039
if you have a plan

463
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,679
you're less likely to panic

464
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,720
so this little graph right here

465
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,120
the way the cold war worked is the plan

466
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,960
started with the individual the

467
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,160
individual

468
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,360
learned everything he got the

469
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,200
information from the government the

470
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,440
individual learned everything he taught

471
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,520
it to his family then he had his

472
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,760
neighbors to rely on then the local

473
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,200
government then the state government

474
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,960
than the federal government

475
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,039
but what is the most important part of

476
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,760
that whole cycle

477
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,080
it's family and neighbors

478
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,840
how many of you guys remember katrina

479
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,840
what happened with the federal

480
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,440
government

481
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,960
it took them a very long time to

482
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,559
response

483
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,120
what happened to the state government

484
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,960
it took them slightly less longer to

485
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,039
respond

486
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,559
local government

487
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,039
holy crap we just got hit by a hurricane

488
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,280
we're going to do the best that we can

489
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,919
where did the help come from

490
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,039
to individuals and the neighbors

491
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,080
so

492
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,000
civil defense you had pamphlets these

493
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,679
pamphlets told you what to do you

494
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,679
memorize these pamphlets and you know

495
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,200
what to do any one of you could ask me

496
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,880
what are the steps to build a fallout

497
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,840
shelter what are the steps to stocking

498
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
your shelter what are the steps to

499
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,760
creating a plan i know because i read

500
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,679
everything on my table and that's only

501
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,200
like a tenth of my collection there's

502
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,559
way more at home that i just couldn't

503
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,600
bring

504
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,400
i feel prepared you could ask me in 2022

505
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,240
all the stuff from the 1950s and i can

506
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,080
tell you with certain confidence now

507
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,640
would it actually help me maybe

508
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
but at least i know what i'm doing and

509
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,919
if you know what you're doing you can

510
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,919
adapt

511
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,520
so does that mean that you have to make

512
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,440
pamphlets for your company

513
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,520
absolutely not no

514
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,600
no you don't have to do pamphlets

515
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,640
but it's not a bad idea to let them know

516
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,039
plans to let them know

517
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,440
your response plans now

518
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,960
we have to keep response plans

519
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,360
confidential in some cases but just

520
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,919
giving them a general overview step by

521
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,799
step if this happens we'll do this this

522
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,640
and we'll take care of it

523
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,960
if you have any questions contact this

524
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,360
person this person than this person

525
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,679
they know something's going on

526
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,159
anytime the network goes down i always

527
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,480
i'm like hey guys what's up

528
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,720
you know i want to know what's going on

529
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,960
so your co-workers are less likely to

530
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,400
freak out

531
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,480
if they know

532
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
that there's a plan in place

533
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,679
you guys

534
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,240
are less likely to freak out

535
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,000
if there's a plan in place even though

536
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,360
the plan

537
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,919
maybe covers half of what's going on you

538
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,080
still have a plan

539
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,159
and you're more likely to adapt

540
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,720
and adapt to the issue

541
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,280
and we've got to add step 2.5 in here

542
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,280
prepare for the worst

543
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,159
so

544
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,320
all of these pamphlets were written by

545
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,559
people who sat in a room and tried to

546
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,960
figure out what would happen

547
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,360
how many of you guys take time to

548
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,400
just figure out what would happen

549
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,679
so let me show you guys one of my

550
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,960
favorite pictures

551
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,280
server fire

552
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,799
that's no good

553
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,880
right that's scary

554
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,200
so how do you

555
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,039
prepare for the worst

556
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,360
my recommendation is

557
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,840
30 minutes a week literally put this

558
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,440
into your calendar 30 minutes a week

559
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
think of an issue

560
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,760
and think of how you would solve it so

561
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,360
it doesn't even have to be your issue it

562
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,880
could be oh

563
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,120
i read about this happening to a

564
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,400
different company

565
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,600
how would we solve it

566
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,159
just plan for the worst if you plan for

567
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,280
the worst you're prepared for anything

568
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,240
so

569
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,200
don't be afraid to just be like oh

570
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,320
okay so if we get a ransomware attack

571
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,559
how are we going to respond to this

572
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,080
or

573
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,039
if our servers become crispy

574
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,080
how are we going to respond to that

575
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,000
don't ever be afraid to just let your

576
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,520
mind go

577
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,760
and see because you never know how it's

578
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,200
going to benefit you

579
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,760
um i was reading i do a lot of

580
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,480
non-profit consulting

581
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,080
and so

582
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,720
this is when ransomware was brand new i

583
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,120
was consulting for that well it wasn't

584
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,520
it wasn't really well known

585
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
and i was consulting for a non-profit it

586
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,360
was a really small non-profit worth

587
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,400
maybe about like 100 000

588
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,360
and they got hit with ransomware

589
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,840
and so like i like oh you know actually

590
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,280
i think i kind of know how to handle

591
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,200
this so we got them in touch with some

592
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,960
people i think they just ended up paying

593
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,720
but they lost everything

594
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,880
what they lost wasn't

595
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,640
that important it was like a donor

596
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,559
database so it was nothing like earth

597
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,159
shattering it didn't stop them from

598
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,280
functioning

599
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,120
but like i was like oh you know i was

600
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,640
just thinking about this ransomware i

601
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
read about it on the news and then all

602
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,320
of a sudden like two weeks later it hits

603
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,559
this little uh little non-profit in iowa

604
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,520
okay

605
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,540
so um

606
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,919
[Music]

607
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,360
definitely

608
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,280
think about issues how would you solve

609
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,640
them it doesn't even need to be your

610
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,159
game plan but at least you have

611
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,200
interaction with it

612
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,520
have dedicated channels

613
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,240
so during the cold war do any of you

614
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,280
remember 6 40 and 12 40

615
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,799
radio stations

616
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,799
if you know old radios you'll see those

617
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,039
marked in red on the am

618
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,000
so

619
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
what the cold war had is the

620
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,080
civil defense had the connell rad

621
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,360
stations

622
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,480
and so those stations were how you would

623
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,720
convey information how the government

624
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,760
both local state and national would

625
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,840
convey information

626
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,919
you can even get the reception in your

627
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,520
shelters you would tune to these

628
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,000
channels and once everything died down a

629
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,799
bit

630
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,559
they would begin broadcasting then we

631
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,799
begin broadcasting um

632
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,480
instructions

633
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,919
so how can you do this

634
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,840
make sure that you have dedicated

635
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,279
channels in your organization so this

636
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,000
would work two ways

637
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,720
ways that people can contact you

638
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,440
ways that you can contact other people

639
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,559
so if something happens you want to push

640
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,480
that information out

641
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,720
you don't want to be where okay well the

642
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
server's down

643
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,320
we don't know how long it's going to be

644
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,240
down for but we're not going to tell

645
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,160
them anything

646
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,640
[Music]

647
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,440
so

648
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,120
you know even the littlest bit of

649
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,400
information

650
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,799
yeah so we're working on it

651
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,279
okay can i go get lunch

652
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,480
well you definitely can get lunch

653
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,799
so we'll probably be back up by the time

654
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,720
you get lunch

655
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,679
but

656
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,240
don't be afraid to convey information

657
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,080
and have those channels those channels

658
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,159
are important people are going to find

659
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,720
their favorite channel to contact you

660
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,480
that's how they're going to contact you

661
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,240
i have this really annoying habit we

662
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,960
have a ticketing system but i'll team my

663
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,679
team's my it guy and be like

664
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,840
you know does this really

665
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,000
need a ticket or can i just tell you

666
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,360
this like that's my own little thing

667
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,960
that's my own little hang up

668
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,440
but um they'll answer me they'll be like

669
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,880
yeah you should probably put a ticket in

670
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,000
for that or

671
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,919
oh it's broken try it again i don't

672
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,720
think it's broken and magically it works

673
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,880
so you want to have those channels and

674
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,559
again that goes back to knowing your

675
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,880
neighbor knowing your co-worker because

676
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,960
they'll be able to contact you with the

677
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,360
information that you push out and it can

678
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,159
be

679
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,360
as detailed or as vague as you want it

680
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,000
to be but throw them a bone

681
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,679
because that'll calm everyone

682
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,880
now you're gonna be like i don't

683
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,559
understand how you're gonna get this one

684
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,760
to fit

685
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,320
so create a shelter

686
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,120
the best way to survive a nuclear

687
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,520
blast that didn't directly

688
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,120
blast over you

689
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,520
is to be in a shelter

690
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,200
there were lots of different shelters

691
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,919
that you could make

692
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,039
for any type of household

693
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,640
so you had shelters that were

694
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,159
underground you have shelters that were

695
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,520
in your basement you had shelters that

696
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,880
you built in your basement you had

697
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,120
shelters that you built from out of your

698
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,240
basement

699
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,720
and you even had municipal

700
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,559
let's go in the right direction you even

701
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,720
have municipal shelters that could

702
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,760
shelter

703
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,039
between 200 and a thousand people

704
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,960
having a shelter was the most important

705
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,279
thing how many of you guys go camping

706
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,080
and you're like yeah no tent

707
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,240
now you need shelter so that's the most

708
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,919
important thing especially during a

709
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,039
nuclear event it provides safety

710
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,760
so having a shelter means that you are

711
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,520
safe you are sound you can zen you can

712
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,520
wait you can wait everything out that

713
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,918
you need to

714
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,480
you guys and not just the it people

715
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,960
everybody needs to create their own

716
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,440
shelter and by shelter i mean this is a

717
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,279
place that you can work

718
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,159
this is a place that you can come to

719
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,240
that you can get things done that you

720
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,760
can think

721
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,159
so my shelter is my basement but it

722
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,760
that's just because it's a nice quiet

723
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,200
place in the house it's not because it's

724
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,520
a fallout shelter i do have one but um

725
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,919
well you can't be into what i meant to

726
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,159
and not build one in your basement

727
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,760
because it's fun

728
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,279
um

729
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,720
but you want to go to that place you

730
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,039
want to have that place where everything

731
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,840
could be chaotic around you

732
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,640
but you can focus i have my little zen

733
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,520
happy place because when everything is

734
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,440
going a little crazy

735
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,679
you guys are going to want that one spot

736
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,640
that you can go to even if it's for like

737
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,240
five minutes

738
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,720
just to center yourself

739
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,880
to think about what's going on to think

740
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,039
about your very next step

741
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,760
and then to progress

742
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,360
so that is one of the most important

743
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,880
things just like having a physical

744
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,559
shelter is important

745
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,399
it is really really important to have

746
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,640
that place where you can go even if it's

747
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,310
to give yourself a short amount of time

748
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,429
[Music]

749
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,279
and step five is to stock up

750
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,760
so stocking your fallout shelter is

751
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,200
really really important so fallout

752
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,120
shelters

753
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,440
the rule of thumb was after the bombs

754
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,200
fell you wanted to stay in your fallout

755
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,279
shelter for two weeks without having to

756
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,360
come out at all

757
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,080
and so by staying in that shelter you

758
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,919
are able to live eat exist

759
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,360
comfortably

760
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,279
for at least two weeks

761
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,520
after the two-week mark the radiation

762
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
would have decreased enough that you

763
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,480
would be able to go out for short spurts

764
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
so you would be able to go out and get

765
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,960
more food or you would be able to go out

766
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,279
and get more supplies you would come

767
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,760
back get decontaminated

768
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,200
and you would mainly live in your

769
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,440
shelter for up to three or four months

770
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,480
depending on how bad it was

771
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,320
but the rule of thumb was you wanted to

772
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,799
do two

773
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,919
weeks so seriously stock up us on as

774
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,679
much as you can

775
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,679
how many of you guys were fully remote

776
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,399
before the pandemic

777
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,640
that's really cool how many of you guys

778
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,520
had to go remote because of the pandemic

779
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,080
how fun was that

780
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,799
oh my gosh getting the computers that

781
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,720
everyone needed how many of you guys

782
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,640
have took a year to get computers

783
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,200
just to get computers my company it took

784
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,880
us about six to eight months to get

785
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,399
computers for everyone

786
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,000
we were using our own this

787
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
seven-year-old machine right here that's

788
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,399
what i was using thank god i spent a lot

789
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,799
of money on it when i first bought it

790
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,810
so um

791
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,440
[Music]

792
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,360
pretend that it's this fallout shelter

793
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,720
that you're stocking and you want to

794
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
stock up that's very important

795
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,880
especially for it keep track of your

796
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,080
equipment

797
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,919
not only keep track of your equipment

798
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,000
keep track of the fail rate of your

799
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,320
equipment you want to keep track of that

800
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,360
because

801
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,440
you can see what fails so you know how

802
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,760
much you want to have on hand those

803
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,320
people that went fully remote and if you

804
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,559
supplied everybody with everything

805
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,440
that's

806
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,200
mice that's laptops that's cords that's

807
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,679
cables the kind of security that you

808
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,240
needed the programs that you needed that

809
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,559
was a lot of stuff that was a lot of

810
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,559
work and you were forced into it how

811
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,720
many of you succeeded

812
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,559
i hope you all succeeded

813
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,320
you good okay you good back there okay

814
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
i hope you guys all succeeded at it but

815
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,240
it was hard to get the stuff

816
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,640
so knowing what you need and how much

817
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,200
you need and how often you need it

818
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,600
means that you can stack up

819
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,320
we're going through global shortages now

820
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
oh a tanker

821
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,000
coming out one of those cargo ships

822
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,679
coming across the pacific all that needs

823
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,600
to do is tip over and you can't get in

824
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,480
the certain usb cord that you need for

825
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,760
four months now so if you keep stock of

826
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,480
the stuff on hand you're able to better

827
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,159
run your

828
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,559
better run your departments so it's

829
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,480
really it's a really good idea to do

830
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,279
that

831
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,120
it'll also cut down on time and it'll

832
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,840
cut down on cost how many if you've seen

833
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,279
the prices rise

834
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,679
the prices are going up it's ridiculous

835
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,519
i tried to get a replacement cord for

836
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,480
this because i accidentally lost this

837
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,399
i found the one that i had because i

838
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,279
wasn't going to pay 300 for a power cord

839
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,720
so that's what happens when the machine

840
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,320
is seven years old if anyone has a new

841
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,600
computer you know you can just leave it

842
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,120
up here and i'll take it and i'll give

843
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
you mine um but no just kidding this

844
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,760
thing is beautiful i love it but um the

845
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,000
prices go up so you can cost save as

846
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,200
well so buying a cord now might help you

847
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,559
especially if you know you're not going

848
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,640
to rotate through your machines or

849
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,640
rotate through your equipment how many

850
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,360
of you have really old stuff

851
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,279
there were some power cords at a place

852
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,039
that i worked at previous that i didn't

853
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,120
even know i had never seen before there

854
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,360
were some connection cords to monitors

855
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,320
and i'm like

856
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,240
i've never seen this pin combination

857
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,320
before this is way before my time these

858
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,519
were old

859
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,760
so if you have old stuff that you insist

860
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,279
on using make sure you're able to

861
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,120
maintain that

862
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,760
so that's why you want to stock up

863
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,080
and the most important part

864
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,480
don't panic

865
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,640
you guys are all smart you guys are

866
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,120
great you're an i.t it's perfect

867
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,559
even if you're not an i.t you're still

868
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,840
smart you're here you're seeing me at

869
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,519
nine o'clock at night it's great

870
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,720
um

871
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,080
what you guys want to do is you want to

872
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,919
have plans in place

873
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,480
make sure that everything is going well

874
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,640
don't panic even if it's not going well

875
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,480
because you know what how many of you

876
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,240
have come across a problem that you were

877
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,279
never able to solve

878
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,480
okay yeah some of you but for the most

879
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,159
part you're able to get through as much

880
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,360
as you can

881
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,320
when you really need to and so if you

882
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,760
don't panic

883
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,080
what happens if you don't panic during

884
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,000
the cold war you're more likely to

885
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,600
survive if you don't panic during a

886
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,120
fallout event you're more likely to

887
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,679
survive so if you don't panic while

888
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,000
you're working even if that dreaded

889
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,159
ransomware comes up

890
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,080
you'll be able to go through it you'll

891
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,200
be able to survive you'll do well

892
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,880
and that's the real reason for civil

893
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,760
defense being prepared today means being

894
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,399
alive tomorrow so being prepared today

895
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,640
for you guys means that you will be able

896
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,360
to tackle anything that comes your way

897
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,000
are you successful maybe yes maybe no

898
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,360
but you'll be able to tackle it and

899
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,720
you'll be able to do the best that you

900
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,279
can do so i apologize this is really

901
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,720
really small

902
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,320
so basically it just goes over

903
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
everything that i've gone over so get to

904
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,279
know your co-workers create plans let

905
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,120
people know as much of the plans as you

906
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,200
can have dedicated channels of

907
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,560
communication

908
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,480
create a shelter a place where you can

909
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,839
go relax think gather yourself stock up

910
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,599
on the things you may need to try to be

911
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,839
ahead of the game and don't panic you

912
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,079
got this

913
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,280
so

914
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,119
any questions

915
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,199
so would uh indiana jones survive

916
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,560
getting in that

917
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,800
led fridge like he did in that last

918
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,599
horrible movie absolutely not i mean

919
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,399
just

920
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,440
just the psi from how close he was would

921
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,599
have just like exploded him from the

922
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,639
inside

923
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,159
no i i um um i got up and got popcorn at

924
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,399
that point i just couldn't i'm like oh

925
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,159
this is how the movie's gonna go we're

926
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,599
in trouble

927
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,000
so but no it was way he was way too

928
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,960
close

929
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,040
what they showed was

930
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,159
so

931
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,560
the blast that the house came from that

932
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,040
i showed you they had set up a faux town

933
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,599
to show the effects of the of the

934
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,920
nuclear destruction and so

935
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,560
indiana jones was in that town

936
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,200
essentially and so where he was he would

937
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,359
not have survived he would have died

938
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,280
from the psi he would have died from the

939
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,440
heat and he would have died from

940
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,359
embarrassment because it was just really

941
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,520
poorly done

942
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,560
any other questions

943
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,400
and it can be like about nuclear war two

944
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,960
what's up um so on the community uh

945
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,240
involvement level um

946
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,200
how uh how relevant is ham radio

947
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,000
infrastructure in that kind of scenario

948
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,040
context

949
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,119
uh hammer you was gonna save us all

950
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,480
honestly that is in any disaster

951
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,800
how many of you rely on your phones for

952
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,480
your news and your updates and your

953
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,800
weather alerts all right how many of you

954
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
are aware of how fragile the cellular

955
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,320
system is

956
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,200
so

957
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,800
um

958
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,520
ham radio helped in katrina ham radio

959
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,240
helped in sandy ham radio helps in

960
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,440
blizzards it helps in tornadoes um storm

961
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,760
chasers will often have ham radios with

962
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,440
them you can't

963
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,440
any technology that you can carry on you

964
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,079
you cannot rely on because of just how

965
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,640
the surfaces are set up the sun decides

966
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,400
to fart out a

967
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
solar flare it could take out the whole

968
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,040
system what's going to take over for it

969
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,640
ham radios

970
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,599
so it's very important in the cold war i

971
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,599
mean

972
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,760
in um the monsters are due on maple

973
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,280
street in the twilight zone and i know i

974
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,720
keep going back to the twilight zone but

975
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,119
they have a lot of cold war stuff in it

976
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,040
one of the guys is a ham radio operator

977
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,079
and they're like you're always in the

978
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,520
basement working on your radio

979
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,839
cold war is what really made ham radio

980
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,359
operations like explode so you had it at

981
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,079
the advent of radio so if you remember

982
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:54,880
like

983
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,839
1930s 1940s when there was like war in

984
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,280
the worlds

985
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,359
that's when individual hand radios were

986
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,760
really popular that's when people began

987
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,760
building their own ham radios but the

988
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,720
whole thing just took off in the 50s

989
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,760
during the

990
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,000
civil defense like you had ham radio

991
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,440
course

992
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,760
and you still see a lot of that today

993
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,599
yes any tips for survival when you're

994
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,359
living in a high rise

995
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,839
yeah actually i'm so glad you asked that

996
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,880
i know weird stuff like that so in a

997
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,560
high rise

998
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,240
no it's really bad my husband's like

999
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,560
shut up dude just like i've heard enough

1000
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,359
about

1001
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,119
so funny enough every time he goes to

1002
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,400
new york i quiz him on in a high rise

1003
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,000
so if you survive the initial explosion

1004
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,079
and you still have windows

1005
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,720
and you still have walls

1006
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,960
you want to be in the center of the high

1007
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,200
rise or in the basement so you don't

1008
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,960
want to be on the upper floors that's

1009
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,280
where the radiation can settle and it

1010
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,359
can seep down you don't want to be on

1011
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,839
the lower floor that's not a basement

1012
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,640
because that's where the radiation can

1013
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,000
also gather

1014
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,040
so if you had a choice the basement

1015
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,440
would be the best but the center of the

1016
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,240
building would be

1017
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,240
better than nothing

1018
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,160
and i quit him every time he goes on a

1019
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,160
business trip i'm like all right if a

1020
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,079
dirty bomb goes off where are you going

1021
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,440
to want to be

1022
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,680
it's just like no you're shelters he's

1023
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,040
like a

1024
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,000
gun

1025
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,800
but

1026
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,960
i i'll be the one laughing when he

1027
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,880
survives yes

1028
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,440
um i'm just wondering so after the two

1029
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,680
weeks is there any recommended type of

1030
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,160
food that would after actually be safe

1031
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
after nuclear glass

1032
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,359
yeah so you want sealed food

1033
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,400
so you want sealed food that has not

1034
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,320
been touched by radiation so you know

1035
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,400
radiation seeps into metal

1036
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,800
radiation can attach itself to metal so

1037
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,240
you want to stay away from anything

1038
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,240
metallic so like glass jars

1039
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,599
you want to stay away from produce that

1040
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,720
is grown in the ground after the event

1041
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,880
but if it is just sitting out in the

1042
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,839
field

1043
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,680
it's better than nothing you just want

1044
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,680
to decontaminate it

1045
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,630
so um

1046
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,320
[Music]

1047
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,880
food that is in like supermarkets so

1048
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,640
cancer and supermarkets as long as

1049
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,200
nothing is directly touching it

1050
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,599
you should be fine your own food should

1051
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,000
be fine and then anything that was

1052
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,520
already ripe

1053
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,359
should be okay

1054
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,920
but again it's like

1055
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,480
eat there's better options but if it's

1056
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,000
between starving

1057
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,680
you're not going to want to starve so

1058
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,680
you you know

1059
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,760
take your chances

1060
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,240
yes how did they ensure that the radio

1061
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,440
system you know that you mentioned the

1062
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,119
am radio station how do they ensure

1063
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,760
those kept operating after the event

1064
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,960
well because with radio um

1065
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,800
the way radio works is anyone can

1066
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,880
basically set up a radio station that's

1067
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,240
ham operation now i think with the 640

1068
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,880
and 1240 i think that's one of those hey

1069
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,640
we're prepared

1070
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,800
we're probably going to get blown up but

1071
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
we're prepared but the good thing about

1072
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,119
that is they can boost signals so anyone

1073
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,119
that survived they could boost the

1074
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,920
signal enough to reach it but it's more

1075
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,720
of you would be relying on ham radio

1076
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,520
operators who have access to 640 and

1077
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,160
1240 because

1078
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,760
there's no guarantee that the radio

1079
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,520
isn't going to be hit and where are your

1080
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,599
radio stations back then they're in the

1081
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,720
cities

1082
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,839
so

1083
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,400
i mean it's spotty at best

1084
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,240
but we're pretty sure that some of the

1085
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,880
radio could have continued but again it

1086
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,800
goes back to that local

1087
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,880
you know the local ham operator is going

1088
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,560
to help you out so you'll be able to

1089
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,880
pick up their bands

1090
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,480
yeah yes in the blue

1091
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,960
the day after is 100 realistic

1092
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,560
so the day after if you guys have not

1093
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,000
seen the day after if you want to be

1094
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,160
horrified for the rest of your life

1095
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,520
i recommend watching the day after it is

1096
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,880
um

1097
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,040
a portrayal of

1098
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,760
lawrence kansas and what would happen

1099
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,400
should a full-out nuclear war happen

1100
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,599
it is horrifying i saw it in high school

1101
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,520
before easter break once and it was the

1102
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,200
most depressing easter break i've ever

1103
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,440
had spring break

1104
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,520
no i was like crying in a corner the

1105
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,640
whole time

1106
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,560
but it really does show you the effects

1107
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,839
of nuclear war from

1108
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:34,560
before

1109
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,319
to

1110
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,400
many months after and the thing about

1111
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,640
nuclear war leading up to nuclear war is

1112
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,760
everyone thinks you're going to know

1113
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,800
about it

1114
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,480
the day after is a more accurate

1115
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,640
portrayal you just hear about little

1116
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,440
bits on the news oh this country invaded

1117
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,760
this country this country is moving

1118
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,359
things this way

1119
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,079
sound familiar yeah it was pretty scary

1120
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,119
there for a while um especially for me

1121
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,040
i'm like okay i gotta get everything in

1122
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,359
the shelter now it's not looking good

1123
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,359
but no it it really

1124
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,680
a new a full out nuclear war actually

1125
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,079
ramps up very slowly and then boom it

1126
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,560
hits one thing happens

1127
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,480
so i would highly recommend checking it

1128
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,560
out so yes according to all the data

1129
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,240
that they had it's 100 accurate

1130
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,760
we have one in the back

1131
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,160
two more questions oh no

1132
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,000
it's really late you're expecting me to

1133
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,400
remember two parts

1134
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
no no you can do two just do one at a

1135
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
time all right um

1136
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,480
water like if you if your bathroom

1137
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,079
happened to be the center of your house

1138
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,640
you were in a high rise in the middle

1139
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,119
and uh that seemed like the best option

1140
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,880
could you still wash your hands or

1141
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,040
shower

1142
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,880
i wouldn't recommend doing any of that

1143
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,079
you're going to want to save that to

1144
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,440
drink

1145
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,480
so you're going to save water to drink

1146
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,720
you can get water from many sources

1147
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,640
what's left over in your pipes it will

1148
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,640
get contaminated very quickly so you'll

1149
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,079
want to try to get that out as soon as

1150
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,640
possible also you can tap your

1151
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,319
hot water heater

1152
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,720
to get the water out of there but water

1153
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,560
is the thing that you need the most and

1154
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,319
so you are not going to want to shower

1155
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,480
it's going to get really rank

1156
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,000
in the shelter but you're not going to

1157
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,160
want to waste any of that for showering

1158
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,359
or anything you're going to want to save

1159
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,160
that all for food

1160
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,480
you can use that space for other things

1161
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,839
and you have a second part uh yeah so

1162
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,040
let's say

1163
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,599
russian terrorists managed to

1164
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:32,880
compromise

1165
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,119
a nuclear reactor of some story caused

1166
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,960
meltdown

1167
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,720
would that also have fallout or would

1168
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,000
that just be radiation it depends

1169
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,800
so if it's if they hack it and it goes

1170
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,160
boom

1171
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,760
then you're going to have a chernobyl

1172
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,640
thing

1173
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,920
um

1174
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,520
there's actually really no way that they

1175
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,599
could hack it in and not go boom because

1176
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:54,880
what are they just going to sit there

1177
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,640
and run the systems as normal no they're

1178
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,800
going to want to pull the rods out and

1179
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,720
stop the water from flowing so yeah i

1180
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,480
know it's basically going to go boom you

1181
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,240
can forgive me it's almost 10 o'clock

1182
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,400
it's like an hour past my bedtime

1183
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,839
so um

1184
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,560
right yeah it went boom and

1185
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,480
you know there was a contamination like

1186
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,400
i was living in germany a kid at the

1187
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,640
time yeah and i remember that we had a

1188
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,599
backyard with produce like onions and

1189
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,680
stuff and we had to refresh everything

1190
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,000
yep yeah and and they had to do that for

1191
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
about six to eight months afterwards

1192
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,520
because it took them that long to get

1193
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,400
the concrete sarcophagus on top of it

1194
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,480
and um

1195
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,359
yeah so yeah no my bad no it's gonna go

1196
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,520
boom and then you gotta figure out where

1197
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,839
it's gonna go and how many of it goes so

1198
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,760
chernobyl what many people don't realize

1199
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,680
is only part of chernobyl stopped

1200
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,520
working the rest of it's still working

1201
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,800
fukushima only only that one reactor

1202
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
stopped working the rest of it's still

1203
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,599
working so these are functional so if

1204
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,000
the entire plant goes up it might be a

1205
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,960
really really big problem if only one

1206
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,119
part of it goes up then it might be a

1207
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,800
chernobyl thing where it's like okay we

1208
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,119
gotta just get rid of everyone that is

1209
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,640
in the vicinity

1210
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,200
but it's relatively small

1211
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,920
as to how it could be

1212
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,040
yes

1213
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,880
so uh you mentioned

1214
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,000
decontamination a few times

1215
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,319
for somebody who's

1216
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,920
maybe not so prepared what would the

1217
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,560
best method like

1218
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,760
oh my gosh a broom i'm not even joking

1219
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,560
so

1220
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,440
the way that you get ill from fallout is

1221
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,599
it can sit on your skin you'll probably

1222
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,119
be okay

1223
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,440
it's when you inhale it and ingest it

1224
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,880
that's when the problem starts because

1225
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,119
then it just sits inside of you

1226
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,119
so the best way to decontaminate in the

1227
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,200
way they would recommend is you want to

1228
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,960
get clothes that are pretty much

1229
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,520
covering as much of you as possible

1230
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,319
and you want to

1231
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,359
go outside do your thing come back in

1232
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,240
get brushed off in a neutral area before

1233
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,160
you enter the shelter

1234
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,880
ditch your clothes that you were wearing

1235
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,040
come into another neutral part so think

1236
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,560
of it like an airlock but you don't

1237
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,640
really have one come into another

1238
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,839
neutral part get brushed off and then

1239
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,760
come back in dress and that's how you

1240
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,839
decontaminate you always want to have

1241
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,640
something cover in your face any orifice

1242
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,359
so like ears nose mouth you want to make

1243
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,680
sure that's all covered and you want to

1244
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,359
like stuff that could catch like hair

1245
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,720
you want to make sure that's covered

1246
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,760
so yeah that's how you would

1247
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,640
decontaminate

1248
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,359
comments on emp

1249
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,160
emp yes oh see that wasn't that big of a

1250
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,480
problem back in the 1950s and 60s but

1251
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,240
it's a really big problem now just

1252
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,920
assume that all your technology is not

1253
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,200
going to work

1254
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,040
it is your cars aren't going to work

1255
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,480
your phones aren't going to work tv's

1256
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,680
not going to work unfortunately the

1257
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,280
nintendo switch will probably be toast

1258
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,560
as well so

1259
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,040
you want to make sure that um you do

1260
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,359
have an analog radio you wanna and that

1261
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,960
just goes for anything like i said the

1262
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,839
sun could literally fart out a solar

1263
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,319
flare and the emp could knock everything

1264
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,680
out

1265
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,480
highly unlikely but that's that spending

1266
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,240
30 minutes of thinking about the worst

1267
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,839
thing that could happen

1268
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,599
so you just want to make sure always

1269
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,359
have an analog radio always have a way

1270
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,359
of getting information that is not

1271
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,839
directly reliant on technology

1272
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,599
yes was three mile island really as bad

1273
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,280
as people claim it was or was it just

1274
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,839
overblown

1275
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,599
if three mile island was really as bad

1276
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:34,880
as they claimed it would be people

1277
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,480
wouldn't be able to be around it right

1278
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,440
now

1279
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,079
um i think there was a real big push

1280
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,720
see nuclear weapons and nuclear

1281
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,800
facilities are two very different things

1282
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,839
but a lot of people think nuclear is bad

1283
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,000
um nuclear energy is some of the most

1284
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,359
efficient energy but there was

1285
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,000
a push to make it

1286
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,800
all

1287
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,640
not good because it's like oh we've got

1288
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,160
all this nuclear waste what are we going

1289
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,920
to do with it well if we've had it for a

1290
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,200
while we would be able to figure out

1291
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,040
what to do with it and we would be able

1292
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,319
to dispose of it so it was bad

1293
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,880
but i think

1294
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,319
it could have been a lot worse

1295
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,160
all right we got over there

1296
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,720
the civil

1297
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,520
i work with them

1298
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,200
um we actually don't have a spot

1299
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,680
so we have the old nike site which is

1300
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,079
where we give tours out of but like all

1301
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,559
of our collections um those are

1302
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,160
privately held

1303
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,960
so

1304
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,520
we do give tours of the nike site though

1305
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,359
so we do do that

1306
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:44,960
um you would contact us like on our

1307
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,280
facebook page to arrange that

1308
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,000
um but yeah as far as we're working on

1309
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,839
getting a site we've got a lot of cool

1310
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,359
stuff if you guys have been in the safe

1311
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:54,160
house

1312
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,920
some of our stuff is in the safe house

1313
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,280
it's really neat

1314
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,920
we've been pushing to get a museum

1315
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,240
i know my collection is available for

1316
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,480
people who want me to bring it wherever

1317
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,280
so um we're real cool like that but yeah

1318
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,000
so we are open to the public it's just

1319
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,440

00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,800
i think this might be a millennial

1325
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,520
question but do you have a shopping list

add at home water water

1329
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,520

have a wall of water bottles

1334
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,960
um but

1335
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,599
the water is the most important thing

1336
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,240
water peanut butter

1337
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,000
no seriously you laugh peanut butter

1338
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,880
lasts forever it's very high in calories

1339
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,960
and so keeping a couple of really large

1340
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,119
jars of peanut butter could sustain you

1341
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,839
for three or four weeks not even joking

1342
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,839
because the human body i think at rest

1343
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,920
at minimum needs something like 900 to

1344
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,040
1000 calories to survive and you can get

1345
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,680
that trust from a long distance runner

1346
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,280
you can definitely get that from a

1347
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,760
couple of tablespoons of peanut butter

1348
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,520
every couple of hours

1349
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,599
so yeah i recommend that um radio

1350
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,520
you want just a am fm radio just a

1351
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,760
regular am fm radio so really that's

1352
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,839
only the few things that you need canned

1353
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:28,720
food

1354
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,640
um is good to have as well but like i

1355
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,920
said you can

1356
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,760
do that with peanut butter

1357
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,820
and um

1358
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,160

1359
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,160
no this is a controversial thing but

1360
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,359
something that makes you happy a book

1361
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,079
a book of puzzles a deck of cards

1362
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,000
something to keep your mind at ease how

1363
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,480
many of you during quarantine the walls

1364
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,400
were closing in on you

1365
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,559
and it was awful and you just wanted to

1366
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,480
get outside or you wanted to do your

1367
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,400
favorite thing that you wanted to do now

1368
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,200
imagine being stuck in a shelter

1369
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,599
knowing that the world is ending

1370
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,359
you know you want something that makes

1371
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,760
you happy so if crossword puzzles make

1372
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,680
you happy have a couple of those down

1373
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,760
there if a certain board game makes you

1374
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,160
happy have that down there so yeah it's

1375
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,240
really an individual basis but water

1376
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,800
water water water everyone in this room

1377
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,559
should have at least two weeks of water

1378
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,720
in their house

1379
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,000
because like think about the ice storm

1380
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,640
the ice storm in texas and how people's

1381
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,319
pipes were freezing and they weren't

1382
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,079
able to get water think of katrina how

1383
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,000
they weren't able to get water

1384
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,559
human humans die within three days of

1385
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,160
not having water and i think it's like

1386
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,720
two weeks of not having food

1387
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,040
it's a lot of water water

1388
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,400
all right i think we have time for one

1389
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,559
more in the back of the blue hat that's

1390
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,520
you yes um

1391
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,680
don't don't use potassium iodide you

1392
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,760
don't know what kind of isotope is in

1393
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,680
the bomb and so it only works on

1394
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,440
specific isotopes

1395
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,480
so i mean you take it i guess if you

1396
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,599
want to

1397
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,119
but um

1398
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,680
yeah you don't know same thing

1399
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,760
um if you were to give me a list of

1400
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,280
shelter supplies you wanted like a

1401
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,839
dulcimeter a radiation detector don't

1402
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,760
even bother i mean you're either gonna

1403
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,119
get it or you're not

1404
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:20,559
you know it's like if you're in the

1405
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,559
shelter and you're detecting radiation

1406
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,240
well i mean you're pretty much screwed

1407
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,079
because that's your shelter

1408
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,280
so um it's cool to have i have one

1409
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,920
they're really neat to look at but you

1410
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,920
know i don't recommend it and

1411
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,880
i believe now like with the bombs like

1412
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,160
none of them

1413
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,720
use any of the isotopes that iodine

1414
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,000
would fix

1415
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,800
if

1416
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,720
if i remember correctly that's kind of

1417
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,520
digging back in the brain there

1418
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,000
so right well i'll be available for

1419
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,760
questions after this but thank you guys

1420
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,440
for sitting through this really weird

1421
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,040
interesting little thing that i put

1422
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,040
together

1423
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,160
cool

1424
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,839
