18
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,240

19
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,960
service pack 3.

20
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,079
cypricon

21
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,038

22
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,559
i'm just happy to be here at this point

23
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,680
so um

24
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,400
i'm exhausted bear with me

25
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,680
uh

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,840
what's amazing about this year's event

27
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,560
is we've had three years of planning now

28
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,400
anybody that's been here previous years

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,800
i think we had a riser

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,519
i think i was even more exhausted

31
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,200
and came off as a madman

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,840
it's true

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,599
what i want to talk about is

34
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,760
we're coming into cyphercon 5 with a

35
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,400
different vision than previously we're

36
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,319
going to start building year after year

37
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,120
of puzzles to turn into a monster of

38
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,519
puzzles and paths

39
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,760
so

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,640
when you're looking around the event

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,040
there's well over

42
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,239
250 puzzles hidden throughout the

43
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,000
conference

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,920
and if you earn your way through a lot

45
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,840
of these puzzles you can you can score a

46
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,360
lifetime badge

47
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,159
uh you can see it right there the

48
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,920
peacock

49
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,760
if you earn peacock you get lifetime

50
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,239
entry to the conference

51
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,640
if um

52
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,000
if you're looking to where to begin

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,080
the website has a place called cypher

54
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,360
forest

55
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,840
and with insightful forest is a hundred

56
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,519
plus puzzles

57
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,400
um

58
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,239
and lots of mystery and discovery and

59
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,640
creativity made by the community all put

60
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,839
into one area

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,640
as you're looking around the conference

62
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,239
i think there's three locations to

63
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,799
discover

64
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,400
the ultimate extreme order form for

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,200
cyphercon 6.

66
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,280
so if you discover a place where you can

67
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
purchase this badge

68
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,760
highly consider that

69
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,799
let me tell you why

70
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,400
so cyphercon

71
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,959
2016 the first year's conference here's

72
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,478
the program

73
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,798
on the back is a six fingered hand

74
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,919
six figured hand

75
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,400
year two

76
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,759
year three six figured hand so maybe

77
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,520
center count six is a big deal

78
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,160
so um

79
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,560
to be continued

80
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,720
so i was given this key to swallow by

81
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,840
the toy makers

82
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,400
we'll hold that off a little bit

83
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,720
um

84
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,840
thanks

85
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,560

86
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
patience

and and um

88
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,320
the last few years has been very

89
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,199
difficult on all of us

90
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,919
now is the opportunity to come back and

91
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,840
treat this like a party

92
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,560
look for opportunities to jump in and

93
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,479
contribute to the community

94
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,800

time

110

might have had a slide for uh catch the

111
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,199
con i wasn't going to get that out if

112

116
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,800
you that have been here in the past you

117
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
know that we handed out everybody a qr

118
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,680
code

119
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,960
you got that when you checked in and we

120
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,240
would use that as a way to encourage

121
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,600
people to go and socialize one of the

122
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,360
things that we wanted to do here that

123
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,199
not a lot of other cons do it from a

124
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,520
catch the five perspective is get people

125
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,319
out and interacting with others

126
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,600
post coping we without like maybe

127
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,639
encouraging everybody to go

128
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,000
exponentially interact with everybody

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
like face-to-face was not the best thing

130
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,560
to do for revision three so this year

131
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,720
we're backing off on that aspect of it a

132
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,000
little bit we're making it all about

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,720
having uh fun so in the ctc room where

134
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,319
they capture the con room we have a

135
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,240
giant puzzle that you'll be able to

136
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,680
interact with as you go throughout the

137
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,960
conference and

138
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,800
play at certain villages

139
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,080
after you complete certain things that

140
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,919
the villages will have you do you can

141
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,919
get a qr code you can then come into the

142
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,880
ctc room and then flip a switch on a

143
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,160
physical puzzle there's four different

144
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,720
teams we have a red blue green and pink

145
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,759
so you can pick a team and play

146
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,840
whichever one you want and the goal is

147
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,360
to flip switches to get your team's

148
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,199
color into the middle it's all for fun

149
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,039
it's just a way to kind of glue several

150
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,880
of the different villages together and

151
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,479
provide

152
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,319
just a fun way to have some competition

153
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,599
against each other but there are no

154
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,680
individual plants this year so it's more

155
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,960
about community and hacking than it is

156
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,479
about trying to beat each other in some

157
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,479
ctf challenge

158
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,440
so that's all i got if you have any

159
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,880
other questions we're right next door so

the proud parent of a carefully

380
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,800
handcrafted flamingo

381
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,279
each with over 100 hand-placed bits and

382
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,600
bobs they're just now a little over two

383
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,920
years old and their fuzzy pink feathers

384
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
are just coming in they're probably

385
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,000
still a little sleepy right now so while

386
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,160
they're still resting let's see what's

387
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,000
going on this morning at flyway camp

388
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,240
it's early morning at fly away camp and

389
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,959
already the camp is alive with activity

390
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,720
today we'll be going on a capture the

391
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,279
con trek at fly away camp and we'll be

392
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,959

396
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,759
lunch with us

397
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,360
i think we'll be having an excellent

398
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,600
time

399
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
well each camper in the pink shrimp

400
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,759
cabin gets their own parrot teacher or

401
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,519
coyote vendor to take care of for the

402
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,440
weekend and their responsibilities are

403
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,279
to greet that parrot or a coyote in the

404
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,519
mornings make sure they're clean and

405
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,279
learn how to care for and listen to a

406
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,199
parrot or coyote it's a big

407
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,720
responsibility but they get into it

408
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,779
[Music]

409
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,720
talking to them brings you closer to

410
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
them and listening to them when they

411
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,360
speak is like sharing time together so

412
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,120
you can get to know them better

413

418
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,559
village program with the guidance of

419
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,160
their counselors

420
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,919
campers can choose what villages they

421
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,319
visit with each providing hands-on

422
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,720
workshops and unique experiences

423
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,520
it's really fun learning how to use

424
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,400
vintage computers slaughter projects and

425
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,559
break into safes you can really feel

426
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,840
proud of that when you're done

427
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,480
myself i'm a parent of two flamingos and

428
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
camp was an opportunity to bring them

429
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,360
here and work here at the same time

430
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
so they can do their thing and i can do

431
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,360
my thing so we can still see each other

432
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,760
our private lake is staffed at all times

433

our sandy bottom and warm temperatures

436
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,480

campers

441
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,679
sometimes they can get sick if they're

442
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,160
too excitable and meet too many other

443
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,480
flamingos too quickly

444
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,760
over 10 lamingotritions monitor the camp

never talked to a parrot at the end of

483
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,200
two days they have so much confidence in

484
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,640
themselves and they're they're talking

485
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,559
to other campers by themselves doing

486
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,159
things they just never thought they

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,400
could do before

488
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,640
a kid was terrified of the coyotes but

489
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,080
he really wanted to see what they were

490
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,480
about and yesterday he said

491
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,880
i've learned an important lesson so i

492
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,720
said okay what's that

493
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,000
and he said

494
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,919
once they know you're not frightened of

them

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,559
and by solving easy puzzles they can

508
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,440
learn how rewarding cooperation can be

509
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,360
and some prizes will even let your

510
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,399
little flamingos live forever

511
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,080
we have animal care classes and campers

512
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,000
can work with our ostentation of

513
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,799
peacocks and dozens of farm animals

514
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,600
or i've never seen a peacock in my

515
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,840
entire lifetime they're so proud when

516
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,440
they walk around like they've really

517
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,400
accomplished something

518
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,840
if campers acquire an egg they can also

519
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,520
drop them off for incubation at the

520
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,679
badge village vending emporium

521
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,919
they can learn about the miracle of life

522
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,159
and campers can revisit their incubators

523
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,080
to see how their little ones are growing

524
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,240
up

525
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,880
people often ask us what's unique about

526
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,120
fly flyaway camp here at cyphercon and i

527
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,280
i think one of the things we provide is

528
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,120
it's just a lot of different and fun

529
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,440
activities for our flamingos

530
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,200
if it's your little one's first time at

531
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,240
flyaway camp in cyprecon we realize that

532
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,960
it's important for us to work as one big

533
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,919
community almost an extended family to

534
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,520
help ensure you're comfortable in the

535
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,679
villages or within classes

536
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,840
it's a big step and we're so glad you're

537
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,240
here with us

538
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,159
all right how's that

539
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,880
is it ridiculous

540
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,440
was i good was that good

541
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,720
you can tell growing up to use this

542
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,200
program

543
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,000
oh my gosh is it good

544
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,600
could you hear different could you hear

545
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,240
different like personalities

546
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,440
ridiculous

547
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,840
so clearly we take our uh

548
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,158
our badges incredibly seriously

549
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,559
here at cyprecon um

550
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,720
so this badge idea has actually been in

551
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,360
the works for about four years

552
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,679
after year two the cube badge um the

553
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,720
team

554
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,679
we were

555
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,760
slightly burnt out

556
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,280
but we were like

557
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,039
okay forget it next year we're doing a

558
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,720
flamingo badge

559
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,240
and then the year after we did the phone

560
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,320
badge and we said forget it next year

561
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,720
we're doing a flamingo badge

562
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,159
and then the next year we did the paper

563
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,799
tape badge and said forget it next year

564
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,559
the flamingo badge

565
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,039
so it's been going on since year two

566
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,520
and um

567
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,600
you know we've had this sitting in our

568
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,559
basement for three years now

569
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,039
and uh the theme of the conference was

570
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,039
the threat is real

571
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,360
so the threat is real

572
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,520
but of course we can't just do flamingo

573
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,440
badges and

574
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,039
so if you guys

575
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,960
who have badges if you guys feel your

576
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,000
badges

577
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
they're a little fuzzy

578
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,640
we flocked all the badges

579
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,960
because we could

580
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,320
um and

581
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,720
it was kind of interesting the

582
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,120
during the um

583
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,440
i guess when we were making these badges

584
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,760
all of the fabs that we normally rely on

585
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,520
in china had closed down for obvious

586
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,400
reasons

587
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,520
and so

588
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,440
all of the badges are made in america

589
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,880
the parts are hand placed so if there's

590
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,400
a bad solder job you can blame me

591
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,039
and

592
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,600
in your in your bags for those who got

593
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,679
badges you'll also have received a pair

594
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,600
of scissors

595
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,799
if you want to

596
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,559
keep them on your lanyard just so you're

597
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,880
aware you have them they go with this

598
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,840
book

599
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,360
and if you look at have looked at this

600
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,720
book there are 25 cut out outfits

601
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,120

602
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,039
