[Music]

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,700
thank you

3
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:29,238
[Music]

4
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,218
all right

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,460
foreign

6
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,860
I am a certified rescue scuba diver and

7
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,920
I also work in information security it

8
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,200
turns out that these fields have a lot

9
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,299
in common

10
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:16,680
primarily that there there's just

11
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,560
inherent risk in what we do in order to

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,259
reap the benefits we have to understand

13
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,920
and assume a certain level of risk

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,000
secondly Panic makes everything worse in

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,340
both situations when you panic you're

16
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,200
going to compound all of your problems

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,900
and the third thing that I find that

18
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,520
they have in common is that our Natural

19
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,939
Instincts are often wrong and so we do

20
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,900
have to learn how to train our minds and

21
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,939
train our bodies to respond in a way

22
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,500
that is going to be productive and

23
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,479
helpful for the situation and to help us

24
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,659
get to the best outcome

25
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:55,619
um

26
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,600
so a little bit of background on myself

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,460
just so you have a sense of where I'm

28
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,320
coming from and kind of how I developed

29
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,140
my perspective I am the founder and CEO

30
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,659
of a Communications consultancy called

31
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,959
discernible and we focus exclusively on

32
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,180
helping cyber security teams privacy

33
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,640
teams and risk teams and how to

34
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,620
communicate to other stakeholders so

35
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,540
whether that's their Executives and

36
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,440
business teams their employees their

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,780
customers sometimes media and the public

38
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,340
I'm talking about Security in in privacy

39
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,319
and in really productive and easy to

40
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,879
understand ways for all of those

41
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,520
different stakeholders prior to starting

42
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,459
this company I led security privacy and

43
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,519
Engineering Communications at Uber as

44
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,620
well as security Communications at

45
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,160
Facebook and ATT and before that I was a

46
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,200
consultant at another company working

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,879
with a bunch of other companies on

48
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,640
exactly the same thing so I have gone

49
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,360
very very deep in one particular area of

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,580
cyber security

51
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,620
I started my undergraduate studies in

52
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,860
Marine Biology that's actually where the

53
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,500
scuba diving started in my life

54
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,660
also probably why you're going to see a

55
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,860
lot of shark photos in this presentation

56
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,239
but I ended up getting a master's in

57
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,340
corporate Communications and So I

58
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,080
Married those two

59
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,640
um

60
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,500
experiences into a career in cyber

61
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,720
security because it turns out that

62
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,019
sharks and hackers have a lot in common

63
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:30,840
in communicating about them depends on a

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,140
lot of the same principles in terms of

65
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,420
how do we talk about things that that do

66
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,640
have inherent risk but that we can't

67
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,739
completely avoid in order for our lives

68
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,519
to be productive I'm also a co-organizer

69
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,799
and the Press Department lead at Defcon

70
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,620
so if any of you are familiar with that

71
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,280
um

72
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,239
uh event I'm involved in that and as I

73
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,500
mentioned at the beginning I'm also a

74
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,720
certified rescue scuba diver are there

75
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,040
any other

76
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,980
certified divers here in the room

77
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,519
amazing if you're already certified I

78
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,099
highly recommend looking into Paddy's

79
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,159
psychological diver course it's only a

80
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,580
couple years old but it is amazing and

81
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,840
I'm going to touch on a lot of the

82
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,820
principles from that course throughout

83
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,260
this presentation

84
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,238
thank you

85
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,340
does anybody know what the number one

86
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,580
cause of diving emergencies is water

87
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,840
filthy

88
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,520
it's poor judgment

89
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,380
and you want to know what causes poor

90
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,000
judgment

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,340
Panic is one of them

92
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,919
um but also sometimes we do we make poor

93
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,419
choices even before the emergency

94
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,660
happens that leads to the emergency

95
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,199
right how many times have we been in a

96
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,300
security incident that should have been

97
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,699
very small and should have been easy to

98
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,740
mitigate but then our CES is something

99
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,419
really stupid on the news and now it's

100
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,220
like a full-blown Incident That's

101
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,040
impacting stock price right

102
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,720
um so we want you to think as we go

103
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,940
through this today think about

104
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,600
um

105
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,139
where where are we making decisions and

106
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,740
where does poor judgment come into play

107
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,419
throughout the entire incident response

108
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,160
process because when I focus

109
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,160
particularly on Executives and I'll get

110
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,680
to this later on they have a very

111
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,320
important and critical role in incident

112
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,840
response particularly as it relates to

113
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,259
judgment and if they are distracted with

114
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,520
other things

115
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,220
or if they are panicked

116
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,620
their decision-making abilities are

117
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,220
going to be impacted as well and so it's

118
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,919
something that we can do as the security

119
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,680
team to actually Focus their attention

120
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,960
on the right things make sure that

121
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,199
they're not being overtaken by Panic so

122
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,940
that the things that they are

123
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,800
responsible for where we need them to

124
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,360
make a decision they're actually

125
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,320
optimized and perform

126
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,440
so I'm going to start a little bit just

127
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,740
with the background about what Panic is

128
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,259
and how it impacts us so Panic

129
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,800
essentially when we feel like that that

130
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,139
sense of anxiety or Panic it triggers

131
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:26,520
our primitive brain so the amygdala is

132
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,660
located

133
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,280
um the back of your brain

134
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,520
uh and it's responsible for uh your

135
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,720
fight flight or freeze response phrases

136
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,940
happen all the time to panicked divers

137
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,400
they just go limit

138
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,220
um sometimes they will also

139
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,560
um as I mentioned sometimes our Natural

140
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,240
Instincts aren't always the right thing

141
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,819
to do when you're underwater and you're

142
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,060
under pressure and something goes wrong

143
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,699
um you know a lot of times our natural

144
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,919
instinct is I just need to get to the

145
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,860
surface where I can breathe

146
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,340
and I've seen Panic divers shoot to the

147
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,440
surface despite having everything that

148
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,919
they needed to breathe underwater they

149
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,900
still had air their equipment was

150
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,180
functioning just fine but they get

151
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,220
scared and they race to the surface and

152
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,560
this is particularly dangerous in scuba

153
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,840
diving because as you get closer to the

154
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,039
surface

155
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,340
of the the pressure around you decreases

156
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,419
and so the air inside you expands and

157
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,060
it's really easy to blow Along by

158
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,060
shooting to the surface too quickly

159
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,680
into

160
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,199
at the same time in our primitive brain

161
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,139
is being triggered by this Panic this

162
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,900
alarm Bell in our mind it's also

163
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,900
inhibiting the more evolved parts of our

164
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,539
brain so you know things in your frontal

165
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,419
cortex like uh verbal thought judgment

166
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,780
and planning so not only is panic in

167
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,300
incredibly uncomfortable experience to

168
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,280
just to just go through it actually

169
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,819
makes it so much harder for us to

170
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,599
um

171
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,060
actually execute those higher level

172
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,400
cognitive functions that we need in

173
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,500
something like in underwater emergency

174
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,099
or security incident

175
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:20,160
and two when problems occur whether it's

176
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,879
a security incident or you know a diving

177
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,180
emergency our responses can either help

178
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,500
us lead us to a fix of the situation or

179
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,779
it can make it worse right it's one of

180
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,940
the reasons why we train over and over

181
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,640
and over again not just as rescue divers

182
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,860
but as incident response professionals

183
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,760
so that a lot of what we need to do in

184
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,420
that moment is muscle memory for us

185
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,360
I can identify an emergency underwater

186
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,320
very quickly so that I know what to do

187
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,320
to mitigate that situation right but the

188
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,339
more stress that we feel the more likely

189
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:03,720
we are to actually we're going to lose

190
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,180
the ability to remove that source of

191
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,120
stress right if I'm with a diver who is

192
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,220
panicked because

193
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,440
um maybe they got a cramp in their leg

194
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,180
or they're having

195
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,220
um pain in their ears because they have

196
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,220
an equalized properly The more stress

197
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,380
they get the harder it's going to be for

198
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,200
me to tell them the right things that

199
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,839
they need to do which is why as rescue

200
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,180
divers we are trying on how to do things

201
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,839
regardless of the panic diver would want

202
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,019
us to be doing uh there's even scenarios

203
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,880
that we have to practice where if they

204
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,100
are panicked we can go behind their tank

205
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,100
where they can't reach us so they can't

206
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,380
pull on our Regulators or our tubes or

207
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,320
anything and we can safely you know get

208
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,820
them to the surface where help is

209
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,920
waiting but it's important to keep in

210
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,899
mind that again The more stress we get

211
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,300
the worse it's going to be right so

212
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,680
those of us that are involved in

213
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,500
incident response all the time it's

214
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,320
helpful for us to you know develop these

215
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,080
skills on our own but also to think

216
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,000
about the other stakeholders and those

217
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,100
Executives who are in this situation

218
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,980
with us as well

219
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,600
yeah

220
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,080
so to top that off uh perceived threats

221
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,839
are enough to trigger our Panic response

222
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,000
right so even if you're not actually in

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,519
danger and I took this photo by the way

224
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,260
not in danger

225
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,839
when you're actually in uh just the

226
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,420
thought of being in danger is enough to

227
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,420
trigger your amygdala and activate that

228
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,420
limbic system which leads to that Panic

229
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,540
response and this this is um a positive

230
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,880
feedback loop between the physiological

231
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,100
response and how our brain responds

232
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,680
right so if any of you were in The

233
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,260
Meditation session this morning that was

234
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,720
in this room they went through a

235
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,399
breathing exercise

236
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,880
which I use a lot not only in scuba

237
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,279
diving but also in incident response

238
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,700
coaching because I need both your body

239
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,540
and your brain to understand that you're

240
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,100
not in danger

241
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,760
or they could you know negatively impact

242
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,399
um each other right so if your heart is

243
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,800
racing that actually sends a signal to

244
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,019
your brain that there's a threat and

245
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,760
then it's this positive feedback loop

246
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,680
and they feed off of each other so we

247
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,320
have to learn how to interrupt that

248
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,440
process in order to convince our brains

249
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,779
not to panic right

250
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,100
and so the number one rule we have in uh

251
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,620
rescue diving which is probably going to

252
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,060
seem very familiar to Security

253
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,640
Professionals as well is that the best

254
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,040
way to deal with an emergency is to stop

255
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,680
it before it starts right and I'm not

256
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,660
only talking about like our technical

257
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,000
defenses sure we wish we could stop all

258
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,980
like security incidents that's not a

259
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,420
reality

260
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,860
um but it doesn't have to be an

261
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,200
emergency we decide whether or not it's

262
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,060
an emergency by the way that we respond

263
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,279
to it

264
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,980
and so in diving we have a little bit of

265
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,959
a checklist that we'll go through before

266
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,720
we get in the water right just to make

267
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,640
sure let's make sure that everything is

268
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,399
working properly and that we've set

269
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,860
expectations before we get into that

270
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,100
situation of risk right so I look at all

271
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,380
of the divers that are in our group is

272
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,500
anybody nervous are they anxious are

273
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,100
they anti- are they tired did they get

274
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,519
enough to eat is anybody seasick right

275
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,920
motion sickness can have a um have a

276
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,839
huge impact on our mental abilities

277
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,820
while we're diving as well so I'm

278
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,399
looking at all of those things about my

279
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,560
diver to understand what is their state

280
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,180
of mind

281
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,339
um and how are they feeling in in that

282
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,680
moment before we even get into the water

283
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,139
right I do the same thing with

284
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,440
Executives from day one I am scanning

285
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,380
these people to understand what makes

286
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,480
them tick what motivates them how do

287
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,880
they respond to stress right cyber

288
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,860
security is not the only risk or the

289
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,440
only issue that Executives have to deal

290
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,600
with right and so I want to understand

291
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,240
how do they deal with other types of

292
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,700
risk and other stressful situations

293
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,040
I'm also thinking about the environment

294
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,019
when we're going to a specific dive site

295
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,480
I'm thinking are there is there an

296
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,940
overhead environment where I live in

297
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,160
Mexico we have a lot of underwater caves

298
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,320
and you know getting hit in the head

299
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,959
with stalactite is not ideal so I'm

300
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,820
thinking about what is the environment

301
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,180
like not only so that I can prepare but

302
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,100
so that I can communicate to the other

303
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,860
divers what to expect right because

304
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,079
nobody really likes surprises underwater

305
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,260
unless it's a really amazing uh you know

306
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,360
encounter with an eagle ray

307
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,279
the next thing that we do is we go

308
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,680
through a dive plan we brief all of the

309
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,200
diverse before we get in the water what

310
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,260
to expect what is our anticipated death

311
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,260
right you have a finite amount of air in

312
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,660
your tank and you have a finite amount

313
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,839
of nitrogen that your body can't absorb

314
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,180
when you're under pressure right and so

315
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,540
we have a plan for every diet and we

316
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,399
talk about that as a group

317
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,019
uh in fact

318
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,660
uh the same that we have is plan your

319
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,720
dive and dive your plan now this is

320
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,279
going to come into play a little bit

321
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,839
later when we get into some of the

322
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,779
security incident specifics but I often

323
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,399
hear people say oh yeah we have an

324
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,959
incident response plan but we don't

325
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,600
follow it because it you know it it

326
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,639
drives me crazy when people say you have

327
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,680
to have a plan but you know nobody ever

328
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,540
really used to say I'm going to tell you

329
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,699
why there's two problems with that

330
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:51,360
one is that if your plan doesn't work

331
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,000
change it because you need to have a

332
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,459
plan you have to you don't know if your

333
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,620
best most experience incident response

334
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,820
team members

335
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,160
are going to come to work that day

336
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,380
or are going to be

337
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,420
um you know able to participate that day

338
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,820
maybe they're out sick maybe they're

339
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,160
having a family emergency you have to

340
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,980
have a plan that other people can follow

341
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,199
not just the people who have done this a

342
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,720
million times before the second thing is

343
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,519
that if you go through a really serious

344
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,920
incident that gets public exposure or

345
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,100
requires a regulatory reporting

346
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,560
obligation The Regulators are going to

347
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,380
come check and look at your plan and

348
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,660
whether or not you followed it it is

349
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,639
worse to have a plan that you didn't

350
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,220
follow because The Regulators will want

351
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,320
to know why you deviated from your plan

352
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,899
and if you have a lot of deviations from

353
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,160
your plan

354
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,860
then you didn't really have a plan

355
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,839
to

356
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,399
and I'll talk about this a little bit

357
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,620
later it's important to practice your

358
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,660
plan over and over and over again as

359
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,880
many times as you can through your daily

360
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,440
operations

361
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,720
so that your plan is something that you

362
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,579
can't actually follow that you can trust

363
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,800
and that you have confidence in and not

364
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,620
just you as a security team but your

365
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,199
executive team as well your Executives

366
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,959
will jump in the middle of your process

367
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,860
if they don't trust it if they need if

368
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,779
they're having this you know they need

369
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,699
to have this cathartic experience to do

370
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:22,139
something because believe me they did

371
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:23,760
not get to where they were by sitting

372
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,540
still

373
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,019
right and uh so we need to give them

374
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,820
specific things to focus on and we need

375
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,620
to give them a plan that they understand

376
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,779
that they believe in and that they trust

377
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,420
so that they will follow it

378
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,160
and then the last thing we do with our

379
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,440
diverse uh is that we check all of their

380
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,480
gear right

381
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,459
um are your Regulators working so that

382
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:46,620
you can breathe that's important scuba

383
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,320
divers have two Regulators we have an

384
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,180
extra in case we need to share air with

385
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,220
a buddy uh in case they run out of there

386
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,199
or in case there's a malfunction in our

387
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,320
primary regulator we also need to make

388
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,820
sure that all of the equipment we have

389
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,339
for buoyancy which is you know whether

390
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:04,319
or not you're floating uh in the water

391
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,359
if you're more dense or less dense than

392
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,980
the water that you're in we need to make

393
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,540
sure that all of that equipment is

394
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,939
working as well I was actually talking

395
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:14,160
to a fellow diver earlier today who's

396
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,299
talking about

397
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:18,419
um how he had increased or decreased his

398
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,939
air consumption which is a huge uh

399
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,220
achievement for any scuba divers to use

400
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,720
the least amount of air as possible

401
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,660
because then your dive can last longer

402
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,840
um and you know the easiest way to to

403
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,740
improve your air consist consumption is

404
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,840
to improve your buoyancy right being

405
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,360
able to just float and Coast through the

406
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,400
water with very little effort and so we

407
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,900
want to make sure that all of that is

408
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,240
working if you're too heavy or if you

409
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,520
don't have enough weight in the water

410
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,919
you will struggle the whole time and not

411
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,919
only will you go through air faster but

412
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,020
it also especially for new divers can be

413
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,419
an incredibly triggering experience to

414
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,740
not feel like you have control

415
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,940
and so in both scuba diving and

416
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,860
um in cyber security we need to

417
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,080
understand the challenges that we might

418
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,960
face during an incident and we need to

419
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,419
ensure that everyone including our

420
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,299
Executives have the proper skills and

421
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:22,820
tools to deal with those challenges

422
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,620
[Music]

423
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,840
so when it comes to Executives as I

424
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,600
mentioned I'm constantly monitoring

425
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,280
um their their state of mind I'm

426
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,780
constantly monitoring their abilities

427
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,460
what are they good at what are they not

428
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,919
good at what are their blind spots

429
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,480
um and this isn't necessarily because

430
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,720
I'm going to tell them how to fix it

431
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,600
again depending on their personality but

432
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,940
I may need to compensate for that right

433
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,179
when we dive with with newly certified

434
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,840
divers we have extra weights with us we

435
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,880
will bring extra masks with us just in

436
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,080
case they have an issue with their math

437
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,919
we have to be prepared to kind of cover

438
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,080
the blind spots and the weaknesses of

439
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,660
the folks that that we're working with

440
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,860
and a lot of that just has to do with

441
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,900
with their experience

442
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,160
um as well as their temperament

443
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,840
we also need to be mindful of the tools

444
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,360
that the executives have right in terms

445
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,120
of how are they getting information what

446
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,919
things do they have access to does RCA

447
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,900
have access to a Twitter account that we

448
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,280
don't know about that's going to cause

449
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,679
an issue with policy right those types

450
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,299
of things matter

451
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,760
um and also when I think about tools I

452
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,500
also think about like channels of

453
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,780
information who are the resources and

454
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,660
who are the people that the this CEO is

455
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,780
going to call before they call me or ask

456
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,419
to call me I need to know who's in that

457
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,940
Circle and who's who has their ear

458
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,340
because that's going to again impact

459
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,400
their perception of fear and risk and

460
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,520
comfort with the entire situation

461
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,919
I also think about their experience

462
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,900
right and

463
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,280
everybody thinks they have more

464
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,679
experience than they do usually by the

465
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,960
time they become an executive

466
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,880
um but I'm I'm more

467
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,340
interested in the type of experience

468
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,860
they have more so than the quantity of

469
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,260
experience so for example uh we get lots

470
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,720
of diverse where I live in Mexico a lot

471
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,520
of tourists will come also I have 400

472
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,880
Dives but they're all in the ocean

473
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,520
you have a lot more space to safely mess

474
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,160
up in the wide open ocean and if you

475
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,980
come diving with us in the caves your

476
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,140
buoyancy has to be on point when you go

477
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,179
cave diving you just don't have a room

478
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,280
to go up and down you're not going to

479
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,320
make it through the narrow passages and

480
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,820
you're going to

481
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,240
um damage your body or your equipment if

482
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,860
you're constantly hitting the rock

483
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,320
formations and so when I'm thinking

484
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,299
about executive experience I'm not just

485
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:56,039
thinking about you know how many

486
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,480
incidents have they been through but

487
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,520
what types of incidents have they been

488
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,580
through what types of security

489
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:07,140
um uh experience and Leadership do they

490
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,960
have right it's very different if all

491
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,700
they've ever gone through is ransomware

492
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,620
compared to okay now we have a really

493
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,020
irate like bug Bounty researcher who's

494
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,780
you know on Twitter and and pulling a

495
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,039
lot of media attention towards us

496
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:25,260
and the last thing that I look at is the

497
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,780
executive's comfort with this subject

498
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,840
matter specifically and when I talk

499
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,419
about Comfort what I'm actually looking

500
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:36,299
for is is there public content from this

501
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,880
company about cyber security other than

502
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,740
you know we've had a breach do they talk

503
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,260
about security all the time are they

504
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,260
engaged in the security Community are

505
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,120
they at conferences are they sharing

506
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,100
best practices are they engaged in

507
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,500
standards bodies I've been looking for

508
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,500
evidence that this company is

509
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,220
comfortable talking about security

510
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,679
when they don't have to

511
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,900
that makes a big difference

512
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,419
so here's just a couple examples that I

513
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:07,740
um

514
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,059
um those on the left are blog posts

515
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,580
about specific incidents

516
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,200
um one is from clapboard the other one's

517
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,000
from GitHub it doesn't really matter the

518
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,260
company

519
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,240
um but this is a lot more information

520
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,600
than they had to share publicly but both

521
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,280
of these companies have a very long

522
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,380
history and a good reputation of doing

523
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,900
this on a regular basis that means that

524
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,419
when they have really serious security

525
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,340
incidents all of their Executives

526
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,740
already know their routine and they

527
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,299
already know that it's not the end of

528
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,640
the world to talk about when bad things

529
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,159
happen and in fact both of these

530
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,799
companies reputation

531
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,380
is increased by the fact that they are

532
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,539
this transparent about their security

533
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,659
experiences the information on the right

534
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,020
actually comes from Uber's ESG report

535
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,460
from 2021

536
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,320
um this is particularly important not

537
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,179
because of the numbers themselves but

538
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:09,600
because of how much bureaucracy it takes

539
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,820
to share this level of detail with your

540
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,520
investors right so when I'm thinking

541
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,320
about whether or not executives are

542
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,179
comfortable with the subject matter of

543
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,659
security in general I'm looking for

544
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:22,860
proof

545
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,840
that they're willing to talk about these

546
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,820
things when they don't have to and that

547
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,220
they understand the value in being

548
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,140
transparent and having nuanced

549
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,559
conversations with stakeholders

550
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,659
and so it's exactly the cross-functional

551
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:40,020
approvals and the risk whether real or

552
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,020
perceived where when I see these things

553
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,720
that tells me that this company under

554
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,159
the leadership of their Executives

555
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,020
because these executives are involved in

556
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,320
a lot of these um public facing content

557
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,120
creation that they're they're

558
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,919
comfortable with the subject matter they

559
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,299
can talk about it in a way that doesn't

560
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,460
make them feel like the house is on fire

561
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,200
just because they said the word cyber

562
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,820
right

563
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,980
and again keep in mind that even

564
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,860
perceived risk

565
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,480
has a lot to do with how Executives

566
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,659
react to the situation right

567
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,200
it's why we um I actually there were

568
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,480
um I had a number of people uh in my

569
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,940
network tell me about with with the OCTA

570
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,159
incident a couple months ago was it

571
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:25,320
months ago or weeks ago who knows what

572
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,980
days are anymore

573
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,740
um

574
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,440
but they you know the companies were too

575
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,539
scared to talk to their customers about

576
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:37,260
their exposure to the um the OCTA issue

577
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,440
even when their exposure was Zero I love

578
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,360
when our exposure is zero because we can

579
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,820
talk about it very safe

580
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,940
there is no risk in talking about a zero

581
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,760
exposure but the companies were

582
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,500
concerned that oh if we talk about

583
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,200
security it's going to incite panic it's

584
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,419
not actually we need to normalize

585
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:59,700
talking about Security on a regular

586
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,820
basis so that when real hits the

587
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,220
fan that's not the first introduction

588
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,440
that people have to our security team

589
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,140
our strategy or any of our defenses

590
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,760
right this needs to be something that

591
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,860
we're comfortable talking about all the

592
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,340
time just in the way that I need you

593
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,260
know scuba divers to be comfortable with

594
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,559
their Gear with the environment and with

595
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,240
the process and procedures that they've

596
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,840
been trained on

597
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,840
and so when we talk about specifically

598
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,760
preventing executive academic there's a

599
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,380
couple best practices that I've learned

600
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,120
throughout my career that I want to

601
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,779
share with you today

602
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,220
the first is have a really really good

603
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,080
response plan I mentioned this at the

604
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,539
beginning it's so important that your

605
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:48,779
plan is actually enhancing and playing

606
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:50,760
to the abilities of your executive team

607
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,760
if you have an executive who is a

608
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,980
terrible public speaker for God's sakes

609
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,360
don't put them on TV okay

610
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,960
um it also needs to increase the Comfort

611
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,240
level of these Executives every time

612
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,679
they go through this plan with you

613
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,720
should make them more and more

614
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,000
comfortable not just with incident

615
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,120
response but with security in general

616
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,799
um and so you'll see later on when I

617
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,299
talk about why it's so important that we

618
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:21,179
use our response plans as often as we

619
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,840
possibly can even if it's a minor

620
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,860
incident

621
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,260
and then finally the plan needs to be

622
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,120
flexible it needs to be sustainable

623
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,340
right if the plan is so rigid that

624
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,620
you're constantly deviating from it your

625
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,900
plan sucks so there needs to be

626
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,419
flexibility built into the plan not

627
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:43,080
necessarily prescriptive

628
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,860
stocks at every turn I've had clients

629
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,140
say can we get a template for you know

630
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,460
would we need to make a public

631
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,620
announcement about a data break I'm like

632
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,659
no we definitely cannot because it will

633
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:56,340
be terrible it will sound like you used

634
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,140
a template it will sound like your

635
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,419
lawyer's roommate and it's not going to

636
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,480
have the empathy or the context of the

637
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,659
situation but what you can have is a

638
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,820
plan for who's going to decide what to

639
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,279
say and who else is going to contribute

640
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,980
to that and what is the SLA for all of

641
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,600
those contributors to make sure we can

642
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,039
get this out as quickly as possible

643
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,460
thank you

644
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,799
and so we mentioned this

645
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,380
um a little earlier about really

646
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,020
steering the executive attention towards

647
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,659
the things that are most important for a

648
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,539
successful incident response so uh

649
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:36,299
attention is a higher order process um

650
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:37,980
within our brain meaning that it

651
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,559
actually directs other processes right

652
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,080
it helps us assess the situation and

653
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,140
then it's actually going to allocate the

654
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,779
cognitive resources right it tells us

655
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:50,100
um what to be thinking about what

656
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,500
decisions need to be made and so it

657
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,360
really matters where we're focusing

658
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,539
people's attention during an incident

659
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:01,080
it also directs our perceptual processes

660
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,539
and influences how we receive the

661
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:06,240
information about the situation if

662
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,340
executives are focusing on the wrong

663
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,679
thing it's not going to matter how many

664
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,480
times you throw a fax at them about the

665
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,059
security investigation they are obsessed

666
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,460
with this other thing over here and

667
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,380
we've got to pull their attention off of

668
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,880
that thing that doesn't matter because

669
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,500
we need them to focus on the most

670
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,279
important tasks again

671
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,799
and attention is heavily impacted by our

672
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,140
thoughts right this is why I care so

673
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,900
much about monitoring and scanning

674
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,600
getting to know what makes all of these

675
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,460
Executives tick because their beliefs

676
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,960
and their expectations are going to

677
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,400
impact the way that they think about

678
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,860
what's going on and their emotional

679
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,200
state whether they are fearful or

680
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,659
anxious about what's happening is also

681
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,460
going to steer their attention towards

682
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,320
what they perceive to be the threats

683
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,380
right which may be something like a

684
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,900
media inquiry I have never seen a

685
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,480
company go through a breach that went

686
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,640
and then went out of business because of

687
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,400
a media statement the media can wait

688
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,620
that is not your number one priority

689
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,860
during an incident do you eventually

690
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,900
need to have that conversation and

691
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,120
publicly share the details yes of course

692
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,700
and I'm not suggesting that you ignore

693
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,679
um media questions

694
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,880
um but

695
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,039
every company I have ever encountered

696
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,960
can survive

697
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,960
a bumpy day in the news right a bumpy

698
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,340
day in the news is not going to take you

699
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,179
down

700
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,399
if you are not transparent when you do

701
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,220
communicate or if you try to minimize

702
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,899
what's happening when you communicate

703
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:38,880
that's what's really going to have an

704
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,779
impact

705
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,779
um long term for your business

706
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,179
and so why does all of this matter in

707
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:47,340
terms of the executive attention and

708
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,600
making sure that they're focused on the

709
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,640
right things it's because there's a

710
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,380
large range of important information

711
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,720
it's actually competing for executives

712
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,020
attention during an incident

713
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,559
and our response plans need to help them

714
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,200
focus on the most important tasks I

715
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,460
mentioned this at the very beginning

716
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,520
where we need Executives to be focused

717
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,100
on the decisions and the judgments that

718
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,260
only they can make because of the role

719
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,120
and Authority that they have within the

720
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,399
organization

721
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,760
and this is best achieved when spoiler

722
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,820
alert they're not hammocked we want them

723
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,720
to make smart decisions and to have the

724
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,000
best clearest judgment possible so

725
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,640
keeping our Executives out of a panic

726
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,340
mode helps us get to the best outcomes

727
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,700
from a security perspective as well

728
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,279
and so I want to introduce you to this

729
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,500
um concept of task loading this is

730
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,200
something that we talk about a lot

731
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,100
um in rescue diving uh because it has a

732
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,700
huge impact on diver panic and things

733
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,279
that could trigger diver Panic so

734
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,799
um as humans our capacity to process

735
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,020
information is limited our brains can

736
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,760
only do so much at once right

737
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,120
and new and unfamiliar tasks require a

738
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,220
significant amount of this limited

739
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,580
capacity so for a new diver if they are

740
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,340
using new equipment if they are diving

741
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,279
with a camera for the first time if they

742
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,140
have you know if their wetsuit doesn't

743
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,940
fit quite right and they're kind of

744
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,760
struggling with it these things take up

745
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,480
a lot of space in our minds and that

746
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,539
pulls that capacity away from other

747
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,840
things

748
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:39,899
um and as as new tasks build up or is

749
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,760
you know we're we're loaded with more

750
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,799
and more simultaneous tasks we're

751
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:45,480
actually going to tap out our capacity

752
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,240
to be able to accept new information or

753
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,120
to do additional tasks fortunately more

754
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,240
familiar tasks require less conscious

755
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,940
effort right this is why you know for

756
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,500
those of us that are trained as rescue

757
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,600
divers we can identify things quickly

758
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,940
and respond to them in a more calm and

759
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,659
relaxed manner to actually mitigate the

760
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:07,460
emergency

761
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:11,100
and prevent product within ourselves

762
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,140
because these are familiar tasks for us

763
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,880
if you've been involved in incident

764
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,399
response probably a lot of the tests

765
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,380
that you do seem very familiar and very

766
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,140
routine to you the challenge that we

767
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,240
have during incident response when we

768
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,240
look company-wide is that not all of the

769
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,279
other stakeholders that engage with us

770
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,020
on those issues

771
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,620
are as familiar with not just our tasks

772
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,440
but their tasks they may again if

773
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,240
they're only talking about security when

774
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,760
they have to they're maybe talking about

775
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,820
it a couple times a year if that right

776
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,620
which means every time they're doing it

777
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,840
it's actually a new task for them they

778
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,299
have not developed the muscle memory or

779
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:53,399
the cognitive memory to be able to make

780
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:56,820
these rote tasks for them and so every

781
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,640
incident is using up a huge percentage

782
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,500
of their cognitive capacity

783
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,500
and so the more familiar a task or skill

784
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,220
becomes the less capacity it requires so

785
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,620
I want incident response to be something

786
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,799
that my Executives can do in their sleep

787
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,200
because if they don't do it often enough

788
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,860
then every time they do have to do it

789
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,600
it's like they're learning something new

790
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,419
all over again and they're not going to

791
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:29,820
have the capacity they need to make

792
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,500
those good decisions and to practice

793
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,340
sound judgment

794
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,679
and so how do we actually do this right

795
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,899
how do we actually get the executives to

796
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:41,940
focus on the right thing not like the

797
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,140
shiny object we assign tasks to them we

798
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,140
get them to agree to those tasks and we

799
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,559
practice like crazy all the time

800
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,419
so how many of you are familiar with the

801
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:55,559
racing model

802
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,960
okay perfect this is not something I

803
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,640
invented want to make that very clear

804
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,100
this is very popular in you know

805
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,559
business management and other types of

806
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,299
project management situations

807
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:08,280
essentially for those of you who are

808
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,719
familiar

809
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:13,500
um for each task you have a party or

810
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,020
team or perhaps a function within a

811
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,359
company who is responsible for that task

812
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:20,699
they initiate it and it is their job to

813
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,099
see it through to completion there is an

814
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,719
accountable party these are the people

815
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,359
who have to sign off they may not start

816
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,460
it but they have to give the okay before

817
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,280
it can be completed so in the case of

818
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,500
incident response maybe it's

819
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,540
um the pr team starts the public

820
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,060
statement but the legal team has to sign

821
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,599
off on it before it's actually sent out

822
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,918
externally from the company

823
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,760
uh third there is consulted parties

824
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,040
and there are informed parties

825
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,480
consultant parties are the folks that

826
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,580
may have to contribute so again if we go

827
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,199
back to that example of a public

828
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,420
statement about a data breach

829
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,580
I certainly hope although this is not

830
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,020
always true but I would certainly hope

831
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,640
that your security team has some input

832
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,619
on what is that publicly just to make

833
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:05,700
sure that I don't know it's actually

834
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,140
true

835
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,119
and then the informed parties are the

836
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,579
folks who make it the FYI or the memo or

837
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,260
you need to have visibility that this is

838
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,940
happening because you've got other tasks

839
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,640
going on you need to be aligned it's

840
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,220
really important to get

841
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,440
um buy-in and approval from the

842
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,680
stakeholders for these assignments

843
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,859
before an incident happens

844
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:31,200
um number one because they're not yet

845
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,260
panicked and so they are it is just a

846
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,880
far better conversation about who's

847
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,400
responsible for what uh when people are

848
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,160
not panicked and freaking out right

849
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,740
and number two because it is so helpful

850
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,900
to be able to show them all of the

851
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,640
things that need to happen in incident

852
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,960
response

853
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,560
that they don't want to be part of right

854
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,000
when

855
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,520
um I've done tabletop exercises with

856
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,260
companies when I ask who's responsible

857
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,260
for customer Communications I want four

858
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,599
different people raise the hand no no

859
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,880
you can't have four people responsible

860
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,440
for something you're either going to

861
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,119
duplicate your work or it's not going to

862
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,880
get done right we pick one person who's

863
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,500
responsible and everybody else who

864
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,119
thinks they need to have an opinion on

865
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,880
that thing can be a consulted party

866
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,339
right

867
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:23,220
but what I have found is that when we go

868
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,960
through the whole list of all these

869
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,780
things some of these auxiliary functions

870
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,540
like HR or like oh God please don't

871
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,220
include me in that unless you absolutely

872
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,020
have to because there's a list of 20

873
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,520
things and we only have two people on

874
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,660
our team

875
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,660
perfect fewer stakeholders we can go

876
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,599
faster right so it's really helpful to

877
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,880
actually help the executives visualize

878
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,640
everything that needs to happen

879
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,280
um because it forces them to select the

880
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,020
small number of things that they

881
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,119
actually want to be part of that we need

882
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:56,460
them to be part of

883
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,520
so obviously my focus is in

884
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,200
communication so when I do this with

885
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,359
clients the four areas that we focus on

886
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,420
most often are Communications that

887
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,160
happen during the investigation who's

888
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,359
going to be part of the communications

889
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,280
if we need to reach out to the AWS

890
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,500
security team or the GitHub security

891
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,720
team who's who's in charge of those

892
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,520
Communications any communication that is

893
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,460
leaving our environment is up for grabs

894
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,320
when it comes to you know potentially

895
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,420
making its way to the public but also

896
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,760
impacting our relationships with really

897
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,680
important Partners who could help us get

898
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,060
the answers that we need for an

899
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,260
investigation

900
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,480
second we're looking at notification

901
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,460
communication this is where we work most

902
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,339
closely with our legal colleagues to

903
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,440
make sure that we are meeting the

904
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,020
regulatory requirements but also so that

905
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,720
we make sure notifications don't suck

906
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,420
right nobody wants to get a notification

907
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,339
that sounds like my lawyer wrote it

908
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:51,250
nobody

909
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,280
[Music]

910
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,380
we also look at corporate Communications

911
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,599
this is where the the pr team usually

912
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,040
comes into play or the marketing team

913
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,839
whoever is responsible for that function

914
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:03,000
and then finally we will look at

915
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,810
customer support Communications

916
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:05,520
[Music]

917
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,119
um

918
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,160
you know who who's going to reach out to

919
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,440
the customers not just if they need to

920
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,880
be notified but just to let them know

921
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,680
that we're looking into something right

922
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,780
for example if we go back to the the

923
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,820
OCTA example

924
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,339
um when somebody needs to tell the

925
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,839
customers that we're at least aware of

926
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,700
what's happening and you know we're not

927
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,260
like sitting on our thumbs we're looking

928
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,260
to to investigate our own environment

929
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,240
um so those are the four typical

930
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,460
categories that we look at and we will

931
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,380
list out all of the communication tasks

932
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,300
that need to happen in those buckets and

933
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,740
make sure that every single one of them

934
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,260
has a responsible party an accountable

935
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,480
party that we're Consulting the right

936
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,180
people and that the people who just need

937
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,040
to know but don't need to slow us down

938
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,740
they can get the FYI memo and then we

939
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,119
can talk about you know what is the

940
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,980
frequency of those Communications right

941
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,300
can I send it to you at the end of the

942
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,920
day rather than every minute because my

943
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,240
security team actually needs to be

944
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,379
focused on remediation

945
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,980
and so practice practice the more we can

946
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,619
use our incident response plans the

947
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:10,200
better we will be at executing them and

948
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,700
more importantly the better our

949
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,560
stakeholders and our Executives will be

950
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,980
executing their parts right so these are

951
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,119
just kind of

952
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,160
um some example categories that I talk

953
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,060
about

954
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,339
um a lot in our client work where you

955
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:24,900
know everybody kind of looks at that Top

956
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,579
Line where it's like the intrusion the

957
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:28,140
data like the big things that you read

958
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,700
in the headlines right

959
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,000
I want my security teams to be using our

960
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,160
incident response plan on everything

961
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,560
right there's a product vulnerability

962
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,359
follow the plan

963
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,700
right you don't have to go through every

964
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,859
level of escalation particularly if it's

965
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:46,980
a minor incident but we need to get our

966
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,380
stakeholders

967
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,660
normalized and familiar with all of the

968
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,940
different types of incidents that happen

969
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,180
so that they can use this plan over and

970
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,000
over and over again so that they are in

971
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,280
Tip-Top shape for when it matters the

972
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,640
most right so if your plan is too

973
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,119
cumbersome to be used on a daily basis

974
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,060
with these you know routine incidents

975
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,540
that we all have all the time it's not

976
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,000
it's probably not the right plan and

977
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,920
you're only going to be using it in

978
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,780
those big moments where again your

979
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,240
stakeholders are unfamiliar with this

980
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,460
task every time they're encountered with

981
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,980
it and they're not at you know the

982
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,800
optimal cognitive position to be able to

983
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,359
make the right kinds of decisions that

984
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,119
we hope that they would

985
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,400
and do a couple of closing thoughts

986
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,339
before I end

987
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,619
um just a couple of Boss mode tips for

988
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:46,680
folks I highly recommend that you commit

989
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,740
up front with your executive team that

990
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,839
you will use every incident to

991
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,780
strengthen your reputation I look at

992
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:59,040
security incidents as opportunities when

993
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,320
else is the entire world willing to

994
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,240
listen to you

995
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:08,220
that to talk about security use that to

996
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,660
point to the things that you have been

997
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,660
investing in that you have been building

998
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,280
and if you have been doing all of the

999
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,020
other things that we talked about in

1000
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,960
terms of creating content engaging in

1001
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,300
community discussions you will actually

1002
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,160
have a history of contact information

1003
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,579
that you can point back to right build a

1004
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:31,859
library of credible content for yourself

1005
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,320
second is that it's really not a crisis

1006
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,079
until you make it one how you respond to

1007
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:40,079
the incident matters a lot more than the

1008
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,180
incident itself from your executive's

1009
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,980
perspective your executives are

1010
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,540
concerned about financial loss

1011
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,520
reputation loss and Regulatory

1012
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,619
investigations right how you respond to

1013
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,540
the incident is what impacts those

1014
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,980
things

1015
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,240
and lastly take care of your IR team

1016
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,000
one of the things that is most that I

1017
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,920
have found most satisfactory doing this

1018
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,040
work is knowing that the less panicked

1019
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,900
the executives are the less pressure

1020
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,960
there is on the IRT I can take better

1021
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,180
care of ir teams and their mental health

1022
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,579
and their well-being if I don't have

1023
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,500
trigger happy Executives breathing down

1024
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,859
their neck

1025
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,460
yes so when you're talking about

1026
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,640
practice uh do tabletop exercises help

1027
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,440
with that can that kind of help people

1028
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,079
get into that practice mode yeah I think

1029
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:39,720
I recommend tabletop exercises as a

1030
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,520
really good introduction especially for

1031
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,780
stakeholders who have never been

1032
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,700
involved in incidents before or have

1033
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,440
never been involved in incidents at your

1034
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,300
particular organization right when you

1035
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,099
introduce them to like here's the new

1036
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:51,960
process or here's the updated process

1037
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,760
right I think it's important to have

1038
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,040
those on a regular basis whether it's

1039
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,020
you know biannually or quarterly or

1040
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,060
whatever or it's your organization but

1041
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,619
again you can imagine I mean you know

1042
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:04,200
how many the resources it takes to pull

1043
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,520
together something like that you can't

1044
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,859
do that every Tuesday right right but

1045
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:09,119
every Tuesday there's something

1046
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,800
happening on your security team that

1047
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,440
they're investigating right follow your

1048
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,420
plan at least you know to the point of

1049
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,760
escalation where it makes sense for that

1050
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,940
particular scenario right so that by the

1051
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,680
time something really big happens your

1052
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,300
executive should be able to do stuff in

1053
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,280
one three three with their eyes closed

1054
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,000
any other questions

1055
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,280
if you're ever in Tulum and you want to

1056
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,140
go skuba diving let me know

1057
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,920
