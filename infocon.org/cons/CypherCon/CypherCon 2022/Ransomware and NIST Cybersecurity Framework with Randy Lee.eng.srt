00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,399
[Music]

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,700
thank you

3
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:29,238
[Music]

4
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,218
all right

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,460
foreign

6
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,719
okay why don't we go and get started

7
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,240
so if you're in the ransomware and the

8
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,340
niche cyber security framework you're in

9
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,439
the right session

10
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,820
there's a lot going on today I want to

11
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,500
make sure I confirm that

12
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,380
uh real quick I want to introduce myself

13
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm Randy Lee

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,840
uh in my past life I manage I.T I had a

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,040
number of organizations so Financial

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,320
Services Health Care I've been in the

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,900
mid-level I.T management and for those

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,580
that are still that are in middle level

19
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,020
it management

20
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,659
my heart goes out to you

21
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,520
because you have a lot of responsibility

22
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,220
but not not always empowered to make

23
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,420
those changes and we're going to talk

24
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,860
about some of the stuff that you can use

25
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,060
today

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,280
bring back your leadership team things

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,960
that we're seeing in the field

28
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,540
currently I'm a systems engineer at

29
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,079
veeam an evening customers

30
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,939
excellent I like seeing that so I spent

31
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,140
a lot of my time talking about data

32
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,040
protection

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,640
and we're if you look at V right as

34
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,960
employees we're all trying to change

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,460
that perception of backup as being

36
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,659
something you have to do to something

37
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,640
that you need to do it's really part of

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,098
your overall defensive strategy when it

39
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,800
comes to cyber security attacks so I

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,099
live locally if you're a game customer

41
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,200
please help to see me later right we

42
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,520
could talk about things that we can do

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,860
right health checks or other other

44
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,080
elements right of your environment I

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,580
live in Wauwatosa I Come From The Far

46
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,980
Far off land of Wauwatosa

47
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,119
anyone okay

48
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,040
so a couple topics we'll talk about we

49
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,540
only have 30 minutes there's a lot this

50
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,459
could be a multi

51
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,800
-day right or certainly multi-hour

52
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,959
session uh I'm just gonna give you some

53
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,379
introductory Concepts to nist a little

54
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,180
more about ransomware what we're seeing

55
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,459
by the way I have Joe Martin in the back

56
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,200
he'll happily field your questions as

57
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,680
well he's my manager at V thank you Joe

58
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,780
some ransomware headlines we all know

59
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,120
we've all seen them you know even you

60
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,980
know my kid was 10 years old he was

61
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,480
asking me what's ransomware all right we

62
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,760
all know it's out there we're seeing it

63
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,220
everywhere mainstream right I don't I'm

64
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,140
nothing with all the headlines but I'm

65
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,360
on ransomware alerts every day I see

66
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,000
them and every day I'm scared because

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,099
they're getting worse some of the

68
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,019
ransomware and mitigation costs and

69
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,879
these are some that I pulled together I

70
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,379
quite honestly these are probably

71
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,000
obsolete now

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,819
right we're seeing more and more attacks

73
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,280
more and more sophisticated attacks and

74
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,379
more and more financial implication or

75
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,420
or

76
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,400
Consequences right of those attacks

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,200
so let's talk a little about ransomware

78
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,220
is

79
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,040
right we've heard about it

80
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,260
what does it really mean right what are

81
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,560
what are we seeing a lot of so uh first

82
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,340
of all

83
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,040
there's a couple different types but by

84
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,360
the way I like to use one simple word

85
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,239
with ransomware it's extortion

86
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,640
someone is taking your data and selling

87
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,739
it to someone else someone is taking

88
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,980
your data not allowing you access to it

89
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,900
someone is not letting you into your

90
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,819
assistance if that doesn't qualify as

91
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,140
extortion

92
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,500
I don't know what does so really

93
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,940
when you're having conversations with

94
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,439
your leadership team with other people

95
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,140
with your security people consider using

96
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,599
that word right we are at risk for

97
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,699
extortion what do you mean ransomware oh

98
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,180
okay right

99
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,460
uh the the amount of rents were received

100
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,100
right this grows

101
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,699
there's a statistic that you know 51 of

102
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,320
people pay that Ransom that is scary

103
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,900
please don't pay the ransom there's a

104
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,100
couple different types that we really

105
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,720
talk about there's other variations so

106
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,639
we saw some of the the exploits before

107
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,600
but uh The lockerwear Ransom or

108
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,400
ransomware rather someone's taking your

109
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,419
keys

110
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,580
they got in your system they created

111
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,440
their own accounts they lock your

112
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,560
accounts out they trained credentials

113
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,979
and to get those back you need to pay

114
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,259
the ransom or take some other action by

115
00:04:58,259 --> 00:04:59,580
the way there's a number of ways to help

116
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,639
with that Locker where ransomware I'm

117
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,060
seeing more often crypto wear ransomware

118
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,820
someone gets into your system

119
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,520
takes control of your data right they

120
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,919
encrypt your data they do something to

121
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,199
prevent you from having access to it

122
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,419
a little different than stealing it and

123
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,280
we'll talk about stages momentarily but

124
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,520
but it's happening every week

125
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,199
actually several times a week I'm gonna

126
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,660
call someone that is scared about or

127
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,880
concerned about it or was hit and and

128
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,460
we're only hearing a portion a lot of

129
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,520
people try to not talk about it please

130
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,620
don't hide those situations because they

131
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,759
only make it worse than someone else

132
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,360
so I also want to talk about uh Island

133
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,060
yes island hopping right it's a World

134
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,979
War II term where where we didn't just

135
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,919
go to you know our and Target we Island

136
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,759
hopped to get there supply chain right

137
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,780
if you yourself are very secure if you

138
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,639
give yourself a taken action there's

139
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,620
nothing to say that someone Downstream

140
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,720
from you right someone you work with

141
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,660
someone you have as a trusted partner

142
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,580
doesn't have an impact and you gave them

143
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,400
access to your victim

144
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,680
I was once asked I was at I.T director I

145
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,840
was asked by law enforcement

146
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,240
uh if I was concerned about someone's

147
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,819
ability to access the network I said No

148
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,220
I gave them full access

149
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,900
they had a warrant for their arrests

150
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,940
yeah this was someone else's issue but I

151
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,440
just given them access to the kingdom

152
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,759
right so we we trusted

153
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,440
another organization

154
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,600
and we should have uh I have the

155
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,580
aquarium in the corner

156
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,020
you guys hear what the fish tank isn't

157
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,580
in Las Vegas

158
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,639
yeah perfect example I'll just go and

159
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,319
add this device

160
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,639
by the way how many people have secure

161
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,440
networks at home

162
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,620
with devices excellent I knew this would

163
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,600
be the crowd to raise their hands on

164
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,979
that one I have isolated that works with

165
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,780
my iot devices

166
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm too concerned what my rain doorbell

167
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,520
or my Nest security cam right they're

168
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,900
separate from everything else and I had

169
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,979
to be able to turn them on and turn them

170
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,780
off

171
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,120
uh ransomware examples these are some

172
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,620
that I came up with

173
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,020
uh the ones in in bold

174
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,180
are the ones I'm seeing or have seen

175
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,560
locally but uh Bryant uh Rebel had a

176
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,740
really bad netwalker attack in Illinois

177
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,319
maybe six months ago and throw a little

178
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,960
endorsement for my employer they're able

179
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,440
to recover with the in their situation

180
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,699
everything was taken out their veeam

181
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,680
servers are really across the board but

182
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,060
they had a mutable backups and we'll

183
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,979
come back to that topic they're able to

184
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:43,740
reinstall veeam and do restores and as a

185
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,240
result of that water it's like but by

186
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,979
the way the ransomware request 2.1

187
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,680
million dollars that day

188
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,900
the request dropped at 400 000 as a

189
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,280
service resource then they paid nothing

190
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,259
like those are the fun stories

191
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,720
so I'm seeing a bad rabbit I'm seeing

192
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,699
crypto Locker there's others on here as

193
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:00,960
well but these are the ones that kind of

194
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,780
pop into my mind as uh as let's put the

195
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,460
stack together

196
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,099
top entry points

197
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,039
the big one right email

198
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,500
uh I got an email from my CEO once he

199
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,880
asked me to click on something for some

200
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,039
report no no I'm not going to be doing

201
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,840
that I don't even trust emails for my

202
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,020
boss

203
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,660
yeah

204
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,460
um leveraging vulnerabilities we talked

205
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,199
about vulnerabilities they're everywhere

206
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,000
they continue to get worse we find more

207
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,319
and more

208
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,299
what's uh what's the how many patches

209
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,059
did Microsoft release last month

210
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,820
it was quite a few

211
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,458
so they're out there remote desktop

212
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,380
protocol hey welcome to covid let's give

213
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,860
our own RDP and hope for the best

214
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,200
we're seeing entry points there that are

215
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,320
are scary uh drive-by attacks they click

216
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,880
on this website and while you're there

217
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,160
click on this link whoops that's a

218
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,540
perfect example of the drive-by attack

219
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,160
we're seeing a lot of that

220
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,279
and then USB devices

221
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,060
um

222
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,820
please be careful of those

223
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,580
and also I had a QR code up earlier let

224
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,140
me scan that

225
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,760
okay

226
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,940
you should know

227
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,560
no I'm not kidding this is actually a

228
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,380
bean phone

229
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,300
good answer

230
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,140
by the way there's something on the

231
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,180
bottom here

232
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,459
it's a weird trick now I it's not my

233
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,740
trick it's something I read and some of

234
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,000
you are nodding like you may have heard

235
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,440
about this before

236
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,080
if you are in the Russian Federation and

237
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,820
you attack others

238
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,800
outside the Russian Federation they

239
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,120
don't care

240
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,800
if you're the Russian Federation and you

241
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,880
attack someone within the Russian

242
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,680
Federation they will find you

243
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,100
why not put a Russian keyboard set

244
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,959
virtual on your system somewhere so that

245
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,700
when they scan

246
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,920
that software automatically stops

247
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,899
running and removes itself I have no

248
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,820
idea if this works no one's ever told me

249
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,920
yep it worked because there's no real

250
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,420
way of knowing

251
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,760
something happened and went away no one

252
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,279
was was wiser consider that there's a

253
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,839
link to it I'll make sure you have

254
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,420
access to that link as well

255
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,260
uh ransomware stages

256
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,240
different things different people right

257
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,540
stage zero is someone found a hole a

258
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,760
hole right a vulnerability into your

259
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,920
environment we all have them we don't

260
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,839
know where they are we try to plug them

261
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,580
we try to stop them but they're out

262
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,140
there somewhere

263
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,300
right that we all have them

264
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,019
stage one the Bad actors have access to

265
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,180
an individual system or multiple systems

266
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,320
are limited maybe they took over

267
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,760
someone's notebook

268
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,800
someone's you know individual file

269
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,080
server right very limited in scope we're

270
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,760
still not concerned it's not a good

271
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,720
thing

272
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,360
but it's relatively isolated

273
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,220
right now we start getting into stage

274
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,800
two they have access to data and they're

275
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,839
able to take that data

276
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:55,800
all right

277
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,200
uh 14 percent

278
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,240
uh firms indicate that the time between

279
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,579
compromise and detection is up to six

280
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,140
months so someone making your system now

281
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,120
you don't know it they may be pulling

282
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,220
down data selling the data displaying

283
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,899
that data you know who knows now we

284
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,339
start getting into the stereo once and

285
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,200
we're at stage three

286
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,660
where they have right access this is

287
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,060
where the actual encryption happens had

288
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,640
a customer call me he said this on a

289
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,680
Monday he called me said on Saturday I

290
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,600
got a call that things were weird at

291
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,519
work

292
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,140
like what does that mean he goes I don't

293
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,000
know either so I drove in yeah things

294
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,399
were weird files were disappearing I

295
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,660
looked at my server I saw someone

296
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,339
encrypting my data

297
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,500
okay that's weird what'd you do I unplug

298
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,660
the Nick right away

299
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,279
so he hadn't took immediate action we're

300
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,240
gonna come back to that there's a

301
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,440
question I have later to ask you but

302
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,120
that's where we start seeing an impact

303
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,640
that's where you know the beam where I

304
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,380
work right we are not a cyber security

305
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,720
company specifically but we are part of

306
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,060
your cyber security strategy right there

307
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,760
isn't an ability to recover and we have

308
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,260
methods of recovery we'll cover some of

309
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,120
those and then stage four this is where

310
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,339
it gets really scary they introduced new

311
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,220
hooks into your system right creating

312
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,720
new accounts

313
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,100
we'll talk about some of the ways to

314
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,720
help with something stages speaking of

315
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,200
Bad actors

316
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,839
had to throw that in

317
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,480
all right so cyber security versus cyber

318
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,519
security Frameworks I think we all

319
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,620
practice good cyber security

320
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,839
at least we try to right I passed my

321
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,459
desktops at home I have my kids pass

322
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,500
their devices

323
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,480
we're all doing something that we think

324
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,279
is good

325
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,480
practicing good cyber security

326
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,820
principles is a good thing

327
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,339
is not as good as having an active cyber

328
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:39,899
security framework

329
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,300
again what do you mean by framework I

330
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,880
have guidelines I have standards anyone

331
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,279
up cisps

332
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,260
excellent okay so you know about some of

333
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,360
these cyber security Frameworks but it's

334
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,339
about best practices and it's continuous

335
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,200
I like to remind people of the concept

336
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,720
of do care versus due diligence if you

337
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,940
took your cissp exam you probably saw

338
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,240
that due care is trying to do the right

339
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,579
thing at the moment due diligence do

340
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,980
diligence is doing the right thing all

341
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,779
the time and then doing it again next

342
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,240
week and the week after that and keeping

343
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,500
that that process up

344
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,060
[Music]

345
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,700
there's a number of Frameworks

346
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,279
some of them cost money some of them are

347
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,620
better than others the one I really

348
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,420
personally like is the nist cyber

349
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,680
security framework

350
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,540
and again

351
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,639
what's your favorite version of Linux

352
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,839
right

353
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,100
same kind of thing here what's your

354
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,959
favorite cyberspic framework I like this

355
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,240
one because they're it's it's very

356
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,519
thorough it's very complete

357
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,079
they cover a lot and I'm just going to

358
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,399
show you some samples we only have you

359
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,620
know 30 minutes here

360
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,480
um you know first of all what is nist

361
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,339
right it's a non-regulatory agency uh it

362
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:51,420
used to be the National Bureau of

363
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,740
Standards right if you go back some

364
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,720
years and it's part of the Department of

365
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,519
Commerce right the non-reculatory agency

366
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,079
is a big part of this right they're not

367
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,540
here to enforce rules they're here to

368
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,120
give you um give you help

369
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,980
right and it's all about providing you

370
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,480
resources they're always updating their

371
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,459
stuff we're trying to I think the latest

372
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,620
version we're in a one dot something

373
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,760
version

374
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,360
uh the the uh version 1.01 so it's a

375
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,680
collection of Standards guidelines and

376
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,220
best practices to manage cyber security

377
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,540
talk to a lot of customers we don't know

378
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,620
where to start with cyber security we

379
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,880
know we're concerned about it we've

380
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,139
heard about it

381
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,820
we know other people are being hit our

382
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,860
competitors were just hit I got a call

383
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,959
on a Saturday uh morning once I'm a CIO

384
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,579
hey can you talk to us about cyber

385
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:33,779
security I said sure thing you know

386
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,399
Monday morning 10 a.m because can we do

387
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,139
it earlier okay what's going on right

388
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,300
some of their competitors were hit they

389
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,399
knew they needed some immediate action

390
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,560
but they don't know where to start

391
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,180
they they knew there's policies out

392
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,220
there let me talk about this right I'm

393
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,180
not going to deal with all your new

394
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,920
stuff for you but let me introduce you

395
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,180
to the concept

396
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,920
extremely extremely uh comprehensive

397
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,480
and there is some federal enforcement

398
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,760
right if you go back to executive order

399
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,040
13636

400
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,860
it's about nist right presidential order

401
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,720
get your standards up there's a bunch of

402
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,560
links out here too

403
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,740
what is the cyber security framework I

404
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,540
can't go into all that right in 30

405
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,279
minutes I do want to introduce you to

406
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,420
the concept basically it's about

407
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,820
identifying

408
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,480
protecting

409
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,959
detecting responding and recovering

410
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,540
in that order yes but it's continuous

411
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,639
right you may get different stages

412
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,579
within different systems

413
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,860
and you're always you should always be

414
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,660
doing it there's no real no idle time

415
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,060
for it now ideally you can automate some

416
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,000
of these processes get your executive

417
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,500
leadership involved

418
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,600
right what's the one thing executive

419
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,880
leadership likes to do about it making

420
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,100
someone else's problem

421
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,279
privacy protection of this data that is

422
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,440
all a C Level right or board of

423
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,360
directors conversation

424
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,880
and and you bring the tools we are as

425
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,279
I.T people as technology people we are

426
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,019
custodians

427
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,880
we are not the owners of data we own

428
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,320
some of our own data but the reality is

429
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,180
we're kind of we're kind of like law

430
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,320
enforcement

431
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,120
right we we make sure and apply the

432
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,220
appropriate controls limitations called

433
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,199
security call what you want

434
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,899
there's a lot to this slide but again it

435
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,079
focuses on I identify protect

436
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,959
uh detect respond

437
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,839
and recover most of my time is is spent

438
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,459
a little bit of a lot of protection

439
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:30,839
hopefully up around we're doing some

440
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,500
protection uh some detection a lot of

441
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,120
recovery there's a number of ways we can

442
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,740
recover a lot of the customers here if

443
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,300
you have questions on how to reduce the

444
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,100
recovery well not your game customer

445
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,139
doesn't matter happy to help have to

446
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:45,300
show you some some things that we've

447
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,339
seen success with some areas where we've

448
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,339
not seen some success let's break this

449
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,199
down a little bit further okay there's a

450
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:54,240
lot in this eye chart

451
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,680
we'll make sure you get a copy otherwise

452
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,199
just go to the next site then it breaks

453
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,560
down those sections uh one key element

454
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,319
identifying your assets

455
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,880
I remember a specifically had a

456
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,859
situation where I remember this like it

457
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,059
was yesterday

458
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,040
uh someone built a server and brought it

459
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,780
into our office and plugged it in and

460
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,459
then uh opened up a hires and tickets

461
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,439
when it didn't work right shame on us

462
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,179
for not knowing it was there we let them

463
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,919
do that we're unaware they did that

464
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,260
that's part of our identification

465
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,880
we should have been

466
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,919
you know very clearly aware that it was

467
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,480
there shame on them for not involving

468
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,559
I.T

469
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,700
but all the the protection we had in

470
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,100
mind all the the placeholders we had to

471
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,360
keep track of all the stuff were out the

472
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,039
window at that point because they uh

473
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,419
went around I.T

474
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:40,559
I'm not going to go through all these

475
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,539
specifics but I highly encourage you to

476
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:43,799
look at that in this cyber security

477
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,360
framework

478
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,980
and bring this back to your leadership

479
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,380
teams get them involved this is not an

480
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,120
I.T issue by the way I can't tell you

481
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,740
many times

482
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,980
that as a vmsc customers ask me what

483
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,660
their data retention requirements should

484
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,860
be

485
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,520
I don't know

486
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,020
I can give you some ideas

487
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,480
but I don't think even you should answer

488
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,220
that question the zit director that is

489
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,480
something that comes out of legal so

490
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,280
back to my Healthcare days I went to my

491
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,780
health care or my legal team My

492
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,980
Healthcare Department

493
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,080
emphasis on legal and I said what are

494
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,640
data retention requirements their answer

495
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,780
was just an I.T issue

496
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,160
it is you should be barking at me you

497
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,360
should be chewing me out right now

498
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,799
because I don't have this up to your

499
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,720
standards well we don't have standards

500
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,039
yeah that's the problem you need to tell

501
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,179
me what we're doing otherwise I'm going

502
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:31,620
to back up three days

503
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,760
and that's it

504
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,539
and by the way it's your issue not mine

505
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,340
it wasn't quite so adversarial when I

506
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,660
brought this up with them but you

507
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,240
understand the point so identify right

508
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,860
develop an organizational understanding

509
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,200
to manage cyber security

510
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,419
it's a cultural

511
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,980
you know we all go through the cyber

512
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,860
security training it's not a lot of fun

513
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,480
users don't like having to do it it is

514
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,580
extremely essential you know every time

515
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,340
I take one I learn something

516
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,260
and if I'm learning something in my role

517
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,940
where I do this all the time you should

518
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,539
be learning a lot

519
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,280
protect

520
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,200
and I'll show you a couple slides to

521
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,900
talk about protection so as a recovery

522
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,780
company as a data protection company uh

523
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,140
as someone that helps you

524
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,700
restore data when necessary this is a

525
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,820
key element of what we do

526
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,220
uh there's a couple rules or a couple

527
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,260
guidelines right our own best practices

528
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,760
but there are industry standard that I

529
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,960
like to talk about first of all is the

530
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,059
three two one rule I'm expanding that a

531
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,340
little bit three copies of your data on

532
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,900
at least two different devices with one

533
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,580
off site

534
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,179
so maybe I have uh my Milwaukee my

535
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,860
location I have a couple I have a

536
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,900
primary array I have a backup array and

537
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,360
then I send my data to some other City

538
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,340
to Madison right three copies two

539
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,919
different devices with one off site we

540
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:54,840
like to make sure we test those backups

541
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,760
we have ways to do within veeam there

542
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,140
are other applications that do that as

543
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,640
well by all means if you have the test

544
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,200
of your backups assume they don't work

545
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,780
and I need a full a full test

546
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,460
and there's a lot of threats to that I

547
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,039
can I can show you a couple well zero

548
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,419
but also one of those kinds of being

549
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:10,500
immutable we'll come back to that

550
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,720
momentarily management Zone if you want

551
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,280
an easy thing to do take all your

552
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,840
recovery systems put it in a completely

553
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,740
separate environment whatever

554
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,179
credentials I log into my production

555
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:19,860
environment with I use different

556
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,320
credentials for my recovery environment

557
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,640
it makes it a little more difficult to

558
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,260
manage but I guarantee you you'll be

559
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,299
happy in the end the easy thing to do

560
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,340
and if you're a vegan customer

561
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,679
it's you know minister to that

562
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,380
leverage immutability we just had a

563
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,640
conversation in the hallway with someone

564
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,820
that made their data immutable

565
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,919
and by that I mean locking so will not

566
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,500
be modified or changed right I write my

567
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,419
data 7 mutability for 90 days cannot be

568
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,460
deleted they had the CEO of that

569
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,260
organization called the CEO the cloud

570
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,820
provider or the organization say please

571
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,860
delete our data and they refuse to do it

572
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,500
good for them it's immutable the number

573
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,140
one target for like net Walker attacks

574
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,880
is your recovery systems they go after

575
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,320
your recovery systems first because the

576
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,640
oil recovery systems they have a lot

577
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,600
more leverage

578
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,179
so use immutability that could be on

579
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:07,559
premise well I have another slide tool

580
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,419
we'll come back to that

581
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:11,160
uh encryption

582
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,020
if you haven't encrypted your data in

583
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,780
the cloud someone else will

584
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,600
so please be careful about that

585
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,640
and don't lose your encryption keys I

586
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,679
can't find them for you

587
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,299
thank you for asking

588
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,679
so three copies of the data two

589
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,539
universes at least one off site test

590
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:29,580
your backups and make sure there's no

591
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,020
errors let's talk a little bit about

592
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,880
immutability and I kind of hit on it

593
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,880
already I see cloud-based immutability I

594
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,559
write my data to a cloud provider I ask

595
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,880
the cloud provider to make sure that

596
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,100
data cannot be deleted for a certain

597
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,600
period of time I've had security people

598
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,520
call me up can you we want to change our

599
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,679
usability policy can you help no you got

600
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,179
to wait until the boss expires and then

601
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,580
you know redo it which is a good thing

602
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,679
that's working by Design I have a number

603
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,000
of customers putting in their own

604
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,520
immutable targets what's the best way to

605
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,480
secure a Windows server

606
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,600
yes or replace it

607
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,640
with Linux

608
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,740
by the way true story my kid wanted he

609
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,740
was 11 years old what a PC in his room I

610
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,120
said not a problem but it's got to run

611
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,559
Linux

612
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,960
what you need to know this

613
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,880
right you wanted the boots by the way

614
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,039
for those playing the home game uh

615
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,360
there's a lot of reasons to do that so

616
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,120
object storage object immutability based

617
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,919
on your own cloud or based on your own

618
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,179
platform

619
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,940
so make sure that's protected backups

620
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,320
are not archives archives are not

621
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,780
backups and please snapshots are not

622
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,280
backups

623
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,780
they're all part of your strategy

624
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,600
snapshots perfect use

625
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,000
well use use snapshots but don't assume

626
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,620
that they're going to help you in

627
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,320
long-term situations we utilize SV we

628
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,580
utilize snapshots as part of our

629
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,080
production strategy we'll take a

630
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,179
snapshots on the array do the do a

631
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:52,679
backup and then put them in archive a

632
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:54,780
backup is something is broken I need to

633
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,159
get it back

634
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,960
I had a customer who's Dr plant and I

635
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,460
completely understand the logic the our

636
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,320
plan was to recover from the cloud did

637
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,960
100 terabytes of data

638
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,880
it's going to take a few weeks right so

639
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,520
have an on-premise as well

640
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,840
um yeah

641
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,700
and then detect

642
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,500
there's a number of things to detect

643
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,940
I'll give you a couple little patterns

644
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,860
to look for and again this is all about

645
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,880
data recovery if you see a high write

646
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,559
rate and high read rate and high

647
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,900
processors something's going on

648
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,340
someone could be reading your data

649
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,780
encrypting that data and then writing

650
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,480
that data somewhere else

651
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,179
you know huge red flag maybe it's normal

652
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,679
but make sure you look at another

653
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,140
another big one is uh hey my duplication

654
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,419
ratios went down to zero yeah

655
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,520
something's going on

656
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,080
those are flags remember we said the

657
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,400
dwell time

658
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,140
these help solve that dwell time

659
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,179
hopefully with all that dwell time

660
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:49,740
they're waiting three or four months to

661
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,360
do an actual attack but in the meantime

662
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,620
they've encrypt your data or done

663
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,120
something right these are indicators

664
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,100
that you may want to take some action

665
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,919
and then respond

666
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:00,659
recover right these are all elements

667
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,700
that that we could get into by the way

668
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,080
what's the difference between a Dr plan

669
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,639
and a ransomware recovery plan

670
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,460
one maybe you lost Hardware right but

671
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,200
the other you lost data you should have

672
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,140
the same level of attention in a lot of

673
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,539
the same hooks right into your data

674
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:19,740
recovery plan with a ransomware attack

675
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,120
as you do with Dr

676
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:25,559
uh by the way please please don't hide

677
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,419
something if something happens please

678
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:28,760
report it

679
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,380
ic3 they're very willing to help great

680
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,299
organization something happens please

681
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:34,260
tell them

682
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,059
I've had organizations that kind of just

683
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,500
don't really want to let people know I

684
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,480
completely get it it just makes the

685
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,220
situation worse and they're they're here

686
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,059
to help

687
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,039
and don't pay the ransom by the way

688
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:47,580
what's a vulnerability a threat and a

689
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,059
risk right well of vulnerabilities

690
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,100
we connect to the internet right we have

691
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,140
email there's all vulnerabilities you

692
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,580
know threats something is actually

693
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,260
happening someone's trying to go after

694
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,380
you right so my vulnerabilities plus my

695
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,179
threats there's my risk

696
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:04,740
right it's a combination of those

697
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,059
elements we know we can't avoid

698
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:08,039
vulnerabilities we can reduce them we

699
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,539
know we can't avoid threats we can

700
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,400
reduce them but if you combine those

701
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,320
together the amount of vulnerabilities I

702
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,299
have plus the the threats that I have

703
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:18,059
that equals my total risk couple or

704
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,559
three questions I want to leave here

705
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,280
with

706
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,380
do you have authorization to take action

707
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,679
in the event of a cyber security events

708
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,440
that's huge uh something was happening

709
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,480
uh I don't know I better call Bob no

710
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,940
kick ass and do something

711
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,860
have a pre-op be able to take that

712
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,080
action up front uh do you have an

713
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,260
instant response plan not in your head

714
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,240
in writing if you want a template I can

715
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,400
help you you look them up on Google or I

716
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,140
can send you some good ones

717
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,880
and then have you ever done tabletop

718
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,539
exercises

719
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,919
walk in hey we have a wire I see this

720
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,539
happening what should we do you know you

721
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,820
know everyone braced on uh by the way

722
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,260
if you're interested in doing tabletop

723
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,760
exercises we're going to be doing some

724
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,980
some customer tabletop exercises in the

725
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,900
next few months where we throw scenarios

726
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,720
out and see how people react uh you will

727
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,460
learn a lot I will learn a lot we'll all

728
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,080
learn a lot from each other

729
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,900
so tabletop exercises are very important

730
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,220
but I had a customer employment the

731
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,900
table that exercises and then the next

732
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,279
week they're able to ransomware and I

733
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,419
thought it was another table that says

734
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:21,779
no this is legit you gotta go so that's

735
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,400
um all that I got any questions on Ben
