27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,100
right

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,899
right before they shut everything down

29
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,420
I was out in San Francisco this was the

30
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,940
last trip I did

31
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,280
before they shut us all down

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,440
and I'm out in San Francisco and I'm

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,480
talking about the same thing we're going

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,459
to talk about today deep face

35
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,680
and you know I'm up there I'm telling

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,480
them I'm like let's not even talk about

37
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,480
election security screw that you know I

38
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,280
I everybody was talking about election

39
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,980
security it I'm talking to them about

40
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,840
hey here's how deep fakes are a threat

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,879
to your business here's how deep fakes

42
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,160
are a threat to people this is where

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,080
they're a problem

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,400
and

45
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,260
yeah

46
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,400
that hasn't changed but boy you know we

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,040
we saw a lot of things all these scary

48
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,319
headlines said oh my God deep face are

49
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,879
going to be the worst thing for the 2020

50
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,540
election oh gosh you know what will the

51
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,940
impact be to our elections deep fakes

52
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,040
threaten the 2020 election this was our

53
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,800
fear and it was legitimate right I mean

54
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,739
deep fakes are there's this crazy thing

55
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:06,360
that we can create these videos that

56
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,060
people look at and they're like

57
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,480
wait is is that really the president I

58
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,420
can't tell right it's not just videos

59
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,599
it's audio

60
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,680
you probably heard some stories we'll

61
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,840
talk about that in a little bit

62
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,159
it's

63
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,260
even just pictures

64
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,040
people are using images from sites like

65
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,260
this person doesn't exist

66
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,019
you know what I'm talking about right

67
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,700
this is what we're doing with deep

68
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,860
facing so it made sense that we were

69
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,360
worried

70
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,280
it made sense that we were scared one of

71
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,099
the most well-known deep fake videos was

72
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,080
that one that Jordan Peele did of Barack

73
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,980
Obama

74
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,480
so of course everybody thought about

75
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,700
politics right away

76
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,560
but what did we get

77
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,080
well I only got Mark Zuckerberg that was

78
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,180
a fun one we got a bunch of these tick

79
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,299
tocks of Tom Cruise like Wow way to make

80
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,580
an irrelevant do relevant again

81
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,140
okay even if you go out you'll find a

82
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,640
ton of them from the office I don't know

83
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,260
why that one is such a popular Target

84
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,720
but my God there's tons of them

85
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,939
but where's my election security problem

86
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:18,720
I was told wait we're we're not good our

87
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,579
elections are going to be overrun by

88
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,540
this

89
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,580
and it didn't happen

90
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,380
and so when Michael talked to me about

91
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,639
come in

92
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,479
decipher account 5.3

93
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,800
to do the talk that I was gonna do at

94
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,940
5.05.1 there's something wrong in the

95
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,979
math there but okay

96
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:39,840
whatever we're calling that thing that

97
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,300
didn't happen in 2020

98
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,860
I was like yeah let me let's do that but

99
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,500
if I do that talk now it's a whole

100
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,060
different ball game

101
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,860
because all of the things that people

102
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,460
were scared about we just haven't seen

103
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,560
so maybe we backtrack a little let's

104
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,120
look at this from a different

105
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,280
perspective

106
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,900
and so that's what we're gonna do we're

107
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,120
going to talk about deep face

108
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,520
for the anybody who's been living under

109
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,919
Iraq for the last you know know five

110
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,020
years and that isn't sure what depicts

111
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,220
really are

112
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,199
deep things are nothing more than ultra

113
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,900
realistic media that's created using

114
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,060
deep learning all the rhythms or machine

115
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,860
learning algorithms take your pick

116
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,740
whatever you want to call them

117
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,740
deep face itself was an attorney I was

118
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,380
coined just kind of by someone on Reddit

119
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,759
and we'll talk about that in a minute

120
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,380
but let's go back to the beginning of

121
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,500
this thing where did deep fake start

122
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,720
the technology for deep breaks is better

123
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,580
on for decades okay I mean it was 1997

124
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,340
that there was a paper released by three

125
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,380
people who now all apparently work for

126
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,100
Google shocking uh Kristoff gregler

127
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,380
Michelle Colville and yes I am reading

128
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,280
them because there's no way I was

129
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,139
remembering these names and Malcolm Stan

130
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,810
family so they did this paper in 1997

131
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,000
[Music]

132
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,520
just talking about how they could use

133
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,139
this

134
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,000
um

135
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,100
is there a tool to go to go and create

136
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,160
these videos that weren't real

137
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,340
and one of the examples you see up here

138
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,800
JFK why not right so they did a couple

139
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,479
they did like a Forrest Gump video with

140
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,520
him and a couple others and you know

141
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,039
they called their tool video bright

142
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,360
because that's what it was going to do

143
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,280
it was going to rewrite videos

144
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,780
but it didn't really go anywhere I think

145
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,039
part of the problem was we just didn't

146
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,080
really have other than in you know

147
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,819
really large academic research

148
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,620
institutions we just didn't have the

149
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,400
horsepower to do this we were not ready

150
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,740
the way we are now

151
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,440
so 2017

152
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,280
let's fast forward two decades

153
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,759
2017 is when deep face really started to

154
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,080
appear on the scene

155
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,319
so a user on Reddit named aptly deep

156
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,400
fake

157
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,900
starts posting these videos

158
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,360
and of course where does any good

159
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,280
technology always seem to take hold

160
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,280
first where tell me

161
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,340
porn of course it's always porn right

162
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,740
like where did VHS land okay it blew out

163
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,199
betamax why because porn

164
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,060
the internet what took off the most

165
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,340
first in the internet it was porn it's

166
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,160
always porn so what was he doing he was

167
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,919
creating porn

168
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,240
he was creating deep fake porn media of

169
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,580
you know Hollywood celebrities like Emma

170
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,660
Watson

171
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,539
or Gal Gadot

172
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,660
or Natalie Dormer

173
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,819
or even Natalie Portman

174
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,660
these were some of the earliest ones

175
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,220
now

176
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,660
I don't recommend you do this from your

177
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,720
work computer first and foremost

178
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,220
if you go out and you search like

179
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,280
Natalie Dormer deep fake

180
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,960
you're gonna find out they're still

181
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,639
making this stuff

182
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,919
so right there you can already start to

183
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,259
see like yeah deep fix they may not have

184
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,780
exploded on the scene when we were

185
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,940
talking election security but hey guess

186
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,080
what

187
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,758
they're still doing damage to people

188
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,440
now it's really ironic here is um

189
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,060
there's been some legislation in the

190
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,759
last you know three or four years funny

191
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,379
this when you know politicians were

192
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,819
getting scared suddenly they wanted

193
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,520
legislation to deal with deep things

194
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,979
prior to that these people were actually

195
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,200
using the very thing you would think you

196
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,240
would use to get these taken down

197
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,299
to defend keeping them back up

198
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,080
he it's amazing he used the dmca to

199
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,160
protect

200
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,140
the Deep fix that they created using

201
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,240
other people's likeness

202
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,760
so that's changing but let's talk about

203
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,320
how these things get created in the

204
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,760
first place because

205
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,200
it's going to give you some under

206
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,080
understanding of where we are today and

207
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,600
why maybe we didn't see what we thought

208
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,240
we would so how do you create a team

209
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,459
fate well deep fakes are simply created

210
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,980
with these things we call Gans

211
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,680
all right anybody who works in machine

212
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,480
learning and artificial intelligence you

213
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,279
know what again is

214
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,380
anyone who doesn't let me quickly

215
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,480
explain it and for those of you that do

216
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,399
work in machine learning in your your

217
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,100
heads down in tensorflow forgive me I'm

218
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,500
oversimplifying I know this is not a

219
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,300
hundred percent technically accurate but

220
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,120
it makes it way easier to understand so

221
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,300
again generative adversarial Network

222
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,040
listen to that name because it tells you

223
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,240
exactly what it does it's going to

224
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,580
create something using two networks that

225
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,560
work as adversaries so you have these

226
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,839
two networks the first is called the

227
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:46,920
generator

228
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,360
well that's an original name because

229
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,680
that's exactly what it does it's going

230
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,440
to just generate stuff the other side of

231
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,540
this thing is the discriminator the

232
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,040
discriminator's job is to look at what

233
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,680
the generator creates and decide

234
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,140
Is that real or fake

235
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,360
or how real is that

236
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,820
more to the point

237
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,220
so we train these things

238
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,680
we go out and this is traditional now

239
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,980
this is I I'm sitting here talking like

240
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,660
this was like a decade ago and this was

241
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,940
like four years this is 40 Years of

242
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,920
advancement right so four years ago this

243
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,240
is what we were doing with these things

244
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,100
you had a training set you got a bunch

245
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,779
of images of the person you were going

246
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,459
to try to put in your deep fake in this

247
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,839
case Barack Obama

248
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,700
sure why not

249
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,519
and you know we use these images so that

250
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,519
we can train those the discriminator and

251
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,160
the generator now there's this is one of

252
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,720
those areas where it's not totally

253
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,100
technically accurate how that actually

254
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,480
goes but

255
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,980
bear with me

256
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,500
so then we feed it some Target Media in

257
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,200
this case it's a it's an actor who sat

258
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,140
down and pretended to be Barack Obama in

259
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,839
the old wall office giving an address

260
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,360
we feed that through the generator digs

261
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,079
through it literally frame by frame

262
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,560
and it attempts to to recreate

263
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,420
that frame

264
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,339
only with the other face that it's been

265
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:09,959
trained to recreate

266
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,820
so just go in here looks at that says

267
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,600
hmm how realistic is that uh well you

268
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,240
know what not so much so it sends

269
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,120
feedback to the generator to say yeah

270
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,300
you're not there yet try again

271
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,339
and this cycle repeats and repeats and

272
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,680
repeats and repeats and repeats

273
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,079
so you can see why computing power is

274
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,000
important here right

275
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,420
so let's dig a Little

276
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,660
Pony deeper right I know they don't get

277
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,440
any better y'all I'm sorry jokes as as

278
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,240
I've been told many times by my partner

279
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,519
I am not funny

280
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,100
um and I'm okay with this so I actually

281
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,140
sat down a couple years ago and built a

282
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,060
rig to do this and I started playing

283
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,260
with it so we have this thing we call

284
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,120
the ground truth right that's kind of

285
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,760
that's where we start that's that's the

286
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,740
image of something that represents

287
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,140
something that the the generator wants

288
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,220
to recreate

289
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,500
so the way that we train these things is

290
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,959
we feed this ground truth into what we

291
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,820
call an encoder now the encoder is going

292
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,560
to use facial recognition to find all

293
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,480
the various points on your face and map

294
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,060
those out and you know other elements of

295
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,980
like colors and whatever

296
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,100
and it puts it into you know basically

297
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,100
this encoding that then the generator is

298
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,380
going to use to try to recreate it so we

299
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,079
have this decoder and the decoder's job

300
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:32,579
is to take that encoder and try to

301
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:38,599
recreate what was created by the encoder

302
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,079
we get some result okay cool yeah all

303
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,300
right that they look very similar

304
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,940
so now that goes to the discriminator

305
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,740
and as I said the discriminator takes a

306
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,839
look at the ground truth and what was

307
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,000
generated and says hey yes or no this is

308
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,200
good

309
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,720
and then it sends that feedback in the

310
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,519
form of what we call weights weights is

311
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,040
kind of how it adjusts again and way

312
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,440
over simplifying but we could spend I

313
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,880
could do a dissertation on this stuff

314
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,399
and you'd be bored to death so uh

315
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,380
ultimately that ends up in our model and

316
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,320
we Loop through this again now this is

317
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,820
where it gets kind of cool

318
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,519
so now I'm going to do this with myself

319
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,380
and Melissa Milano and this is I mean

320
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,700
all these images are actually from the

321
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,680
training I did and so I'm going to feed

322
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,480
both of those to the encoder so now I'm

323
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,920
teaching the encoder how to create not

324
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,320
one but two faces so it's looking at

325
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,300
them and it's deciding okay you know

326
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,220
it's doing all the encoding like it's

327
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,720
supposed to do for both of those faces

328
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,760
and then I'm going to hand those to two

329
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,620
different decoders decoder a is there to

330
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,079
try to make my face decoder B is there

331
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,240
to try to make Alyssa Milano's face we

332
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,120
go through that process we we teach that

333
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,399
thing we go through the learning and you

334
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,899
know our discriminator is constantly

335
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,579
updating that encoder getting it better

336
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,899
and better and better until we reach a

337
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,040
point where we're kind of like all right

338
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,240
good enough

339
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,519
that's where we want to be

340
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,200
and then all we do this is the

341
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,760
Brilliance in this thing

342
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,740
so I just take that

343
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,139
to convert this to the Deep fake video

344
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,279
all I'm going to do is I'm going to take

345
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,519
that ground truth feed it to the encoder

346
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,899
but now I'm going to switch things up

347
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,279
and I'm going to feed what was just

348
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,560
encoded to the decoder

349
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,240
and that's going to create my new frame

350
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,260
with the new face

351
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,839
now again so maybe this is this is where

352
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,360
we were four years ago right this is how

353
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,760
we did these things and the software I

354
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,839
used for this was one of the most

355
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,220
popular still around people are still

356
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,660
using it today because there's a lot of

357
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,100
research happening here let's face swap

358
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,740
but then we got more advanced you see

359
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,240
because that takes a lot of time it

360
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,040
takes a lot of horsepower yeah people

361
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,199
were doing it in gcp and whatever but it

362
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,660
but it still is it

363
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,240
so we started to researchers for

364
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,100
counseling organized like what if we

365
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,800
didn't try to like create these encoders

366
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,380
and train them on specific faces what if

367
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,019
our encoders were smarter what if they

368
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,600
could look at just the general

369
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,519
characteristics of a face and build a

370
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,199
model that could then be used to

371
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,579
generate another phase

372
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,800
and we got into what the the research

373
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,260
calls us talking heads and it's really

374
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,760
just more of a metal learning

375
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,000
environment where instead of trying to

376
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,040
you know find the specific points on

377
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,779
these two separate faces and teach a

378
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,300
model and and do all that learning it's

379
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,000
hey let's focus more on the The Meta

380
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,740
characteristics of someone's face the

381
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,620
color patterns and you know facial

382
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,740
points and whatever else and we can skip

383
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,320
a bunch of that learning now the

384
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,360
challenge is

385
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,639
you kind of have to have

386
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,000
a specific Target

387
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,699
so what you gain in speed you're kind of

388
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:49,980
given up in terms of who you can create

389
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,620
these for but it makes it repeatable so

390
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,120
now I could take a hundred different

391
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,160
faces in this room pass them through the

392
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,620
same model and very quickly after I've

393
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,899
trained the model one time create

394
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,459
multiple deep fakes of all of your faces

395
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:09,180
replaced with one person of my choosing

396
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,860
so what made things faster and this is

397
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,260
where we started seeing now all of these

398
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,480
apps right like I mean if you go you see

399
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,880
like face app does some of this not so

400
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,220
well there's a few of them out there

401
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,260
that you can download and then somewhere

402
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,120
on your phone because of course they're

403
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,339
ultimately feeding that all back to the

404
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,320
cloud and who knows whose Cloud that is

405
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,480
or where that's going

406
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,040
or what we're doing with a lot of facial

407
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,860
recognition data we just uploaded

408
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,240
so

409
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,920
consider that but that

410
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,399
they went and

411
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:44,399
and it continues to go it can keeps

412
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,759
getting better and better so okay

413
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,940
one of the more uh early ones that

414
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,579
adopted this was avatarify this one was

415
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,359
cool because it was a zoom

416
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,440
uh this gentleman in the upper right

417
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,199
here supposedly surprised A co-worker by

418
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,599
pretending to bring Elon Musk into a

419
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,339
call

420
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,559
yeah I know really

421
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,380
really a Elon Musk right

422
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,880
oh Twitter R.I.P Twitter

423
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,199
okay good point they're okay yeah

424
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,419
granted there's no popular time to bring

425
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:24,179
up Eli musk Fair

426
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,160
but where where were those election

427
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,220
depicts I was promised deep fakes I was

428
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,900
going to see candidates doing all sorts

429
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,200
of wild stuff I wanted to see Joe Biden

430
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,539
doing blow why didn't I get that video

431
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,600
see there we go see I told you I could

432
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,780
be funny once in a while

433
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,260
but seriously so why didn't this happen

434
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,179
everybody said this was going to be I

435
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,220
mean my colleagues I even bought into it

436
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,539
I figured it was going to happen I just

437
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:55,500
figured there were enough other people

438
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,039
talking about it I didn't need to

439
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:00,539
region why not

440
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,580
what we got instead of everybody was

441
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,960
like this by the way this is a really

442
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,840
cool video If you go look it up

443
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,400
um it was actually a get out and vote

444
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,299
video

445
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,120
so I mean I guess we used it for good it

446
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,400
impacted the 2020 election maybe a

447
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,440
little bit in some way but definitely

448
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,900
not what we were expecting and so the

449
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,700
question kind of comes up all right was

450
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,580
this a false alarm did like we do the

451
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,900
thing that we do in cyber security

452
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,299
really super excited and create all this

453
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,760
mess and get everybody really oh my god

454
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,140
look out it's gonna happen we're gonna

455
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,360
have deep face tomorrow

456
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,280
when there really wasn't much to worry

457
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,120
about

458
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,400
or

459
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,580
this is like Y2K

460
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,740
where we got everybody up in arms and we

461
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,600
we you know spent thousands and

462
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,460
thousands and thousands of millions of

463
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,160
dollars on consultants and oh my God

464
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,220
Cobalt programmers were cool again

465
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,380
hi now I know who is in

466
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,400
it and Y2K because you're laughing you

467
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,820
know what I'm talking about right we

468
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,039
Y2K there's there's I mean my God it

469
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,120
kills me if there's journalists out

470
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,020
there right now who are trying to say

471
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,640
Y2K was no big deal and then we over

472
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,260
blew it

473
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,080
no we just actually stirred up enough

474
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,580
excitement and got people enough

475
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,440
involved that we actually stopped it so

476
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,600
is this you know I started a political

477
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,799
thing someone's going to come after me

478
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,080
later for that but

479
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,179
the question remains with deep face

480
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,500
which is it

481
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,660
in the reality

482
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,720
it's kind of a little bit of both

483
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,580
so let's dig into that a little bit so

484
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,919
first of all

485
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,260
does anyone remember this video from

486
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,760
right around a little bit before the

487
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,220
2020 election

488
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,640
so Nancy Pelosi was at some event I

489
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,780
don't even remember what the event was

490
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,160
it's not important she gave some

491
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,039
interview

492
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,080
and you know some people on the opposite

493
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,059
side of the aisle if you will got their

494
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,919
hands on the video and what did they do

495
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,460
they slowed that video way down and it

496
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,900
may and by doing so it made her look

497
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,059
like she was drunk right because when

498
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,799
you do that with a video what happens

499
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,020
things distort

500
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,120
normal speech starts to sound really

501
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,860
Disturbed and slurred right I mean

502
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,200
that's what happens so who needs deep

503
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,640
face when you can just create a video

504
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,820
like that so they did that this video

505
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,980
millions and millions of re-shares even

506
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,740
after it was all over the news that this

507
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,900
video was faked it was a modified doctor

508
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,020
video people were still sharing it they

509
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,179
were still up in arms oh my God look at

510
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,039
how unprofessional she is she's an

511
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,200
alcoholic all this stuff

512
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,200
why do I need to spend time

513
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,480
and compute dollars if I'm using the

514
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,179
cloud to create deep fakes when all you

515
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,679
got to do is take a video and slow it

516
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,820
down

517
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,240
so the reality is here when it comes to

518
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,000
why didn't we see this why didn't we see

519
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,740
more of this well some of it is we just

520
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,000
didn't need it

521
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,740
I mean my God we had politicians

522
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,020
standing on stage screaming fake news at

523
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,940
the top of their lungs

524
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,799
it didn't even matter what the news was

525
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,980
it was oh yeah that's fake news or you

526
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,299
know I mean

527
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,340
if you can do that

528
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,440
why bother with this

529
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,919
so that definitely plays into it

530
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:19,020
so one of the things I talked about when

531
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,640
I said I was out there in 2020 talking

532
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,840
about this one thing I was talking about

533
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,480
was what about Market manipulation

534
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,100
like let's think in the business world

535
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,240
what if I created a deep fake of a high

536
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,000
level figure you know maybe the

537
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,620
aforementioned new owner of Twitter

538
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,179
whoop I jumped ahead here somehow let's

539
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,740
go back

540
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,640
um

541
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,140
spoiler uh yeah so you know that was my

542
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,000
thought like and I talked about ways you

543
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,980
could like conduct

544
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,900
a fight in cyber trading things like

545
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,340
that and of course we didn't see much of

546
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,200
that either we've seen a little bit

547
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,240
there has been some attempts but not

548
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,059
really anything we have people building

549
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,559
businesses

550
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,480
on the idea that they would detect deep

551
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,059
fakes targeting your company

552
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,740
all right I met some of them at black

553
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,580
hat two years ago

554
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,500
fruition I'm not sure if that company

555
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,940
still around it'd be actually

556
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,700
interesting to go see instead

557
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,980
we did get

558
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,100
some World opinion manipulation just

559
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,620
recently right I mean

560
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,240
who had this one

561
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,799
on their deep fake Springfield card

562
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,320
with a nation

563
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,980
using deep

564
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,419
for wartime propaganda

565
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:40,679
how

566
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,320
did we not see that coming

567
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,679
well the reality is we kind of did

568
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,720
um this is probably one of my favorite

569
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,200
books of the last 10 years

570
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,360
Theresa Payton she was

571
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,799
um I'm not even going to try to say it

572
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,539
now because I'm spacing on her exact

573
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:58,799
title

574
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,840
but she wrote this book in 2020. now I

575
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,640
was mostly focused on Election security

576
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,919
but honestly if you can't go out and

577
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,480
pick up this book because this book does

578
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,240
an amazing job talking about the

579
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,520
concepts of misinformation and how it

580
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,320
actually works

581
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,059
because it's important to understand

582
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,340
that as we look at Deep fakes and we

583
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,840
look at their implications and things

584
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,760
like the world markets and we think

585
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,460
about how they could impact our politics

586
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,039
or they could be used in other horrible

587
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,220
ways ultimately all they are at their

588
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,340
core is misinformation

589
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,900
that's it

590
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,280
and what makes any psyops misinformation

591
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,640
style campaign successful are the same

592
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,460
things that make deep fake videos go

593
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,080
viral

594
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,840
so I recommend it if you if you have the

595
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,120
opportunity grab a copy of this book it

596
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,520
is awesome for understanding some of

597
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,539
that

598
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:57,179
but what about audio tax no that was

599
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:58,919
another thing I talked about

600
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:00,960
two years ago when I was given the talk

601
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,480
on deep face and you know at that point

602
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,460
there had been one case where one

603
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,600
company claimed at least that there uh I

604
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,760
think it was like a divisional president

605
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,039
got duped into transferring a couple

606
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,919
hundred thousand Euros to attackers and

607
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:18,419
the claim was that you know well they

608
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:21,179
use deep fake audio to to fit the CEO's

609
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:21,919
voice

610
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,360
I say that kind of sarcastically because

611
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,340
there's a lot of skepticism and looking

612
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,960
into the facts of it I'm not sure I

613
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,059
really buy it

614
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:32,280
but more recently we do have one that

615
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,320
does actually seem to be legitimate

616
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,000
partially because one of the reasons

617
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,140
that makes me feel like this might

618
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,280
actually be the case because it was

619
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,840
combined with business email compromise

620
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,580
now that sounds like the attackers we

621
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,120
know and love

622
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,780
so

623
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,419
it is out there but again it's not like

624
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,159
this is something that is blown up on

625
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,260
the scenes because again why would I

626
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,880
spend a bunch of time crafting emails

627
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,880
to not only just push somebody but then

628
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,860
you know create this deep fake audio

629
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,140
that I'm going to use to then try to

630
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,940
further that attack

631
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,440
I'm only going to do is send one

632
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,539
phishing email to some poor admin

633
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,520
assistant who isn't you know so busy

634
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,960
that they're not totally paying

635
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,159
attention and they click on it

636
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,620
so you know it's not that the attack

637
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,240
vectors disappear

638
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,220
it's not that the attack Vector was

639
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,840
overblown

640
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,179
it's simply that there are just so many

641
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:28,919
easier attack vectors out there right

642
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:29,940
now

643
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,539
that work and work consistently that

644
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:36,840
maybe this isn't the one that we need

645
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,640
so

646
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,840
here's the last piece of this there is a

647
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,539
ton of research going on two years ago

648
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:46,980
when we thought this thing was going to

649
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,559
crush our elections you had many of the

650
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:52,020
biggest names in the media Google

651
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,299
Facebook Twitter

652
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:59,220
Amazon my Microsoft all put in money

653
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,320
to sponsor this million dollar challenge

654
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,240
for researchers to come up with deep

655
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,159
fake detections

656
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,740
but we got a lot of them like we started

657
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,059
really simple in the upper left there

658
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:12,120
you see our favorite villain once again

659
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,140
Mr

660
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,799
Twitter now

661
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,659
but it was really easy you used to

662
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:20,220
originally all you had to do to tell a d

663
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,360
pick was you could kind of look at it

664
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,460
you could see distortions you could tell

665
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,700
that like things just didn't fit right

666
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,159
so you know within a couple months of

667
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:30,960
that research being released well okay

668
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,960
now we've made cans better so then we

669
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,059
moved down below and we see one of our

670
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:37,740
other favorite villains from the

671
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,480
political Spectrum

672
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,880
and

673
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,500
you know

674
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,260
now it was you know they figured out hey

675
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,779
the Deep fake algorithms aren't

676
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,360
replicating eye blinks very well because

677
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,799
think about you're training these things

678
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,419
off of pictures that you have of these

679
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,159
public figures how often do you see

680
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,659
pictures of public figures with their

681
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,700
eyes closed

682
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,260
not very often

683
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,100
so you know it was tough I but it didn't

684
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,380
take long literally the paper that I

685
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,659
pulled that picture from was released

686
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:11,039
and two months later we were already

687
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,980
seeing updated versions of the facial

688
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,620
recognition and the Gans in face swap

689
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,380
that were already reproducing eye blinks

690
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,940
at an appropriate rate and with

691
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,860
appropriate speeds and everything else I

692
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,480
mean they had this really it's really

693
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,980
impressive how they dig into some of the

694
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,440
stuff right so all right well then

695
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,900
someone had a great idea this was kind

696
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,000
of cool they said well what if we don't

697
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,400
try to detect the media at all

698
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,559
what if we actually look at what the

699
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,840
person in the media is doing and try to

700
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,000
match that up to the context

701
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,320
talking about

702
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,200
so they started mapping behaviors so we

703
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,260
hear see yet another political figure

704
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,679
villain depending on your how you sit

705
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:53,880
um but

706
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,980
what do they do they took hours and

707
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,799
hours of Barack Obama videos

708
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,419
and they started to map out his

709
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,480
behaviors they look for very specific

710
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,460
facial patterns and movements and other

711
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,100
things you know little ticks and things

712
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,960
that were common

713
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,419
to various types of content that he was

714
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,039
talking about you know so when he was

715
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,380
talking about something very serious but

716
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,900
you know where he needed to be more of

717
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,760
that compassionate voice you could see

718
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,260
it there were things about his face that

719
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,299
made it very clear and other times when

720
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:25,799
he was like you know delivering a really

721
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:28,740
strongly worded speech to North Korea

722
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,779
well yeah suddenly you know his browse

723
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,760
for all things like that

724
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,700
and so for a while this was really

725
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,380
accurate like really accurate we're

726
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,960
talking like 90 percent

727
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,539
only issue is

728
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,400
first of all to do it you have to have

729
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,340
that big database of every you know all

730
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,140
this different video of that subject so

731
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,520
you can actually learn those models

732
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,279
which then in turn means there's kind of

733
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,740
a limited set of people that you're

734
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,000
going to be able to create those models

735
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,880
for so I you know it was cool but maybe

736
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,620
not the answer

737
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,419
now the last one

738
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:05,159
this was really impressive this came out

739
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,559
about a year and a half

740
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,299
and in this study what they figured out

741
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:11,400
was they could actually detect and this

742
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,200
is the part that's really cool they

743
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,260
could actually detect your heartbeat

744
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,179
through the video

745
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,279
and what they found is that what they

746
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,419
were doing and I'm not going to get into

747
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,039
all the specifics because I barely

748
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,380
understand it so there's no way I'm

749
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,700
going to be able

750
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,720
to be able to y'all understand it

751
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,360
exactly but what you were able to do and

752
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,740
then what they found out is that in the

753
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,080
Deep fake videos those same markers that

754
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,700
indicated a heartbeat just simply

755
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,260
weren't there

756
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,240
so this was like 94 95 96 but already

757
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,000
deep fake creators have figured out ways

758
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,480
to not necessarily bypass this but

759
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,919
they're basically frustrate those

760
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,480
algorithms altogether

761
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,980
and break them

762
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,820
that's some hacker [ __ ] right there eh

763
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,039
so I mean and there's people still

764
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,539
looking I've seen maybe you've seen

765
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:01,919
pictures of it there's people looking at

766
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,559
how can I do my makeup in a certain way

767
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,600
that thwarts the facial recognition

768
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,640
algorithms that are needed for this

769
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,380
people are doing that to avoid it in

770
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,299
countries where that's really common not

771
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:13,799
that we would do it here in the us and

772
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,639
our airports or anything

773
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,440
but here's the thing these are all

774
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,000
Technical Solutions

775
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,799
as I said

776
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,620
this is a misinformation situation and

777
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,020
when we talk about misinformation

778
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,159
misinformation is not a technical

779
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:31,620
problem it is a human problem

780
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,360
so when we sit down and we look at this

781
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,700
and we say okay why didn't this impact

782
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,580
the election why are deep fakes not more

783
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,200
of a problem did we did we solve it

784
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,419
yeah someone this is the other side

785
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,100
remember I said okay it's kind of a

786
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,779
false alarm it's also kind of like Y2K

787
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:50,520
because the one thing we did really

788
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,320
really well

789
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,360
who's got the news out there these

790
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,799
things existed

791
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,960
now they went both ways they also kind

792
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,279
of worked against us because you had

793
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,080
politicians who were legitimately caught

794
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,580
on tape doing things who were claiming

795
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,840
all in all that's a deep fake that

796
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,000
wasn't me

797
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,440
well you know I guess that was

798
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,720
predictable but

799
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,159
how do we deal with this misinformation

800
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:13,320
because this is the problem

801
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,380
is we've seen now in the last few years

802
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,899
is that this

803
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,179
like once someone's buying into this

804
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,860
crap trying to get that out of their

805
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,940
heads is

806
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,039
insanely difficult

807
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:29,100
so the reason is because what

808
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,140
misinformation does it first of all it

809
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,960
plays off of our existing prejudices our

810
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,700
existing biases all the things that we

811
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,320
believe all the things that we want to

812
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,240
believe

813
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,299
and so it's like you know people will

814
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,399
actually be willing to just ignore every

815
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,279
sign of oh that's way wrong and there's

816
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,279
no way that's credible because I want to

817
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:51,960
believe it and we've seen that we've

818
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,940
seen a political discourse it's you know

819
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,559
we see that all over the place we see it

820
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:59,178
with pandemic information right

821
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,120
what we do when we're going to launch a

822
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,039
misinformation campaign

823
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,440
is we attack what we call logic changes

824
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,140
in our brain so when I'm processing

825
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,059
information and I'm looking at a cause

826
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:14,340
and effect there's this logical chain of

827
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,399
events that leads from what I see as the

828
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,500
cause to what I see is the effect

829
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,980
what I see as the evidence to what I see

830
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,620
as the truth

831
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,899
misinformation just lodges itself in the

832
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,580
middle of that logic chain and that

833
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,919
makes it really difficult to get rid of

834
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,240
it

835
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,279
our brains don't have that big undo

836
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,779
button that sometimes I think we all

837
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:38,820
wish we had

838
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,659
so what do we do about this and why

839
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,760
did I say that we got the news out and

840
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,679
that was helpful so when you're going to

841
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,559
try to debunk misinformation

842
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:52,919
the very first key here is to get the

843
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,080
warning out that it exists

844
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,000
okay because by getting this warning out

845
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,640
people are expecting it

846
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,260
now people know to be more skeptical

847
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,960
at least you hope they will be and in

848
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,240
many cases they do and this works again

849
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,840
this is this is stuff militaries and you

850
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,880
know uh intelligence agencies have been

851
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,340
doing for hundreds and hundreds of years

852
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,340
this is not new

853
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,399
so what we need to do is start first of

854
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,779
all just get that warning out but then

855
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:30,000
it's all right I need to somehow and

856
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,220
this is the challenging part now

857
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,960
I need to take that piece of information

858
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,480
that got stuck in your logic team and

859
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,980
I've got to replace it with something

860
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,720
else

861
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,000
it sounds like a simple concept but oh

862
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,960
my God think about this for a minute

863
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,279
you've got this thing that's embedded

864
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,960
it's something that somebody wanted to

865
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,360
believe because they hated this person

866
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,460
this politician so much

867
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,140
they just they wanted to believe it

868
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,940
regardless you're trying to take that

869
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,799
out of that logic chain and you have to

870
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,720
replace it with something else that is

871
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,019
equally credible to that person

872
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,460
and that's where we struggle

873
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,339
but then the last piece of it is you

874
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,159
have to keep repeating that because now

875
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,199
even if you've successfully gotten into

876
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,379
that logic and you've you've wiped out

877
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:18,119
what there was a piece of misinformation

878
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:20,639
that they were leveraging and you've

879
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,399
replaced it with the actual truth

880
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:26,219
you're not done because there's tags at

881
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,839
that all the time that you're trying to

882
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,379
afford and so constantly repeating that

883
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:34,739
credible truth which God that almost

884
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,060
sounds like alternate truth I can't

885
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,379
actually just believe I said credible

886
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:38,520
truth

887
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,199
but that's the reality because when I

888
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,520
say credible in that case I'm talking

889
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,460
about credible in their heads right

890
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,679
which actually for you and I who might

891
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,780
disagree with whoever it is that we're

892
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,719
talking about maybe to us it's not

893
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,800
credible

894
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,739
but it's the credible thing to them

895
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,320
and that's where this becomes truly

896
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,140
challenging this is the battle that

897
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,080
we're fighting and our piece of it from

898
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,880
a cyber security perspective even though

899
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,280
I know we're talking Tech and deep fakes

900
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,680
we're one piece of that

901
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,000
but we're not alone in that

902
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,320
so

903
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,240
before I wrap things up I wanted to

904
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,040
leave you with this because I think this

905
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,280
is something that really drives it home

906
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,900
it's very bezmannoff for those of you

907
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,180
that don't know as a former KGB agent

908
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,579
who's on the talk circuit he wrote books

909
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,859
everything else

910
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,480
but it's funny because as we've been

911
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,040
going through the last few years of this

912
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,380
pandemic and the political Spectrum I

913
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,960
keep thinking of this quote

914
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,240
talking about

915
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,000
what how misinformation functions what

916
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,859
the goals are

917
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:49,260
the Soviets back in the 80s when Yuri

918
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,240
was doing this they called it

919
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,180
ideological subversion I won't read the

920
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,320
whole quote to you hopefully you can

921
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,700
take a picture of it or you can read it

922
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,740
from where you're sitting but the gist

923
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,200
is basically we want to overload you

924
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,900
with so much conflicting information and

925
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,160
so much you know BS that you'll make

926
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,200
decisions well first of all you'll be so

927
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,400
wrong you want to know how to make a

928
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,079
decision but the decisions you end up

929
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,180
making actually are against your own

930
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,740
best interests

931
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,599
now if you think of what we've seen in

932
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:20,160
the last few years I think probably

933
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,440
everyone in this room regardless of your

934
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,240
opinions on any of these topics you can

935
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,800
think of cases where you've seen that

936
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,720
happen

937
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,579
so this is the reality of what we're

938
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:32,040
dealing with

939
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,720
there's lots of really cool things that

940
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,859
have happened with deep fakes right

941
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,099
there's a lot of great things

942
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:39,900
technology is insanely cool we're seeing

943
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,420
it used in movies

944
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,900
we're seeing people take things like the

945
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,060
Luke Skywalker scene from Mandalorian

946
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,920
and redo it and make it more realistic

947
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,540
than the CGI that they used to

948
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,940
originally create it like that is cool

949
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,440
if you haven't seen that one yet look it

950
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,079
up it is impressive

951
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,839
foreign

952
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,660
stuff but it all comes back to what do

953
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,220
we say all the time in security it's the

954
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,980
human factor right

955
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,900
that's where we're at that's where we're

956
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,339
at with depicts they continue to get

957
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:13,500
more and more impressive

958
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,480
like I said every mousetrap we build

959
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,060
just creates stronger mice

960
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,119
so kind of like every other aspect of

961
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,160
cyber security this isn't something

962
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,140
we're going to win it's something we're

963
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,820
going to continue to fight back and

964
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,579
forth back and forth so I encourage you

965
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:30,960
all to get in touch with me it's been

966
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,359
great being here like again I'm so

967
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,099
excited first of all that cybercon's

968
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:37,619
back second that I'm actually here in my

969
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:39,420
hometown for the first time in my life

970
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,180
giving a talk in my hometown

971
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,619
um you all have been amazing I can't

972
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,119
wait to see you around the rest of the

973
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,859
conference do connect with me on social

974
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:49,500
media whichever of your preference I'll

975
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,940
be on Twitter for as long as it

976
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,320
continues to be a viable option

977
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,180
not that I'm biased against Elon Musk or

978
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,700
anything I promise

979
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,440
so awesome why everybody Take Care thank

980
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,220
