00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:29,238
[Music]

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,920
okay

4
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,839
oh

5
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,760
hi guys yay welcome to the batch panel

6
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,159
all right

7
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,360
so uh why don't we start there is a very

8
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,640
impressive

9
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,080
i mean i'm a little biased but there's a

10
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,560
very impressive group of individuals up

11
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,479
here on the stage and so i'm going to

12
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,479
have them introduce themselves and what

13
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,159
badges they're known for

14
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,159
and then we can get to some rapid fire

15
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,200
questions

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,200
okay um

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,080
let's start with

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,600

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,840

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,479

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,880
done dc26

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,240
and we do

29
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,520
now the disk badges

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,159
michael or copykit mike

31
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,399
mk factor is our badge thing and so we

32
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,479
did defcon last year and we'll do it

33
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,598
this year and

34
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,680
uh we do saintcon for the last five

35
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,920
years

36
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,160
oh wow you guys do this too

37
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,319
we did it one year amazing

38
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,319
amazing

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,239
i'm mike's wife or katie from mk factor

40
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,560
i'm twinkle twinkie i mostly am known

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,959
for shitty add-ons and really annoying

42
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,840
things that make

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,519
baby noises

44
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,280
it took me a week to make

45
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,280
all right well let's go ahead and start

46
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,720
so um apparently we have questions maybe

47
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,800
coming from discord

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,319
okay so we've got maybe questions coming

49
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,680
from a discord we'd love to take

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,519
questions from you guys and then we also

51
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,720
had questions that we had from twitter

52
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,599
so

53
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,000
let's start with twitter

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,120
and

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,159
uh

56
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,239
we'll try to keep these shortish answers

57
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,720
how about that um first one how long

58
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,680
does the initial concept or design phase

59
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,760
last not just the physical structure of

60
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,159
the badge but the overall functionality

61
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,760
of it um

62
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,239
it never ends

63
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,799
we're designing up until the end

64
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,959
okay

65
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,560
for another it's about a 15-month

66
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,080
process and there's usually about three

67
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,680
months of overlap with the production of

68
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,120
the previous year's badge that we're

69
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,360
doing

70
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,799
yeah we're different because we do

71
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,280
several a year uh i think the most we

72
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,080
usually get is maybe

73
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,000
our parts ordered and what not about

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,560
five months out at the very least

75
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,400
you know unless they shut down the whole

76
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,799
planet

77
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,720
and i would say for toy makers like the

78
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,319
if you're talking about just the initial

79
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,080
concept and design

80
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,400
i would say it's a night

81
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,760
where we sit

82
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,280
and

83
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,280
feature creep until we realize we should

84
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,200
stop

85
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,040
and then we go from there or fall asleep

86
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,959
yeah yeah and then there's always the

87
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,358
badges that you design in 15 minutes

88
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,880
that you shelve and you keep coming back

89
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,639
to every year and then you shelve it

90
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,919
again

91
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,759
and and now you have a pink fluffy

92
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,759
flamingo

93
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,199
it's been percolating for a while

94
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,320
all right um

95
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
why don't we take a picture from discord

96
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,400
or a picture of a question

97
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,360
through a con

98
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,240
hardest badge to build

99
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,160
not only maintain

100
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,120
sorry not

101
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,440
maintain build but maintain through a

102
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,440
con i should just give you the link

103
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,000
which one do we have to fix the most

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,520
phone badge

105
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,960
i think for the toy makers the phone

106
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
badge was probably the one

107
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,000
because we came to the con with like 130

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,280
complete

109
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,360
and we had to solder through the night

110
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,000
and fix through the night to

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,039
accommodate 400

112
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,199
the hilton badges very nice they will

113
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,520
let you stay in their bar until 6 a.m

114
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,000
and not even really bother you yeah

115
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,840
yeah for us it was the cowboy badge with

116
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,280
the sd cards

117
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,120
we were constantly replacing those

118
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,800
things and troubleshooting with people

119
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,960
even after defcon

120
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,320
not so much anymore thankfully

121
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,520
probably our saintcon 2019 badge

122
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,680
the boards showed up to my house the day

123
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,840
before the conference and we assembled

124
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,759
1200 of them with a

125
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,759
group of volunteers and it was

126
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,680
nuts and we had to reprogram them

127
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,440
multiple times throughout the conference

128
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,560
it was horrible 1200

129
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,039
and my husband has a thing about

130
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,000
sandwich boards so we had to screw

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,160
all the sandwich boards together that

132
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,360
day as well

133
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,800
and put 26 buttons on each of them

134
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,840
it was a great time

135
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,840
i haven't really had any trouble with

136
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,639
the

137
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,560
only handful i've made my time was

138
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,639
coming uh but the first badge i helped

139
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,479
someone build was a triple badge and it

140
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,880
was made out of synthetic fur with a

141
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,199
bunch of um adafruit up to shelf parts

142
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,120
soldered together and so we spend more

143
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,720
time fixing our bath solder joints

144
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,919
all right

145
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,360
mk factor guys day before

146
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,599
dude our our thing doesn't even

147
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,120
that doesn't even match up

148
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
on last year what surprises you that's

149
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,039
true that's true

150
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,319
all right so let's take a question from

151
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,479
one of you guys

152
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,199
anybody does anyone have a question yes

153
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,280
uh let's can we get a mic too

154
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,720
mine actually builds off that question i

155
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,960
was wondering about the n and not xr

156
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,479
badge with the light pipes how many

157
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,479
light pipes did you replace after that

158
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,680
actually not many uh we carried these

159
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,319
little ziploc bags that look like

160
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,120
some sort of narcotic and

161
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,639
if anyone was missing we just hand them

162
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,639
out we intentionally bought

163
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,360
maybe 30 40 more than we needed but it

164
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,440
wasn't an issue i remember really having

165
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,240
to deal with too much

166
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,319
all right next question

167
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,120
uh how do you deal with con operators

168
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,440
so we are very fortunate with cypher

169
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,440
khan getzman is an amazing operator

170
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,639
he um i think he left you can be honest

171
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,800
no

172
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,680
no truly like there are many different

173
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,520
con operators and

174
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,039
some are responsive some are

175
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,360
non-responsive some are

176
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,960
um

177
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
like to get into the weeds

178
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,080
but if you let the toy makers run

179
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
with it then we feature creep to our

180
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,440
hearts content

181
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,440
and usually that just is ridiculous so

182
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,039
gutzman is like perfect you know um and

183
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,400
it was his question

184
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,559
so

185
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
what's it like uh dealing with the board

186
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,000
houses doing really really weird things

187
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,919
like do they get angry with you or do

188
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,440
they love you or do they hate you or

189
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,920
whatever

190
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,440
we don't care

191
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,160
uh frankly we uh generally how it goes

192
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,240
is we send them a design

193
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,920
and they will say i don't know if this

194
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,240
will work and we say please do it anyway

195
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,279
your best

196
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,440
will you ask for a refund probably not

197
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,600
okay

198
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,320
it works out ninety percent of the time

199
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,480
and it doesn't it sometimes it's our

200
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,519
fault sometimes it's their fault

201
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,720
but

202
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,880
the the neat thing about it is

203
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,600
unless you're doing the the really cool

204
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,959
extreme stuff it's stuff that's

205
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,880
generally done after we get some boards

206
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,839
from them

207
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,880
um

208
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,480
a lot of the really cool net uh

209
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,839
techniques and stuff it doesn't matter

210
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,200
if they're making

211
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,519
a piece of round

212
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,920
board or if it's making an art board

213
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,800
it's the exact same process it's someone

214
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,320
watching the machine making sure that it

215
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,760
keeps on running they don't really pay

216
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,600
attention

217
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,760
it's only when it's actually more of a

218
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,000
frustration in my experience comes from

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,680
when you give them a design

220
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,959
and then

221
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,440
someone whose job is to make slight

222
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,200
corrections to make it easier for them

223
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,080
to make

224
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,720
completely up your boards

225
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,000
um

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,120
i don't know about you guys but that's

227
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,839
been in my

228
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,160
health so like they'll be like you sure

229
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,399
you want it this way yes please make it

230
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,640
this way exactly like this do not change

231
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,040
it but every now and then

232
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,560
they'll change it and it's kind of

233
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,240
frustrating but they're usually pretty

234
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,480
good to work with and we'll produce

235
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,120
another set

236
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,920
in my experience the u.s fabs are a lot

237
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,240
easier to deal with on that and mostly

238
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,760
because the

239
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,000
the language is not really as much of a

240
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,240
barrier there's not as much time delay

241
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,680
and it's easier to communicate this is

242
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
my intent i want to make art i don't

243
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,040
necessarily care about your

244
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,720
manufacturing process

245
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,079
they'll charge you for it but

246
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,200
yeah and i think for us um

247
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,040
the only complaint we've ever had is so

248
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,000
we design our art in 1200 dpi

249
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,160
and sometimes that causes our file sizes

250
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
to be extremely large

251
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,000
so i think one time the fab was just

252
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,880
like

253
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,720
we can't handle this

254
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,880
size so you need to like

255
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,560
decrease the size i think we had to go

256
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,279
from 12 megabytes down to two i think it

257
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,320
was

258
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,079
yeah that was fun but

259
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,839
we managed to do it without you know

260
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,959
sacrificing any um quality that was

261
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,360
actually for this one the the drago's

262
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,000
badge so

263
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,320
all right

264
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,839
so

265
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,320
quick oh

266
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,000
oh what's the pin out for these badges

267
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,079
there's a tweet out there

268
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,320
all right

269
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,640
there is a tweet out there on that one

270
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,839
so just

271
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,000
hopefully guessman echoed it out on the

272
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
cyphercon but we tweeted it at cyphercon

273
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,240
there should be a screenshot

274
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,000
his twitter handle is wire engineer

275
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,079
all right a question from discord sure

276
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,399
okay um what's your favorite scope creep

277
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,399
feature that you were able to add and

278
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,920
what's a feature that you really wanted

279
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,880
to fit in but could not

280
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,760
for me the saintcon 2019 badge

281
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,720
we had a big led matrix big enough that

282
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,399
normal driver chips wouldn't do it and

283
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,519
so i got to put an fpga on it and

284
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,200
do all that design work which was a lot

285
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,279
of fun

286
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,360
probably the second screen on our

287
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,680
2020 badge

288
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,600
getting to run those simultaneously with

289
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,440
one microcontroller was was a lot of

290
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,680
feature creep and a big challenge

291
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,600
uh on that same badge we intended to put

292
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,880
ir

293
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,440
and just could not fit in the time to

294
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,120
add that to the firmware

295
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,880
so i regretted having to remove it but

296
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,800
it would have been a great feature

297
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,560
kobe wouldn't have allowed it anyways

298
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,120
does anyone here uh

299
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
know the wisconsin badge the cheese

300
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,160
badge

301
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,160
so you'll see a lot yellow ones shave

302
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,560
the state there's like 50

303
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,240
of the largest cities in wisconsin are

304
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,000
all leds on it and they have little

305
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,519
metal

306
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,839
touch sensitive pads around them

307
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,160
but to

308
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,760
do it and have the traces all fit on the

309
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,079
processor has to flip modes it's using

310
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,720
the same traces to light up the leds as

311
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,120
to do the touch sensitive pads

312
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,800
and i was working on it

313
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,440
in the car on the way to defcon

314
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,920
bouncing ir off the ceiling in in the

315
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,240
car talking between badges and i was

316
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,519
trying and trying and trying to get that

317
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,760
processor to flip over fast enough but

318
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,240
stay long enough to do the

319
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,800
cap sense of the touch sensitivity while

320
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,360
still being having the uh the leds

321
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,880
bright enough so that it was nice and

322
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,120
sparkly and i just couldn't get there

323
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,320
i'm still sad about that one

324
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,920
i think for mine the cube badge which is

325
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,079
still my favorite batch to date

326
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,360
so when you fix the computer in the game

327
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,079
you can go into the computer and you can

328
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,920
do stuff in the computer

329
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,199
but the feature creep that i

330
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,959
particularly liked was that you could go

331
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:23,680
from

332
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,079
the computer in your badge to the

333
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,160
computer in another badge to the

334
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,399
computer in another badge and you could

335
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,040
actually like have a group chat if you

336
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,800
if everybody was logged into the same

337
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,920
badge

338
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,760
um that was way overkill but i thought

339
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,480
it was really fun

[Music]

341
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,839
don't touch the hypercube that's right

342
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,199
all right a question from twitter where

343
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,920
can we pre-order you know so we can have

344
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,240
all the things

345
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,160
twitter

346
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,959
it's always twitter

347
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,959
and then with us it's a pre-buy

348
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,959
cyphercon digital badge before they run

349
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,760
out

350
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,639
um yeah

351
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,959
all right any more questions from the

352
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,959
audience

353
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,600
if not we can go to discord

354
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,759
have you found anyone in america and

355
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,800
obviously who are they um that are have

356
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,720
started to compete with china on cost

357
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,040
and turn around for pcbs specifically

358
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,519
the type of prototype and short runs

359
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,560
that we

360
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,260
use for badges

[Music]

362
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,440
yeah i haven't found a lot of us

363
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,320
board fats that come even close to toss

364
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,000
but if you need them quick

365
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
that's definitely

366
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,320
better

367
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,160
it's

368
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,720
it's kind of hard to

369
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,120
look go on jlc pcb and look at a

370
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,199
two-layer board that's 10 centimeters by

371
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,839
10 centimeters and that's 20 bucks

372
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,920
shipped and then go to osh park and that

373
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,839
same board is 40

374
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,680
but

375
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,680
our part quality is not good enough

376
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,880
it's great

377
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,199
it's equivalent to a production like a

378
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,079
real

379
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,959
this isn't a product board so

380
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,120
whether you scale it up and do a lot of

381
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
work with them or only do a couple it is

382
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,279
that quality period the words you get

383
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,279
out of china

384
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,759
they're they're good enough they're fine

385
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,519
and that that's all you're looking for

386
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,120
you get what you pay for and that's kind

387
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,839
of the bottom line on

388
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,279
that agree for so osh park um

389
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,639
you pay

390
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,440
per three pcbs so they're really good

391
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,240
for

392
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,720
prototypes smaller prototypes and ones

393
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,320
that are shipped

394
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,559
technically free within the u.s

395
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,959
um those are really nice now for the

396
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,359
flamingo badge again

397
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,640
when i mentioned in the opening

398
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,079
ceremonies that

399
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,880
you know the chinese fabs were closed

400
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,119
so we actually contacted

401
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,439
five different fads in america

402
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,799
to see who we could afford honestly

403
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,520
and we had ranges from

404
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,439
eighty dollars aboard

405
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,240
to

406
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,039
like fifteen dollars award

407
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,000
and there's no way that a budget you

408
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,080
know would be able to accommodate eighty

409
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,520
dollars a board

410
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,280
not assembled

411
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,120
just straight up board

412
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,520
um but the particular

413
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,240
um so the pink boards that you guys have

414
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
we actually were able to go to the fab

415
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,640
they're called trc circuits

416
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,520
and they were very reasonably priced um

417
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,480
i met the guy who mixed the paints

418
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,200
for the solder mask he was like

419
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,440
i've never made pink solder mask but i

420
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,679
hope this color's okay

421
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,120
and like the boards were already made so

422
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,400
we were kind of like

423
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,559
yes they're great

424
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,480
um but uh yeah so in in the us i would

425
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,080
say

426
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,600
i've asked a lot of different ones but

427
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,360
trc circuits i

428
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,640
would recommend them they were nice to

429
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,880
work with we got to visit their fab and

430
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,240
they're in minneapolis

431
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,320
all right next question

432
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,400
what license do you release your code

433
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
with

434
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
if you release your code

435
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,000
i believe we do mit

436
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,760
we didn't have any last year so my

437
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,600
memory's a little bit flaky on that but

438
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,840
i think it's mit and we'll at least

439
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
under public domain if people want we

440
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,280
just don't want to support it anymore

441
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,559
going back to the maintenance question

442
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,440
yeah we just throw it up on github is

443
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,640
someone else's problems then

444
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,919
yeah when we do release it it's mit

445
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,520
license if we can

446
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,360
and usually that is the case it's just a

447
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,120
good license for anything related to

448
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,799
hardware really there's no strings

449
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,640
attached after the fact so it's it's a

450
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,600
really easy one to use

451
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,559
any questions from discord

452
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,240
what is your favorite badge built by

453
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,640
somebody else

454
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,200
26 the toy makers because it was the

455
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,280
badge that made everybody know who i was

456
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,880
it was a really really fun year

457
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,679
um

458
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,440
this is going to be dumb

459
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,039
some

460
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,520
guy at defcon he made

461
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,120
a wood-burned

462
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,480
uh

463
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,240
villain ted

464
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,679
one i can't remember his name in the

465
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,880
moment

466
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,799
but it's my favorite out of all the

467
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,799
badges i've gotten that one was my

468
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,679
favorite find

469
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,159
um for me it's got to be the the paper

470
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,640
tape badge that you guys did it was

471
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,480
so much fun and i actually got to buy

472
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,320
one today so i'm super excited to play

473
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,559
with it

474
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,559
uh for me it was probably the same con

475
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,320
i don't even know what year was but it

476
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,159
was the one where you guys

477
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,400
had the villages do like different

478
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,320
little mini badges

479
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,440
bloody brilliant i was like

480
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,280
amazing off off sourcing offshoring the

481
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,799
like extra little bits to other villages

482
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,679
clever

483
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,960
yeah

484
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,039
uh as far as badges i don't have the

485
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,360
ninja networks def con 18

486
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,799
badge is probably my favorite that's

487
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,720
where i caught the bug

488
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,120
badges i do have the square con squid

489
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,600
badge is absolutely gorgeous and that

490
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,679
you're doing things ahead of stuff we're

491
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,679
doing now so

492
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,280
those are the two

493
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,559
yeah i was definitely going to say queer

494
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,320
con and basically anything they've done

495
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,720
so far it's all been amazing

496
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,960
nothing in you know particular from them

497
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,280
either it's just any of the queer gun

498
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,919
badges are great

499
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,559
yeah i'd have to go with the squid

500
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,840
well that squid was that year they

501
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,360
actually

502
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,760
uh the queer con team is

503
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,120
uh amazing the whole term badge light

504
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,240
was theirs george you know put that and

505
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,039
bad life if you are a consumer of the

506
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,640
badges is an appreciation of the work

507
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,240
the people who make it is an expression

508
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,640
of the misery

509
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,120
because it is it is very very very

510
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,280
difficult um

511
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,000
a lot of sleepless nights uh a lot of

512
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,039
money

513
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,480
a very big risk and it's all for fun

514
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,559
most of us won't even do it for a career

515
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,159
in any way

516
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,240
um but that year

517
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,280
uh was the first badge that had an

518
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,679
add-on and it was not the current shitty

519
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,840
add-on it was the predecessor to the

520
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,120
shitty add-on

521
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,039
so the blooper badge is

522
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,960
one of my favorite badges

523
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,120
period it was incredible

524
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,120
all right uh next question oh

525
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,159
yes

526
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,679
uh

527
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,400
how do you decide between uh a lipo or

528
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,480
something rechargeable versus disposable

529
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,039
batteries on a badge

530
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,280
lipo batteries were really popular in

531
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,799
the earlier days

532
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,720
um but then we all realized that people

533
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,039
keep metal sharp objects in their bags

534
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,480
that poke them

535
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,760
oh yeah

536
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,640
so

537
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,480
different teams use different things but

538
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,640
i refuse to not use anything that's on a

539
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,360
double a or triple a or smaller just not

540
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,520
a lipo

541
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,840
so i think for us uh

542
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,760
depends on functionality

543
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,640
um

544
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,080
usually if you use a lipo then we have

545
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,760
to do a sandwich board

546
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,240
and i have a slight little bit of ptsd

547
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,440
from those

548
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,919
so uh

549
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,679
so it depends on functionality if you

550
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,520
want to have to keep replacing them

551
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,440
because it's training them or you want

552
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,120
them to be able to just plug them in and

553
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,840
keep them going

554
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,240
yeah so availability is definitely an

555
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,480
issue with that you should with

556
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,559
double a's and aaa's you know if you've

557
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,640
got a thousand or ten thousand defcon

558
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,480
attendees who need new batteries that's

559
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,840
a problem

560
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,640
um

561
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,039
but again with the lipos yeah protection

562
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,480
for them if you can't provide that

563
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,240
protection that's bad

564
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,840
the other thing with lipos is long-term

565
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,080
storage right lots of people like to

566
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,159
keep these in a drawer or in a box or

567
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,919
whatever the batteries swell over time

568
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,640
can be a problem

569
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,880
yeah i think for us

570
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,039
power is always an issue because we

571
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,200
always want things to be

572
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,279
blinky right

573
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,840
and oh i gotta read them

574
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,720
light i'm getting diet not five yeah

575
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,679
but like so actually up here we do have

576
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,279
one with lipos

577
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,279
and for lipos

578
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,360
two of them yeah two of them and so you

579
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,799
can tell that they're encased right um

580
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,880
because again pointy things and so we

581
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,159
didn't want to have fire happening

582
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,120
but the thing about lipos is that we

583
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,000
individ we charge all of these by hand

584
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,799
so

585
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,159
or we have friends and now with you know

586
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,400
not being able to have friends over we

587
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,799
would have to individually charge these

588
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,559
and just monitor for when the light

589
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,960
turns off so we can put the next

590
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,720
take you know that lipo off and put the

591
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,000
next one on

592
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,559
so we've really gone from

593
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,520
that to double a's

594
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,480
because cr2032s while they're very nice

595
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,000
and light also don't give you the bling

596
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,080
you know that you want

597
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,639
essentially

598
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,799
yeah the same thing is the rest of the

599
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,960
group fire is an issue in

600
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,039
uh psa remove the batteries from your

601
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,159
badge if you're gonna hang them on the

602
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,039
wall

603
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,360
even alkaline batteries they will

604
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
they will off gas and all sorts of crazy

605
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,320
stuff

606
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,799
uh so i think recognizing the fact that

607
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,200
people should be taking those hours and

608
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,799
it probably just can be on display for

609
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,360
the long term

610
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,159
yeah and if you're picking a particular

611
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,159
battery technology

612
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,039
um

613
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,440
make sure you triple quadruple check to

614
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,000
make sure digikey's gonna send

615
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,600
the number that you thought you ordered

616
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,840
and not exactly half what you thought

617
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,600
you ordered cause that sucks

618
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
and don't ever put four in a single

619
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,960
badge you will be crucified

620
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,919
um

621
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,240
yeah no more than two

622
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,679
no more

623
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,440
the other thing about lipo batteries as

624
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,520
a whole is an alkaline battery like i

625
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,720
said you got to charge them and things

626
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,640
like that but you need to give people a

627
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,799
means to charge the lipo battery and not

628
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,799
discharge it because that's not fun

629
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,200
either that actually adds a significant

630
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,880
cost to the for battery safety um in

631
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,120
general it adds cost to it

632
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,080
so

633
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,600
there's a little bit

634
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,678
a lot of math going on to it as well

635
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,000
also

636
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,520
shipping

637
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,080
yeah yeah shipping with batteries is not

638
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,240
they don't like it

639
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,640
they're supposed to go my ground

640
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,279
which sucks

641
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,799
all right

642
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,400
clearly a smart topic

643
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:57,120
[Music]

644
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,600
what badge chips are your favorite or

645
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,799
that you currently use

646
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,880
the nordic 52 series

647
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,600
by far my favorite very low power

648
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,760
very capable chips uh and the new ones

649
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,760
now are just getting better so we've

650
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,200
done that i think in two or three

651
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,240
designs

652
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,600
some prototypes you've thrown away but

653
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,399
that's our that's our favorite

654
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,279
uh whenever i'm doing the code on it

655
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,880
there's always a propeller on there

656
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,039
because that's what i use most often but

657
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,440
it's a power hungry little chip so you

658
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,799
know for doing that there's going to be

659
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,120
a lipo on there and as we all just heard

660
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,440
that complicates everything

661
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,799
and i think we all know what peter uses

662
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,720
yep i'm stuck in the pick world i just

663
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,799
go to digi kingdom that's cheap oh that

664
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,039
works

665
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,440
um so

666
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,200
i have a new favorite chip but it's

667
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,120
classified we're still we haven't

668
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,640
released that badge yet

669
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,520
um but i will say anything that has

670
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,120
the ability to be

671
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,919
reflashed over usb without code already

672
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,440
on it is

673
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,679
well worth just do that don't ever do

674
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,080
anything else

675
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,520
i do whatever he tells me to

676
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,679
same thing but peter peter does all my

677
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,760
code and everything so people are like

678
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,440
oh what's that that's a it's got to pick

679
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,440
why because that's what peter does why

680
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,640
does peter do that because that's what

681
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,399
he knows and he programs an assembly

682
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,559
because he's crazy

683
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,080
no that's that's true and everything's

684
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
in the simplicity

685
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,720
yes and just screaming

686
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,799
what's the badge component or feature

687
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,480
that you will never ever ever do again

688
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,440
aside from lipos

689
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,600
sd cards

690
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,158
touch sends

691
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,880
other than having four double a

692
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,039
batteries that's you know

693
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,440
i don't think we'd do that one again but

694
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,480
as far as like badge features hmm

695
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,720
i don't know i mean we'll flock a badge

696
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,679
if it's funny enough

697
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,520
i don't know if you'd call it a feature

698
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,120
but a kit

699
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,039
like a bad kit

700
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,880
it takes longer to miss put the damn kit

701
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,600
together that doesn't build the damn bag

702
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,320
when you magnify that by a hundred that

703
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,799
sucks

704
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,360
okay

705
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,039
uh printing keycaps

706
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,840
key switches keycaps don't do it we

707
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,440
won't do it again we've learned

708
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,279
so i got a question for you what was

709
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,320
your yield on the keycap

710
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,520
um

711
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,360
you're over yeah

712
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,240
it was it was pretty good

713
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,679
like how many

714
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,240
percentage percentage percentage of

715
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,320
successes it was probably less than five

716
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,320
percent were bad oh yeah mine was a 50.

717
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,080
i made 250 to use 125. no

718
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,520
no

719
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,559
your mileage may vary

720
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,320
you know i think actually in that same

721
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,640
grain um

722
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,880
our our disc badge

723
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,120
which is i think is beautiful

724
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,840
but

725
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,840
i got calluses and blisters putting the

726
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,240
mechanism together

727
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,559
i'm

728
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,480
i told them after this was done that we

729
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,080
would never do another mechanical badge

730
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,520
again

731
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,120
but then they came up with an idea and i

732
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,158
was like maybe we'll do that

733
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,440
but with significantly fewer parts

734
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,080
because there are like 40 3d printed

735
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,640
parts on that that had to be sanded and

736
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,080
calibrated

737
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,120
and

738
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,239
adjusted to

739
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,799
create and i

740
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,200
it's a beautiful product but

741
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,799
i i don't think i could do it again

742
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,799
learned our lessons yes we have learned

743
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,039
our lessons

744
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,799
hopefully except for that one badge

745
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,360
all right

746
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,960
uh

747
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,679
do you see many after con code changes

748
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,919
to your badges by you or by third

749
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,480
parties

750
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,480
no not really i think we released one

751
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,720
soft one fix a couple years later on one

752
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,399
of our badges but nothing really

753
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,240
yeah eddie was supposed to test one

754
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,399
badge and she missed

755
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,880
a slight little detail thing but we

756
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,480
managed to

757
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,440
sort of

758
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,159
spin the problem uh the people who found

759
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,840
the bug were like okay we're gonna give

760
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,679
you the patch

761
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,360
and uh you can go out in the community

762
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,919
and disseminate it to uh everyone that

763
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,840
you feel is doing a really good job and

764
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,919
they actually went out and they did that

765
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,000
and then of course we put it online too

766
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,240
so you know sometimes things happen and

767
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,200
just turn it into something good

768
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,360
no

769
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,640
um it's pretty rare that i released more

770
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,799
code after the conference occasionally

771
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,799
there's a little bug that i'll fix

772
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,039
um last year's defcon badge i was really

773
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,279
hoping someone would you know do a pull

774
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,360
request and fix some of the macro pad

775
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,919
code no one ever did so it's still

776
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,919
horrible

777
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,640
yeah normally we're once we're done we

778
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,120
move on to the next batch there's

779
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,200
there's no time to turn rack and be like

780
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,799
uh we should uh

781
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,799
maybe when we're like really old

782
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,559
yeah it's it's really

783
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,799
in my stuff we just kind of release it

784
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,120
you know the completed firmware

785
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,080
um

786
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,320
to be honest i've only had one person

787
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,480
ask for the code and i told them like

788
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,159
i'll be honest with you this badge does

789
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,000
nothing but blink

790
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,600
figure out how to do it on an arduino

791
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,919
it'll actually be better than what this

792
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,679
thing can do we ran that take to the

793
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,679
ground

794
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,320
obviously surface mountain leds were

795
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,399
enabling technologies for batches what

796
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,120
future component or current component

797
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,880
that you would like to see cheaper would

798
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,880
you love to include in a future batch

799
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,120
micro projectors maybe so

800
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,000
our competition is basically sitting up

801
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,480
here and

802
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,039
i don't think you know we're yeah we're

803
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,640
all playing the same games i don't think

804
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,080
we can answer this with each other in

805
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,039
the room ask me later

806
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,240
mechatronics

807
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,520
storage

808
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,639
like like more storage to do because a

809
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,079
lot of stuff that's really neat with

810
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,159
like audio and things like that not

811
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,639
generation of audio but like playing you

812
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,320
know rick ashley and that kind of good

813
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,520
stuff

814
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,079
or slayer um i mean a slayer bag would

815
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,119
be really annoying for people around you

816
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,879
it's awesome for you though

817
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,719
um but that kind of stuff gets kind of

818
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,599
limited by space um and the overall

819
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,599
power there's a lot of things that it's

820
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,560
really

821
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,399
like you can go by

822
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,199
okay let me give you the simplest thing

823
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,000
go

824
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,320
to any gift shop and they've got those

825
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,719
fans that are foam

826
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,280
and it's got a little led strip on it

827
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,119
and you turn it on and it's plays i

828
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,679
don't know captain america or batman or

829
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,800
some thing the amount of work that goes

830
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
into that animation

831
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,359
is immense and they make millions of

832
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,599
them and they sell them for a buck

833
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,560
um

834
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,280
i

835
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,800
i i can't even begin like i've sat and

836
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,160
looked at that product and taken it

837
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,119
apart and you're like how could i

838
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,040
replicate this

839
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,880
and everything i've come up with it'd be

840
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,560
50 dollars

841
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,520
per

842
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,760
stupid fan for me to replicate that

843
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,720
because

844
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,320
there's just there's just some things

845
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,119
that the individual parts are that price

846
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,480
because they're expected to be purchased

847
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
in the quantities of a million

848
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,920
and

849
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,000
we weren't getting like well a lot of

850
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,079
our tips now are mostly from the

851
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,599
mid 2000's for the most part

852
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,119
uh they're just trickling down far

853
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:41,920
enough to where they're actually

854
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,160
affordable for us um yeah definitely

855
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,720
mechanical stuff is a problem

856
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,800
there's also a lot of things that you

857
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,920
can get

858
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,839
that have to be soldered to the board

859
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,119
excuse me so like displays a lot of them

860
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,200
come with a connector that you can't

861
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,880
shove it in an actual connector you have

862
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,960
to solder it to the board and there are

863
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,240
machines that do that and they're really

864
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,560
stupidly expensive and so it's not

865
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,000
really an option to use that kind of

866
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
stuff

867
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,520
with a 3d printed jig and

868
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,119
just you know

869
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,480
crying

870
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,640
a little bit

871
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,359
there's a lot of brute force

872
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,320
and bad thinking yeah uh and volunteers

873
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,079
depending on the group

874
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,520
we're stronger than

875
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,680
it's like an amish barn raising is what

876
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,520
we put it as you know when we get

877
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,920
together to do a badge because our our

878
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,000
hackerspace before you know everything

879
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,960
happened

880
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,880
would come and help us be you know pick

881
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,960
and place machines and

882
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,400

00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,839
yeah

886
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,000
what's the thing that joe used in his

887
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,240
badge

888
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,400
the is it the near field

889
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,400
oh

890
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,040
magnetic near field magnetic something

891
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,040
but it was unobtainium

892
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,880
and but it was very interesting

893
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,440
technology and i like it didn't require

894
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,119
people clicking buttons you know it was

895
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,800
just near field

896
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,000
yeah

897
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,960
yes i think so yeah and

898
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,320
yeah yeah

899
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,839
yeah and i just i thought that was

900
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,599
really interesting tech that

901
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,400
i would easily incorporate into our bed

902
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,920
well i would easily ask him to

903
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,599
incorporate into our badges

904
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,000
you know um if it were cheaper

905
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,680
for accessible okay

906
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,400
all right

907
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,640
oh yep

908
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,200
to kind of expand on that what's your

909
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,040
most and least favorite batch to badge

910
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,330

[Music]

912
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,880
fast

913
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,200
favorite

914
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,200
i'm scared of the fcc so just infrared

915
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,240
yeah honestly that's why we use it so

916
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,760
much is because it's you know not

917
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,560
regulated um and uh it's not interfering

918
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,000
with everyone's cell phone in their

919
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,920
pocket or other devices that they're

920
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,760
playing with for wireless capture the

921
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,920
flag or any of that sort of stuff

922
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,880
whenever you get 400 500 people in a

923
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,359
building all playing with rf it gets

924
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,079
nasty in the spectrum so i like light

925
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,000
for that but i think it would be really

926
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,079
fun to do ultrasonics

927
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,839
for badge to badge that'd be pretty cool

928
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,079
bluetooth is really great uh especially

929
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,079
on those nordic chips i mentioned

930
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,480
least favorite um probably anything sub

931
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,640
gigahertz i really struggled with that

932
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,359
favorite ir because we can solder it

933
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,480
easily

934
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,640
uh when the they're not like minuscule

935
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,760
parts least favorite

936
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,839
i think the one that

937
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:10,450
yes yeah

938
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,160
[Music]

939
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,320
you mean like the connects that we stole

940
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,920
from queer con those

941
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,359
uh

942
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,880
connections i think there were other

943
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,000
kind so we had this dna badge which it

944
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,599
was like one by four pin headers

945
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,640
and

946
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,000
there was two of them that these

947
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,079
individuals had to connect to each other

948
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,400
um and that was just

949
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,079
it just took too it took too long for

950
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,400
people to connect and so they felt like

951
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,800
more and more awkward as they did it

952
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,040
and so that just didn't work out and

953
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,160
to wired point of fear of the fcc which

954
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,440
is valid

955
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,040
um

956
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,800
there was actually an incident at one of

957
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,000
the defcons that was not bad related

958
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,200
but they came the hotel blame badges uh

959
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,599
the nd badges because

960
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,560
one of the badge makers used a chip that

961
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,400
you could

962
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,640
you really wanted to do diop packets

963
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,680
with

964
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,599
that was not what it was for it did not

965
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:12,640
do it

966
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,839
but

967
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,400
that that one little tweet caused a hell

968
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
of a lot of trouble for us for

969
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,920
a day

970
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,800
uh so fear of the van is pretty healthy

971
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,800
sometimes

972
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,560
the vegas people are way scarier than

973
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,880
the man

974
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,359
well i don't know but the queer gone on

975
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,319
the squid yeah that was the coolest i've

976
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,160
ever seen and i'm always like let's do

977
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,520
that and he's like that's not in our

978
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,359
budget and so i don't even know how it

979
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,960
does but it's beautiful

980
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,480
apparently

981
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,720
i'd say least favorite are weird

982
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,118
connectors that you can't get or replace

983
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,720
i am guilty of this i've used them

984
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,000
because of budget and other constraints

985
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,960
but

986
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,319
using connectors that are made for

987
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,160
people to plug and unplug thousands of

988
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,160
times like usb

989
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,240
that's where it's at

990
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,480
yeah i think the ones that we use that

991
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,640
we stole from queer con

992
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,640
or when yeah and

993
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,359
used on the defcon 26 badges i think

994
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,920
technically they were rated for like 36

995
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,359
connects

996
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,319
wow there were way more than 36 connects

997
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,160
and so understandably like there were a

998
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,160
lot that broke off and you know some

999
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,680
that just

1000
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,960
you know coached out afterwards um but

1001
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,880
yeah

1002
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,280
all right so

1003
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,560
uh

1004
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,560
maybe one last question

1005
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,440
well i'll ask this question yeah so

1006
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,599
what brought you into badges and what

1007
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,400
will take you out

1008
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,839
go down the line

1009
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,440
uh what brought me into badges

1010
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,440
originally

1011
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,760
was lost badges

1012
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,480
before i started attending defcon i just

1013
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,160
thought it was really cool to see

1014
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,520
art in an unconventional medium which is

1015
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,000
exactly why i do what i do in fact when

1016
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,319
i got into it what really surprised me

1017
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,000
was the other badge makers approaching

1018
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,319
me asking how i did what i did when i

1019
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,680
thought they were hiding all the secrets

1020
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,880
it turned out it was kind of more of a

1021
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,359
coincidence than anything in some cases

1022
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,960
um what will take me out of it um

1023
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,400
if

1024
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
my daughter says she misses me and i'm

1025
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,480
not seeing her enough

1026
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,800
oh my family is more important than that

1027
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,319
it's not really insanity it's a

1028
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,520
challenge

1029
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,760
because it looks really difficult to do

1030
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,440
and it's a lot of work i mean i'm not

1031
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,520
understanding how much work it is

1032
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,000
but when you have your finished product

1033
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,119
in hand

1034
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,680
for the first time and it works

1035
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,480
the first time it works

1036
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480
that's a really cool feeling

1037
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,839
uh and

1038
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,760
the thing about it's

1039
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,280
everyone's their own worst critic every

1040
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,640
time you look at something you make you

1041
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,319
know every mistake you made on it you

1042
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,000
know everything wrong with it you know

1043
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,880
every

1044
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,720
thing every feature you cut every

1045
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,200
feature that didn't turn out the way

1046
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,800
you'd hoped it did even though it's

1047
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,280
there you you know the whole story but

1048
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,280
the people who acquire it don't know

1049
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,640
that whole story you don't need to know

1050
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,880
that whole story to them it's just

1051
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,119
really goddamn cool

1052
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,240
uh and the they do things with it they

1053
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,079
sometimes they modify it sometimes they

1054
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,240
hang out on the wall one of the coolest

1055
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,480
things about doing this is when someone

1056
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,160
two years later posts a picture of like

1057
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,920
this is my badge collection and you get

1058
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,520
to look at it and see which ones are

1059
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,560
yours

1060
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,880
and and it's that's a really cool

1061
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,760
feeling

1062
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,000
uh it's it is

1063
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,960
it's

1064
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,960
it's really really nice

1065
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,640
that said

1066
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,359
uh i'm sure we all kind of experienced

1067
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,160
it to a level in 2020 i actually was

1068
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,839
supposed to do the deathcon china two

1069
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:58,880
batch

1070
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,319
um

1071
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,319
i got recruited to do that in the middle

1072
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,280
of january to replace another maker uh

1073
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,280
who couldn't do it for uh reasons and um

1074
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,520
we were going full bore on that

1075
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,960
a full scene ahead for a thing that

1076
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,280
needed to be delivered by april uh in

1077
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,520
china and we had to have it

1078
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,640
everything had to be made in china

1079
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,560
everything had to be delivered in china

1080
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,800
and i don't speak chinese

1081
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,520
um so we were

1082
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,119
going going going going going hey what's

1083
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,040
going on with the scope and then going

1084
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,440
going and trying to shut down

1085
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,599
and i hit a wall like literally 100

1086
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,640
miles an hour hit a wall uh and that

1087
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,480
that broke me for

1088
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,440
the

1089
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,440
net tilt now

1090
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,599
i came here to recharge it was it was

1091
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,319
hard so it's when you are going full

1092
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,760
steam you have to stop for something you

1093
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,800
never get so i've seen the start and

1094
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,640
finish and i've seen the start and had

1095
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,880
to stop and you can never go back to it

1096
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,800
that is hurts way more than the finished

1097
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,520
product does now you might get burnout

1098
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,599
and decide not to go back to it

1099
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:02,400
but

1100
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,920
there's always more to burn out than

1101
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,960
just

1102
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,760
the the product

1103
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:32,509

00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,800
