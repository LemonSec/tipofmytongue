[Music]

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,920
okay

4
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,839
oh

5
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,559
what's up guys um

6
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,920
my name is peter thanks for coming to my

7
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,240
talk um this is a script kitty's guide

8
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,560
to easy wins um

9
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,000
this is the first time i've

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,640
presented to um

11
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,799
any large group this is also the first

12
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,880
time i've uh i've talked in front of a

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,960
bunch of hackers so i present this with

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,479
a great amount of humility and um

15
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,560
and

16
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,400
please feel free to ask questions if i

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,280
yard sale and it gets awkward um but

18
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,320
thank you guys for coming and

19
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,159
let's just get to it

20
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,079
so as a heads up this talk is not for

21
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,759
the advanced this is like

22
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,320
i'm i'm a software developer by trade uh

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,320
i just basically work with pandas i'm

24
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,079
i'm very very much a pigeonholed talent

25
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:50,799
but

26
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,240
this is what i've been really excited

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,960
about for like the past 10 months and

28
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,640
i've been putting it into into my

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,040
workflows in professional and personal

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,840
life

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,159
and it's really made an awesome

32
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,040
like change in a lot of things so

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,000
there it is there it is if you're

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,600
looking for buffer overloads or reverse

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,479
engineering this isn't the talk

36
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,959
but basically i'm talking about macros

37
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,520
the things that have

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,400
that are like one shot bits of code

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,040
little little things that do exactly

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,160
only one thing that are recursive or not

41
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,000
recursive not infinite looping no

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,480
decision making this is just like a one

43
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,599
and done

44
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,920
solution for

45
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,920
just any tiny task that you don't want

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,680
to do

47
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,160
and so takeaways i'm looking for is just

48
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,160
a little understanding of what i'm like

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,480
my philosophy on what has made a

50
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,120
difference in my workflows um some

51
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,560
examples of unconventional

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
unconventional script usage for fun and

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
profit

54
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,879
you know the risks and rewards and just

55
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,440
basically an opportunity to run stuff by

56
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,239
me if you like

57
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,280
so a little bit about me i'm a computer

58
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,120
science major i've worked mostly as

59
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,599
business analysts and uh nowadays i do a

60
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,519
lot of stuff with python

61
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,440
airflow pandas

62
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,959
and um

63
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,319
you know if you're a myers-briggs person

64
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,319
i'm an intp so that gives you an idea of

65
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,480
what i'm what i'm about

66
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,239
and and the crux of this talk is

67
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,360
basically

68
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,440
if uh

69
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,280
you know if you're if you're doing

70
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,480
something

71
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,920
and you're just putting all of your

72
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
focus into it you're gonna hit a you're

73
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,920
gonna hit a glass ceiling on how fast

74
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,280
you can do things

75
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
if you're spending some time on your

76
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,640
infrastructure

77
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
you're also going to

78
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,319
you're you're going to be spending a lot

79
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,000
of time at first

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,519
building out

81
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,959
like

82
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,480
spending a lot of time

83
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,280
oh man guys i'm crashing oh okay okay

84
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,040
but basically

85
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,879
if you're building out a lot of tiny

86
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,239
little scripts to improve your workflows

87
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,319
you're uh you're gonna be giving

88
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,239
yourself more space to think on the

89
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,760
bigger picture

90
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,000
that's generally uh

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,840
what i'm chasing after

92
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,239
and and so you know if you're building

93
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,480
out a fast infrastructure you gain speed

94
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,879
over time and you don't necessarily have

95
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,120
a top speed

96
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,478
also i wrote these slides and i

97
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,238
i feel like they're super abstract so if

98
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,600
you want me to dive into something a

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,720
little bit more i'm probably going to

100
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,479
jump around them a little bit

101
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,360
but

102
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,759
uh feel free to like chime in if you

103
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,600
like

104
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,759
so when i'm talking about a macro or a

105
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,600
script i'm not necessarily using formal

106
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,120
terminology

107
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,800
i am

108
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,400
looking for something that basically

109
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,560
just solves a problem pragmatically

110
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,160
something that i can write quickly based

111
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,759
on my knowledge base um

112
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,000
so this like examples are

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,880
like just pasting stuff mouse wiggling

114
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,479
um executing

115
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,560
like obscure bash commands that i don't

116
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,840
necessarily use all the time

117
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,479
and

118
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,840
when i'm looking at these the things

119
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,759
that i'm trying to

120
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,080
consider is

121
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,400
like is it going to be dependable

122
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,800
is it something that is easy to

123
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,759
implement

124
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,759
does it doesn't really provide me value

125
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,880
and

126
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,759
and largely what i'm considering is

127
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,520
you know is it something that i will use

128
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,080
the issue that i run into is you know

129
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,759
you can build something complex you can

130
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,199
build something nice

131
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,759
and if you don't know how to how to call

132
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,160
it well you can't call it reflexively

133
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,800
it's not necessarily helping

134
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,840
keep your focus where you want it

135
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,360
having something that you can call be a

136
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,720
muscle memory

137
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,800
is a thousand times better that's that's

138
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
kind of the

139
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,360
ultimately that's what it's about

140
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,560
yeah

141
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,840
i think i talked about muscle memory

142
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,320
it's basically i'm all about flow state

143
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,759
and i want to make sure that i'm

144
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,199
building things

145
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,840
that are

146
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,880
oh man

147
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,880
is this is this talk to like

148
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,800
with it can you explain what a flow

149
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
state looks like for you yeah yeah okay

150
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,919
awesome thank you um so like flow state

151
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,520
for me is like

152
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,440
being able to be

153
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,919
engaged enough that i don't get bored or

154
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,919
disconnected from my work but at the

155
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,319
same time it's something that

156
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,479
um

157
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,919
it's something that removes the mental

158
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,160
fog from as you can see i'm somebody

159
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,039
that like spaces out hard i like

160
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,600
bifurcate mentally and so if i have

161
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,360
something that allows me to just be like

162
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,880
okay i know that i've got to get this

163
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,199
thing done i just hit the button and it

164
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,479
like sends out the nice email for a

165
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,479
recurring problem that i don't

166
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,560
necessarily have the emotional capacity

167
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,000
to want to address

168
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,520
like flow state for me is being able to

169
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,160
say okay someone asked a pointed

170
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,759
difficult question

171
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,919
i can hit this button it autoresponds

172
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,560
and it responds diplomatically so i

173
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,840
still have the tactical advantage of

174
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
being kind but i also

175
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,080
address the issues premeditatedly

176
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,440
yeah that's a little bit about the

177
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,479
environment you're working in to give

178
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,160
some context like yeah i should be

179
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,000
working at linux yeah okay awesome

180
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,360
question so

181
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,000
where i work is um

182
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,160
i work in in two different

183
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,720
physical machines right one is my just

184
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,319
regular linux machine that i just tool

185
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,720
around on personally and then i have it

186
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,039
connected to a kvm to a

187
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,160
windows box that has

188
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,280
wsl2 and then some containers for you

189
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,199
know different linux environments for

190
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,639
airflow

191
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,479
so

192
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,400
so i want to talk a little bit about you

193
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,440
know what let's just jump into the

194
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,199
hardware then so i can tell you like how

195
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,520
i how i call these macros right

196
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,400
so because my my work computer is

197
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,120
is a windows machine i use auto hotkey a

198
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,919
lot

199
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,759
and yeah you know of course if you want

200
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,879
to put these things into play you

201
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,479
probably want like admin access to your

202
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,120
computer but um

203
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,039
but autohotkey are you who's familiar

204
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,400
with this have you guys

205
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,199
alright

206
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,280
good good so i think it was originally

207
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,400
made for um for cheating in multiplayer

208
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,280
games online and it just leverages the

209
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,759
net framework and you can basically

210
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,479
say i want to set up control f9 to like

211
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,000
button mash you know

212
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
turn 180 degrees and like headshot

213
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,199
somebody with a shotgun or something

214
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,759
like that um but it's really useful in a

215
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,599
work environment so

216
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,599
like in this in this picture here can

217
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,440
you guys see my mouse i don't know

218
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,719
um okay cool

219
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,958
so like f10 right now like i just have

220
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,799
that set up so that i just i think it

221
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,958
opens an rdp instance this is for my my

222
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,839
uh a former setup

223
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,839
but

224
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,440
it's really nice being able to say you

225
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,640
know i

226
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,160
you know coming back to the flow state

227
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,040
question

228
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,399
how do i jump between apps like how do i

229
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,000
make sure that i'm moving at the speed

230
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,360
of thought and i don't want to just like

231
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,839
hit alt tab like did i use that last or

232
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,600
did i have to like step through like

233
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,320
seven documents back i can hit ctrl f2

234
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,800
and then pops open outlook or f6 that

235
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,959
builds an appointment and outlook f9

236
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,600
opens notepad plus plus um so being able

237
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,320
to switch apps when my mind is

238
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,839
in the attention space that it needs to

239
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,760
be before i find myself staring at

240
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,200
chrome and being like why am i looking

241
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,279
at this like stack overflow page from

242
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,560
two days ago

243
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,560
um

244
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,279
that's kind of what i'm uh what i'm

245
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,080
shooting for with auto hotkey um along

246
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,120
with that

247
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,880
i i have this thing called the ducky pad

248
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,040
has anyone heard of this thing

249
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,279
okay okay okay this thing's on tindy it

250
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,160
sells

251
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,360
you can you can build it yourself it's

252
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,640
all open source

253
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,440
but it's it's basically a macro pad

254
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,760
but what it does is you can see it's got

255
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,680
like two itty bitty buttons underneath

256
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,560
the oled and you can page through

257
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,279
15 pages of ducky script macros that are

258
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,959
like rubber ducky written

259
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,160
so

260
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,959
um you can have something that will

261
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,040
like what's a good example like you know

262
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,480
you've got you've got one that's like

263
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,240
for your media when you're in meetings

264
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,920
and you can say like okay this button's

265
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,000
just gonna hang up teams call this one's

266
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,360
gonna mute this one's gonna turn off

267
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,240
video or you can have it where it types

268
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,920
out something like

269
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,240
yo what's going on uh can you push this

270
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,560
to prod for me and because it is

271
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,560
leveraging just the i o you don't have

272
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,040
to like configure anything like that

273
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,120
it's literally just like

274
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,440
ducky scripts um

275
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,079
to to control either computer the reason

276
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,079
i mention that with the with regards to

277
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,120
the environment that you were talking

278
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,959
about is because

279
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,360
if you've got two computers that you're

280
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,959
bouncing between

281
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,680
if you build a script

282
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,560
robustly you can have it so that if you

283
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,959
hit a kbm switch you just you know

284
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,360
switch it from one computer that's

285
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,399
windows and one computer that's linux

286
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,160
and uh

287
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,000
if you've built something that is

288
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,120
that works ambivalently then then you're

289
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,560
set up for success for a broad use

290
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,040
script

291
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,880
let's see yeah i use bash aliases um

292
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,120
because my my personal

293
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,040
environment is linux and my work

294
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,440
environment has wsl2 in it i've got

295
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,040
linux in there as well

296
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,200
and and a note on a note on autohotkey

297
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,720
while i'm thinking about the environment

298
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,120
as a whole what's really cool about

299
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,360
having containerized linux is that if

300
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,000
you use autohotkey and then you have

301
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,120
like a

302
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,800
command like i've got one that's like

303
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,839
you type uvub and it will navigate

304
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,440
automatically to the path where um

305
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,800
where your windows environment is so

306
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,519
slash mount c whatever

307
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,839
and really handy if you're dropping in

308
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,079
like archived files from sharepoint

309
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,079
saving them on your downloads file but

310
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,920
then you need to reference them with

311
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,160
respect to a container

312
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,399
you just type like cd uv and then just

313
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,200
type in your file name

314
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,800
so that's kind of that's the hardware

315
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,839
i'm basically hardware software

316
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,320
the the resources i use for for this

317
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,600
stuff

318
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,839
so

319
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,600
examples um this is a super simple one

320
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,800
but

321
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,720
often times i'll get a text message from

322
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,160
my wife and she'll be like hey what are

323
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,839
the balances on all our accounts and to

324
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,440
start no i'm not like having the same

325
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,120
auto sign in to

326
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,800
bank or anything like that i'm not i'm

327
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,480
not building automated postage notes

328
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,839
that automatically own me um but what i

329
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,680
am doing is i'll have it read down the

330
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,800
line items of all of the aliases of the

331
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,320
bank accounts

332
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,120
so it'll say something like okay this is

333
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,959
uncle john's savings account this is our

334
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,800
pet dogs uh hsa etc and

335
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,480
you know then i can just

336
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,040
look at the at the screen of the browser

337
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,920
for the the balances and then another

338
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,639
screen that has like i don't know my my

339
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,519
android text message web portal right

340
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,160
and i can just type in like negative 600

341
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,079
you know negative 22 000 for balances

342
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,399
and uh

343
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,160
it's really it's it's useful just

344
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,320
because then you don't have to like

345
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,720
you know straddle straddle uh

346
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,440
account names versus numbers

347
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,800
something that i use all the time is

348
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,120
file name governance so this is an auto

349
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
hotkey script that i built but basically

350
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,120
if i just type date ff

351
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,800
it basically

352
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,440
starts up a file name that i'm building

353
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,519
with a month month underscore date date

354
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,560
underscore year underscore prefix so i

355
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,279
used to name my files like you know

356
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,360
uh python program underscore new

357
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
underscore new for real underscore new

358
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,639
for real

359
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,160
but broken

360
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,120
and

361
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,839
uh and that sucked but now if i type

362
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,880
like date ff uh client name for an

363
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,600
archive file then i can reference that

364
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,720
immediately by saying like cd ueuv

365
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,440
uh

366
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,360
date ff tab and then type in the client

367
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,639
number like i'm on the most current data

368
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,959
that i'm that i'm managing and if i

369
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,199
like if my downloads file which builds

370
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,600
up or my downloads folder builds up with

371
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,320
a ton of files i can still find what i'm

372
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,720
looking for and grab the hottest hottest

373
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,839
stuff

374
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,240
question so far is this making sense

375
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,120
hell yeah all right um

376
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,440
yeah bonuses uh if you guys use airflow

377
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
sometimes you need to like do a unit

378
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,839
test in airflow and you want to like

379
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,519
call yesterday's date you know just have

380
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,560
date yy or date date dd for

381
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,639
you know writing these things in a nice

382
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,199
human way

383
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,800
have you guys heard of the term

384
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,880
propinquity

385
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,000
okay propiquity is a weird thing it's uh

386
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,460
the

387
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,600
[Music]

388
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,399
the unconscious or subconscious

389
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,240
likelihood of using something because of

390
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,120
its spatial relationship to you so if

391
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,279
something has high propinquity it is in

392
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,000
a location that is where it will be

393
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,120
utilized often versus low propane video

394
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,399
or something you don't even know it

395
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,839
exists or you've forgotten that it's

396
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,720
that it still exists

397
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,240
and

398
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,959
when it comes to how i try yeah your

399
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,720
microphone cut out

400
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,199
let's see oh i flipped the switch my bad

401
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,720
all right thank you yeah thanks thanks

402
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,920
for the heads up um i got you back

403
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,440
hey were you guys able to hear me was i

404
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,120
projecting okay all right all right good

405
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,240
job

406
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,720
okay so um

407
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,560
when i consider propinquity i'm also

408
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,399
considering propinquity in the ducky pad

409
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,079
so this what you're seeing here is a

410
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,800
picture of the user interface for

411
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,320
putting your ducky scripts and like

412
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,279
labeling them and coloring the ducky pad

413
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,279
and what i'm doing here is everything

414
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,079
with a g underscore is a relationship to

415
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,440
um

416
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,959
like get so

417
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,440
all of these are get related commands

418
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,000
that get called based on

419
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,480
where they are so i have an idea of the

420
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,240
ideal or the default sequence that i

421
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,160
step through so like get fetches like

422
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,040
get fat get fetch get pull all in one

423
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,160
macro versus git status get commit get

424
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,199
pushed get out um but then you also have

425
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,959
something weird like get data which is

426
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,079
just like an aux said mix up that allows

427
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,560
me to copy and paste my git commit

428
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,440
reasons it like does a tree on the repo

429
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,000
and then it puts it in my clipboard well

430
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,199
okay no it doesn't put it in my

431
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,079
clipboard it it just calls that and then

432
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,480
i snag it you know just copy it put it

433
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,399
in my clipboard and then i call push to

434
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,440
prod and then it writes to you know hey

435
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,880
joe hey bob

436
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,560
uh here's what i'm intending to push

437
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,240
today all the little parameters that i

438
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,160
have and then it pastes in the directory

439
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,399
that i just changed so everyone can see

440
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,000
what i'm talking about the context is

441
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,959
all there

442
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,120
and what's nice about this is that like

443
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,399
you know i'm thinking about it and i'm

444
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,160
thinking okay i've pushed my code

445
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,639
through and now i just like click one

446
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,040
two three four five six and as every as

447
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,279
i'm watching it do that i can lean on my

448
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,120
subconsciousness it's like driving a car

449
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,800
and not trying to

450
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,639
solve the long division problem that my

451
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,079
teacher gave me in second grade um

452
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,199
so so i really like that and uh

453
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,199
like d email that

454
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,760
after i've like called push to prod it

455
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,839
builds out the email and then i can hit

456
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,160
this button optionally and it will

457
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,000
basically tab through outlook because i

458
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,439
don't want to look at the uis i don't

459
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,439
want to like spend my prefrontal cortex

460
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,319
ram like looking at an application this

461
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,959
just does the tab work steps through and

462
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,880
then sets the delay email to 8 am

463
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,480
because i'm an early worker that way

464
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,679
like nobody's doing like a uh

465
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,760
you know uh uh like

466
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,120
something needs to be pushed but it's

467
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
like not important so i don't want to

468
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,639
wake anybody up at like 3am

469
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,960
um

470
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,919
this is the meat and potato of easy win

471
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,360
for me because this was um

472
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,039
i decided to just automate all my

473
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,840
responses to recruiters so i was looking

474
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,760
i was entertaining new offers

475
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,480
and

476
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,160
the moment i did in the middle of like

477
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,559
returning to office season

478
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,840
uh i got like 17 recruiters like i'm not

479
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,960
i'm not a talented guy but uh i had like

480
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,559
17 recruiters reaching out to me all the

481
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,360
time

482
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,840
and

483
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,000
so i decided to make a sliding scale of

484
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,240
responses right so i would have one that

485
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,760
was like okay if someone offered me a

486
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,000
job where it's like fully remote two-day

487
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,440
work week and you know it allows you to

488
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,480
it's

489
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,559
yeah it's great then i can have a button

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,280
the problems that these guys are solving

493
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,799
here's my resume here's my phone number

494

like new job offers that like if i just

503
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,440
went to the interview it would like bump

504
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
me up 20k which it did and i'm thankful

505
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,440
for that um

506
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,679
but uh

507
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,200
but being able to take the

508
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,120
procrastination and the

509
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,520
the the fear and the the cognitive

510
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
dissonance about reaching for something

511
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,679
that you know is strategically valuable

512
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,039
and just putting it into a button so you

513
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,799
don't have to think about it

514
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,919
um

515
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,320
i love that and then also you know for

516
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,919
for just removing the the chaff uh

517
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,840
you know you've got i only want remote

518
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,880
gigs or i only want python gigs or uh

519
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,360
jobs of the with a linux unix stack or

520
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,880
just i'm good

521
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,640
i'll reach into my network and see if i

522
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,880
can find somebody whose skills merit

523
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,320
that position

524
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,039
and and so yeah ultimately this allows

525
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,880
you to just step through the things that

526
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,200
you want and it's not necessarily about

527
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,120
just getting a job you can now cherry

528
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,120
pick among all the options and not leave

529
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,480
anything on the table because you're

530
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,679
just wanting to whine

531
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,760
making sense everybody good

532
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,120
cool

533
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,360
works for social maintenance too so

534
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,679
i'm somebody that like totally lets my

535
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,120
friendships degrade like the bridge of

536
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,160
the picture

537
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,200
and

538
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
like i'll just get tunnel vision on the

539
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
things that i'm focused on

540
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,440
so now what i can do is i can build

541
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,039
something that will say

542
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,760
um using like shift enter so i can type

543
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,799
it out in like an sms web portal or in

544
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,840
uh in linkedin or email just say this is

545
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
like jordan harbinger just saying like

546
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,720
hey guys hope this finds well um i'd

547
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,080
love to hear what you're working on no

548
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,080
rush on on a response but

549
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,600
hope you're doing well cheers peter

550
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,640
hayes

551
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,720
and it's been awesome because i've

552
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,480
reconnected with super old friends that

553
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,559
i haven't talked to in ages

554
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,440
um

555
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,880
and it's just been enriching the

556
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,640
experience

557
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,880
um because i've automated

558
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,840
i've increased the propity of uh of

559
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,200
reaching out to my friends and at the

560
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,640
same time it's like i said it and forget

561
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,240
it but then when i get a response you

562
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,600
know i'm i'm there for real

563
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,559
um risks passwords don't do it

564
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,960
i have to put that there just because

565
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,080
i don't need to address it but i do um

566
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,840
of course you've got the the

567
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,240
consideration of calling a script in the

568
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,640
wrong spot right so

569
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,400
if you have like let's go back to that

570
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,280
ducky pad picture

571
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,520
so you can you can set the pages for

572
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,120
this thing right and if you're on

573
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,039
something like

574
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,840
uh push to prod right when you mean to

575
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,600
mute the

576
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,760
mute microsoft teams

577
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
then you might do something

578
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,799
five minutes oh snap i'm sorry guys i

579
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,480
this is we're burning through this okay

580
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,080
yeah you can you can call a script in

581
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,919
the wrong spot just be judicious with

582
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,760
when you call your scripts

583
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,080
um but the rewards are pretty awesome if

584
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,840
you standardize

585
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,200
your your scripts you built them

586
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
premeditatedly you know that you're

587
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,840
gonna have a

588
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,919
succinct accurate flight checklist of

589
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,120
the things that you want to say to

590
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,520
somebody

591
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,559
also if it is premeditative you've got

592
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,400
diplomatic responses to things that you

593
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,559
necessarily don't necessarily want to be

594
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,280
diplomatic about sometimes

595
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,200
and then of course obscure bash command

596
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,760
flags so

597
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,280
you know if you if you have something

598
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,880
weird where you're using pandoc and you

599
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,640
don't use it often but you want to take

600
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,480
your markdown files and convert them

601
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,320
into pdfs you don't remember how to do

602
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,280
that you can just like macro that

603
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,159
um

604
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,520
i also like the fact that it's speed

605
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,200
with supervision

606
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,080
so if it is a one shot thing you know

607
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,520
you're not going to be building nearby

608
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,000
botnet where it like recurses and like

609
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,760
goes non-linear and like all sudden you

610
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,120
own all the

611
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
you know

612
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,559
security cameras in france

613
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,559
it's only gonna it has a start it has an

614
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,240
end it doesn't propagate it doesn't loop

615
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,440
or recurse

616
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,679
and if you've got something like that

617
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,039
then

618
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,720
you have a supervision so that it's not

619
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,600
propagating outside of your scope

620
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,840
but really the the cherry on top is the

621
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,840
instance of flex or the reflexive

622
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,199
instantiation of

623
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,960
getting getting stuff done if you if you

624
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
pull the wine out of it you just find

625
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,840
yourself doing things

626
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,919
so i was going to put up a github of all

627
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,520
my stuff i

628
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,440
um i didn't yet

629
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,039
but hit me up on linkedin if you like

630
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,360
otherwise um i'll put up the github and

631
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,440
if you add me on friendster or whatever

632
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,520
this is uh

633
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,080
i'll hook you up

634
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,360
so

635
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,679
thank you guys for listening to me and

636
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,919
if you've got questions i'm i'm all ears

637
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,480
for them now or otherwise i'll uh i'll

638
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,559
walk off stage

639
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,360
yeah what is your last name

640
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,880
eft

641
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,600
oh yeah here i'll pop that back up

642
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,400
yes

643
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,159
so it seemed like you might have had a

644
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,919
lot of scripts like fire and forget do

645
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,679
you have any of where it just fires up

646
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,720
and then you can

647
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,840
do like this

648
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,200
before you send it

649
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,919
yes yeah for many of them i do um let me

650
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,640
see if i've got an example

651
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,919
not a perfect example but for git commit

652
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:54,720
right

653
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,039
when i'll call git commit it will ask

654
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,120
for like a commit reason so i'll have to

655
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,320
type it all out into into terminal

656
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,919
and then just have like comments go here

657
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,480
between the quotes and not hit enter

658
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,120
and so then i just backspace out of that

659
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,440
and write down what i want same with

660
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,760
this uh this g data which is doing an

661
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,799
aux set pwd combo

662
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,960
it it basically treats the current

663
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
directory and then at the bottom echoes

664
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,799
what i'm writing about the

665
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,200
the current commit repository

666
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,120
and so yeah i just leave that space open

667
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,960
as well to type in what i want and then

668
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,000
yeah i just get the result

669
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,960
how do you balance out when the cost of

670
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,039
automation might exceed the cost of the

671
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,080
manual

672
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,320
that's a great question always always

673
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,000
trade your penny for a nickel never

674
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,919
never in reverse

675
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,919
so yeah most of these things and and

676
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,520
that's the cool

677
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,000
thing about it as well is that it gets

678
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,919
you have a second order effect right if

679
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,640
you're if you've got a pipeline for i

680
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,400
know that i'm going to be building a

681
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,559
macro that's a one shot

682
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,279
and you built that meta infrastructure

683
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,720
then that speed is going to increase

684
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,480
over time as well

685
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,279
so

686
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,360
if you lean on especially if you lean on

687
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,960
the tools that you know

688
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,360
and i'm not saying don't don't research

689
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,320
but

690
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,400
you know adopt more as

691
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,120
you get what i'm saying

692
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,200
okay thank you guys i really appreciate

693
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,600
good

694
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:04,390
