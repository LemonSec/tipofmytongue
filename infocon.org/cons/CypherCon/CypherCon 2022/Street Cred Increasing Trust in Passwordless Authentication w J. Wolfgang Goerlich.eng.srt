[Music]

3
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,960
oh

4
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,360
hey how's it going great great yay

5
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,600
so i'm excited for so many reasons about

6
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,119
cyprecon uh a stage is nice a microphone

7
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,080
is nice you all are great this is this

8
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,600
is fantastic

9
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,799
another thing

10
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,040
that has never happened to me before

11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,759
um is is being invited to give two talks

12
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,119
back to back so

13
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,400
hopefully

14
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,560
you guys will survive this and not be

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,439
bored

16
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,960
um this is really this is really

17
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,560
exciting to me because

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,159
uh i've often times talked about these

19
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,680
talks as being two sides of the same

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,119
coin the first one being street cred

21
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,799
which we're going to talk about uh how

22
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,079
to protect credentials and how to

23
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,880
protect the front end of authentication

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
and where that's going and the second

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,720
part is mistaken identity which is okay

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,040
now that you've protected those creds

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,640
what type of mistakes are your

28
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,240
developers probably making that

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,079
undermines everything they talk about in

30
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,600
hour one

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,159
so that's it double header i actually do

32
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,680
a workshop on this which is which is

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,640
pretty fun

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,119
but uh all right so

35
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,719
go with me back in time just a little

36
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,600
bit

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,320
go with me back in time to uh to like

38
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,720
the dawn of hacking right before there's

39
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,639
the cool music before there's the kill

40
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,440
murals before there's conferences the

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,360
dawn of hacking when the term hacker

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,400
first

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,920
was defined you guys remember anyone

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,360
want to shout out where it was anyone

45
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,959
know

46
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,120
93.

47
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,720
oh mit yes as i said 93 i'm like oh my

48
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,040
god

49
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,720
it was 93.

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,680
i remember the dial-up sounds very well

51
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,480
yes mit mit so

52
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,000
this was the computer

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,800
the ibm

54
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,519
7094

55
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,800
a glorious piece of machinery

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,280
it was it was truly byod and that the

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,720
university brought it and that's all you

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,480
got

59
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,560
it was

60
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,640
very famous for two reasons one i'll

61
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,879
tell you about halfway through this talk

62
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,040
but the first reason this was famous was

63
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,120
because this was the very first computer

64
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,640
the ibm 1794 in the mit the late 50s

65
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,879
early 60s where the term hacker was

66
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,200
defined the first computer to have a

67
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,640
password

68
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
that's exciting right yeah

69
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,080
yeah we're going to share a secret with

70
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,239
the machine people loved it just like

71
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,280
our user loved passwords which is why

72
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,040
footnote this is the machine that had

73
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,200
the very first password breach

74
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,560
at mit

75
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,400
in the 60s when somehow miraculously

76
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,319
surprisingly we don't really know how

77
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,400
lost time someone put all the passwords

78
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,519
on the message of the day file and

79
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,200
printed them out

80
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,280
no one likes passwords

81
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,920
but it started it started this really

82
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,319
interesting cat and mouse right

83
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,000
what do we do we do manned more of the

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,319
the human do we have them like remember

85
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,799
a password and it's you know for this

86
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,319
university system and hopefully they

87
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,480
remember it and they share it or rather

88
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,400
they don't share or do we ask more from

89
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
the machine

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,080
do we ask more for computational maybe

91
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,840
protect it maybe don't store it in the

92
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,519
clear maybe don't accidentally or

93
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,519
intentionally mess it up with the

94
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,760
message of the day file we've had this

95
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,120
back and forth

96
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,080
for 60 years

97
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,159
six decades six decades we've been

98
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,600
fighting this we get better algorithms

99
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,079
the criminals break the agreements we

100
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,160
ask for better lengths and passwords

101
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,000
people write it down this is like given

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,759
up i had a

103
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,120
call and they're like wolf tell me what

104
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,639
the latest advice from this is how long

105
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,759
should we make our password something

106
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,440
like this this is giving up eight

107
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,080
characters that's it if you ask anymore

108
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,960
and people are gonna repel like but wait

109
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,120
in eight characters if we use land man

110
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,880
we can get that right away yes yeah you

111
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,280
can and even if we don't use landman if

112
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,080
it's like ntlmv2 we can like crack it in

113
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,320
like a day yes yes you can so why

114
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,680
characters because we've given up

115
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,160
i'm sorry

116
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,080
tell your people 16 characters and when

117
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,919
you you're updating your resume come

118
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,280
find me because my employer is hiring

119
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,600
um oh i should mention that by the way

120
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,440
hi i'm wolfgang i started talking

121
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,199
without even introducing myself

122
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,400
i am an advisor at cso i work with cisco

123
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,680
secure

124
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,680
came out of dual security so i spent a

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,919
lot of time thinking about multi-factor

126
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,199
and thinking about identity and access

127
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,120
management and all those sort of things

128
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,520
and so i want to talk today about where

129
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,360
we are on this journey

130
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,000
as we've battled for six decades

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,800
to

132
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,560
somehow secure a password to figure out

133
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,240
the right balance between demanding more

134
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,840
of the user i'm demanding more of the

135
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,880
machine

136
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,039
and i'm going to talk about how that may

137
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,639
be translated past or less which i'm

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,639
very excited about i'll touch on risk

139
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,280
based off which i think is absolutely

140
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,240
needed

141
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,720
um and you know we'll talk about how

142
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,240
great it is to get a saml assertion or

143
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,560
you know oidc jot

144
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,320
and we'll all go yeah that sounds great

145
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,680
and then you guys can come back at six

146
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,520
o'clock it'll say and then we steal

147
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,840
those jots

148
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,680
and everything is terrible

149
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,479
all right

150
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,160
multi-factor

151
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,840
multi-factor right mount defector is

152
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,560
good we have the password and uh and

153
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
passwords are cool right i mean i i

154
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,479
don't know i've got like a nostalgia

155
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,319
about passwords 1993 is what i thought

156
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,000
someone said which is right about the

157
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,440
time i created my first password right

158
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,840
you log in you're excited your parents

159
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,440
say you can create an account i'm like

160
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,639
yes

161
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,479
i will name that account they're like

162
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,240
yeah but not that name that's what are

163
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,319
you 10 i'm like yeah probably all right

164
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,240
no different name but you can create a

165
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,840
password you create this password this

166
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
really awesome password that's a shared

167
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,199
secret between you and the machine no

168
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,400
one else knows it but you and the

169
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,880
machine it defines your identity it is

170
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,400
amazing

171
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
and then you have to create like

172
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,400
20 more and 30 more and

173
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,160
then it sucks and then they totally have

174
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,400
to rotate it which this has also given

175
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,479
up on congratulations guys

176
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,080
characters don't rotate it it's fine

177
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,840
it's cool no one's going to mess with

178
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,000
that

179
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,199
so

180
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,720
this has been a problem for a long time

181
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,280
we know as human beings human beings are

182
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,720
storytellers

183
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,919
we are poets we are artists we are

184
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,400
stupid and we create passwords everyone

185
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,960
can guess they were cracking the bsd

186
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,319
passwords like the original like the

187
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,240
smartest people that i know right like

188
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,560
ken thompson and eric schmidt and these

189
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,160
geniuses of our world they're cracking

190
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,680
their passwords recently this is from

191
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,800
the 80s

192
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,639
i like this one this is uh ken

193
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,840
thompson's

194
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,080
it's a chess move i think that's clever

195
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,800
of course no one knew he liked chaps

196
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,880
i'm sure no one guessed that another one

197
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,639
is my favorite is eric's it says it's

198
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,840
his wife's name it's wendy that's cute

199
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,919
it's got three exclamation marks which

200
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,720
is secure right special characters he

201
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,160
was ahead of the time

202
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,000
so we've been doing this for a long time

203
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,919
we pick passwords that are very easy to

204
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:44,720
guess

205
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,000
and a lot of people are like oh yeah

206
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,759
sticky notes sticky notes comes up a lot

207
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,880
of times when i'm talking about this

208
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,960
people like oh yeah that's sticky notes

209
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,160
like when was the last time you saw a

210
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,720
sticky note

211
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,360
but it happens i'm like yeah

212
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,280
in 1993 when we had one or two passwords

213
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,800
no one has a wall of 500 sticky notes

214
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,400
so we write them down and we misplace

215
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,840
them everything so the solution of

216
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,960
course is

217
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,840
multi-factor yes

218
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,319
yes we will take this terrible thing

219
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,680
which might be pretty good if you have

220
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,120
an exclamation mark

221
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,240
and we'll add some strong factor to it

222
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,280
awesome great

223
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,520
but then and this by the way was was

224
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,199
predicted like anyone if you talk to

225
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,960
anyone like five years ago six years ago

226
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,719
um if you ran to alyssa miller she'd be

227
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,159
like defects are going to be terrible

228
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,159
and be like yes you're right if you talk

229
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,360
to someone about passwords they're like

230
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,440
yeah once once there was a multi-factor

231
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,000
they're gonna hack it like no

232
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,680
i figured the bad guys would quit

233
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,519
they're like no they're gonna attack and

234
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,040
that's what we're seeing right sim swap

235
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,920
attacks especially cool if you've got

236
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,080
millions of dollars of cryptocurrency or

237
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,440
nft just let me know what your phone

238
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,800
number is it's fine

239
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,560
um you walk in and there's actually like

240
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,000
salt lawsuits about this which i think

241
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,680
is great you walk into the store you say

242
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,760
hi you know i'm the person who i'm

243
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,240
stealing this com from my phone got

244
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,920
broke and they're like oh man that sucks

245
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,080
i'm so sorry like yeah it really does

246
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,760
can you give me a sim card like yeah bro

247
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,680
okay and then you steal their crypto

248
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,880
worm awesome awesome or any other sort

249
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,680
of swim swap attack ss7s are pretty cool

250
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,519
i was um circle city county and would go

251
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,360
to circle city county and then i was

252
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,920
yeah fun time fun time i took my wife

253
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,680
there when we were first dating and

254
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,800
we're out to

255
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,440
get coffee in the hotel lobby and she's

256
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,959
like why is my phone weird and i pull up

257
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,720
my phone and go oh yeah it's

258
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,640
that's shanghai time

259
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,959
that's that's probably not normal and i

260
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,680
look at the phone it's like oh yeah lte

261
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,839
i said turn your phone off she goes why

262
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,160
just trust me apparently we're in china

263
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
now i don't know we're with hackers

264
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,959
that's what hackers do we change the the

265
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,760
you know tower and everything's fine

266
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,360
and uh and surprisingly she still

267
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
married me i don't know

268
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,240
i would have thought that would have

269
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,080
been a clue but yeah so you you

270
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,760
compromise this tower which isn't hard

271
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,240
to do and then you do an ss7 attack and

272
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,040
then you get the token awesome um submit

273
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,279
your crypto easy to break duplicate code

274
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,839
generation well that's bad i still have

275
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,160
people i don't know why this happens i

276
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,560
still people go and this i swear to you

277
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,800
two weeks ago before this

278
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,720
and if you see this on the recording i'm

279
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,800
sorry i'm talking about you but i am

280
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
talking about you

281
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,079
they're like hey i've got this great

282
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,319
idea i'm gonna roll my own mfa

283
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,200
why because it'll be cheaper and easier

284
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,720
yes

285
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,959
it it will

286
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,959
until you're compromised

287
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,040
but okay anyways so duplicate code

288
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,480
especially prevalent in people who are

289
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,320
rolling their own uh golden salmon

290
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,680
attacks which i will not talk about this

291
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,360
because that's a spoiler for earlier or

292
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,480
later

293
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,079
uh push fishing

294
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,000
or now called brute force

295
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,200
push i think

296
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,240
just especially fun i'm gonna set a push

297
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,160
and uh and this is what one of the

298
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,920
attacks that was described it was one

299
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,240
less something like this person

300
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,800
privileged user should have known better

301
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,079
um had their email account compromised

302
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,560
the password compromised and it kept

303
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,320
getting pushing push attacks saying oh

304
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,720
that's not me not me not me and it just

305
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,920
kept sending him and setting when

306
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,120
setting and sending and sending the

307
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,800
person goes well it's probably me click

308
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,120
okay adversaries in ran a bunch of

309
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,240
scripts uh backdoored his email address

310
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,680
uses email addresses to send a bunch of

311
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,600
other emails to other people including

312
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,279
one with ransomware and then some clicks

313
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,240
it and then spreading throughout the

314
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,600
local subnet i think the entire thing

315
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,079
was like 15 minutes after we clicked yes

316
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,320
meanwhile your stock slash what

317
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,000
8 hours 16 hours 200 days verizon says

318
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,040
anyways

319
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,240
maybe your stock isn't going to catch

320
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,200
that

321
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,920
so that's happening uh evil engine x is

322
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,680
happening where you're thinking you're

323
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,959
logging into account but you're really

324
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,880
logging into something else all sorts of

325
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,200
different ways to go on to things so

326
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,760
you're like okay that's cool

327
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,600
depressed me wolf and i'm saying i'm

328
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,839
sorry i'm sorry but it gets worse

329
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,200
because you may be thinking okay that's

330
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,040
all that's all fine and good

331
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,880
we'll just have everyone use biometrics

332
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,079
yeah

333
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,320
did you guys catch the talos blog where

334
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,720
they 3d printed people's fingerprints

335
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,880
and logged into all the phones

336
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,839
that was cool

337
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,200
so

338
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,959
things are happening things are

339
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,560
happening and one of the questions i get

340
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,240
asked all the time is are these things

341
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,959
possible yeah they're possible i mean if

342
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,560
if you're in cyprus county or circle

343
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,760
city someone's going to mess with the

344
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,720
tower

345
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,639
if you've got a whole bunch of money and

346
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,920
they know your phone number they're

347
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,480
going to sim swap attack you if you got

348
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,519
biometrics they might try and 3d print

349
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,399
them yeah yeah but is it likely no no

350
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,480
thankfully for most of us

351
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,279
i don't worry about it i don't know

352
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,200
about you guys i still have and i hate

353
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,040
to say this in this audience but i still

354
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,800
have sms i'm gonna pay for some things

355
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
why not it's easy and for low risk

356
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,320
accounts sure sure

357
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,040
so is it is it gonna happen

358
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,440
soon but probably not now

359
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,040
but this all gets us into thinking about

360
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,560
passiveness right so if you think about

361
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,480
that entire line

362
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,880
of everything going wrong the still the

363
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,720
most terrible part of it is that shared

364
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,240
secret that we're all

365
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,720
coming up with that's probably our pet

366
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,800
name or our wife's name with exclamation

367
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,079
marks

368
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,680
so the whole trick about pastoralists is

369
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,600
to remove that shared secret to get rid

370
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,680
of that shared secret and to move on to

371
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,040
one of those other factors hopefully

372
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,880
multiple factors

373
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,399
why now

374
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,519
why now

375
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,320
um in

376
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,920
early 2000s bill gates stood on the rsa

377
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
stage and he said we will kill the

378
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,399
password in two years

379
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,399
and it sounded really cool

380
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,519
and in 2020 at rsa the last rsa is that

381
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,800
i stood in a

382
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,440
not on the main stage uh in a side room

383
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,519
with some reporters and i said with web

384
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,959
authent coming out which i'll talk about

385
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,800
in just a minute with web authentic we

386
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,440
will kill the password in two years

387
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,880
yeah

388
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,560
gates was wrong i was wrong you're

389
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,600
probably like why are you comparing

390
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,360
yourself to gates

391
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,760
not my first time when i dropped out of

392
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,680
school i told my mom but mom bill gates

393
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,320
did it and built his entire company and

394
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,519
she's like

395
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,399
but son you're at community college

396
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,399
and your company is systems integrator

397
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,360
so

398
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,880
uh maybe a little bit of hype but we've

399
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,079
been talking about killing passwords for

400
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,199
a very long time and haven't gotten

401
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,560
anywhere one of the reasons we haven't

402
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,920
got anywhere is because we didn't

403
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,680
necessarily have good sensors right it's

404
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,360
very expensive and we'll come back to

405
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
this is one of the the big sticking

406
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,800
points it's very expensive to do

407
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,199
biometric sensors everywhere but

408
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,120
thankfully we'll have phones now which

409
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,760
most of them haven't so we have that

410
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,160
it's very difficult to create protocols

411
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,079
that allow you to log into things um

412
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,399
with web authent and fido 2 and the ctep

413
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,639
workflows which are covering this talk

414
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,680
cool groovy now we've got that ability

415
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
so the standards are out there

416
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,959
everything's coming together and we're

417
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,959
able to like bring this together and

418
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,279
make something happen of it still taking

419
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,399
a while i would have thought we would

420
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,399
have been further by now but some of the

421
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,959
things i found kind of makes sense is

422
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,639
yes

423
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,880
smartphones are ubiquitous

424
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,639
except for 13 of the population does not

425
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,040
have a smartphone yes smartphones are

426
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,199
ubiquitous in the workforce except

427
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,560
that's only the white collar workforce

428
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
what happens about your hourly employees

429
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,160
your seasonal employees what happens

430
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,320
about your gig workers we start parsing

431
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,480
that out there's so many different

432
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,959
people today who don't have technology

433
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,720
which i would argue is probably a much

434
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,480
bigger conversation

435
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,079
than why can't they log in as

436
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,519
passwordless if we're honest with

437
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,360
ourselves why are we not paying people

438
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,680
better and equipping them better but

439
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,800
simply from an authentication

440
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,399
perspective lots of problems

441
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,560
okay well i can buy that but you said

442
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,000
we've got protocols now like 502. yes

443
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,360
we've also had saml for a while

444
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,720
how many apps right now are single sign

445
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,440
and the problem is that sas apps are

446
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,320
still

447
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,480
surprisingly few in terms of federation

448
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,399
and adoption that protocol so this is

449
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,440
taking some time to to get to that point

450
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,199
but but we're on a good point also

451
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,360
what's kind of cool is that dichotomy of

452
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,759
man versus machine do we make people

453
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,680
remember more things or do we make the

454
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
machine work harder computationally more

455
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
intensive that actually goes away

456
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,560
because with passwordless it's actually

457
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,279
easier which is very uncommon i did a

458
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,639
research project

459
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,800
uh i want to say five years ago now and

460
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
i asked people hey tell me how security

461
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,880
improved your life or made you faster

462
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,639
and once they stopped laughing at me

463
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,800
oftentimes they just stared at me

464
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,480
uncomfortably

465
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,720
and said you're from the office of the

466
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,399
cso aren't you

467
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,279
like i am i'm sorry is there any way

468
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,600
that things got faster like when you go

469
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,720
away

470
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
right it's very rare we're like no we

471
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,320
really made your life better but with

472
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,079
passiveness we can do that single sign

473
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,440
there's another thing there's other ways

474
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,560
to do it

475
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,040
so that's cool all right so for this

476
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,360
talk i want to cover like a path to get

477
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,759
to passwordless mfa we'll talk about

478
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,040
we'll talk about authentication

479
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,160
workflows

480
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,319
looking at ways to do the trust right so

481
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,400
if everything breaks like i talked about

482
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
earlier with different factors how can

483
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,520
you still have trust in that

484
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,760
authentication and then enabling the

485
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,520
passwords experience and moving to a

486
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,959
toolkit

487
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:15,919
all right

488
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,400
first do mfa we all should do mfa

489
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
everyone should do mfa so the whole idea

490
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,919
of course is pastor listens we just

491
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,319
remove the password and we do mfa

492
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,919
knowing of course that there's a lot of

493
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,280
factors that are still weak and

494
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
vulnerable okay so fine we'll do

495
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,200
passwordless but we will remove all the

496
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,720
weak and vulnerable

497
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,880
except for use cases again with hourly

498
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,320
and gig workers and customers we're

499
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,640
going to email them and provide qr codes

500
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,400
and i talked about any of that talk

501
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,799
about strong passwords which is one of

502
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,520
these factors in play

503
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,080
so rather than logging in with our our

504
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,840
username and password we get rid of that

505
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,640
password we're like haha we're good

506
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,160
except there's still some additional

507
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,840
things we want to do we actually want to

508
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,360
make sure

509
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,440
that we are checking things we want to

510
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,600
make sure that we've got two factor

511
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,960
because

512
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,600
auditors are auditors and auditors take

513
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,480
time

514
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,960
and if we go hey mr otter guess what you

515
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,120
know that standard you said about 2fa

516
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,360
like yeah you did pci yeah you know that

517
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,640
standard

518
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,840
yeah that was great when you did it

519
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,760
uh-huh we got rid of that

520
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,360
they won't like that

521
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,039
they will push back and they'll argue

522
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,799
and they'll mock us down and then we'll

523
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,080
have an audit fighting we'll have to

524
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,600
explain to the board or the executive

525
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,360
team why we're no longer compliant but

526
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,200
we are we'll say because it's a stronger

527
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,360
factor no password yes but you need two

528
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
including one that's terrible

529
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,039
what's the old joke about multi-factor

530
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,640
it's something that you've forgotten and

531
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,440
something you've lost we need those two

532
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,400
we need those two

533
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,160
so with passiveness to reflect

534
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,640
multi-factor and reflect sort of the

535
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,919
fault tolerance of these different

536
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,840
factors we want to go ahead and move

537
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,120
towards

538
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,000
um still having two steps

539
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,919
but doing it all in one step if that

540
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,039
makes sense

541
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,080
the standard behind all this is 502.

542
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,160
love me some 502. these are the same

543
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,240
guys who brought you 501. surprisingly

544
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,039
enough uh it's the yuba key standards

545
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,799
that we're all used to right one tap to

546
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,039
get in it's an awesome thing they've

547
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,679
collaborated with uh with duo and with

548
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,160
microsoft with google and apple and they

549
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,760
built it in their browsers and built it

550
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,679
into devices and so now we can go ahead

551
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,360
and log in so if we're sitting there and

552
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,480
i've authenticated to my device

553
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,640
and uh and i'm using a strong

554
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,880
authentication to do that i can pass

555
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,520
that on to the application one of the

556
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,919
things that's cool about that is the key

557
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,080
material that it's exchanged with the

558
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,840
application is on a per application

559
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,960
basis

560
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,320
why does that matter well it matters

561
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,280
because

562
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,160
they probably have 200 applications

563
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,760
um 10 of them have probably been

564
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,280
breached i mean if you want to have some

565
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,000
fun go look at your customers who are

566
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,080
logging into your applications today

567
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,160
pull that customer list and run it

568
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,400
against have i been pwned and see how

569
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,320
many of those accounts have been caught

570
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,880
up in compromise i'm betting the number

571
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,960
is 60 to 80 percent

572
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,799
that is a made-up statistic right here

573
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,559
on stage

574
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,799
check your own data

575
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,160
so

576
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,799
that doesn't work if i've got multiple

577
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,559
different um

578
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,679
you know

579
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,679
signals or multiple different factors

580
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,960
for each one of these applications so if

581
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,480
i compromise this application i can't go

582
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,080
ahead and replay very cool also also

583
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,360
rather nice

584
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,520
i'm going to use the url

585
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,000
as a check mechanism so i don't even

586
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,559
pass that material in if someone's used

587
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,120
a weird character or is phishing me or

588
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,360
doing those things pretty cool pretty

589
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,320
cool now

590
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,720
problem with that is it's platform based

591
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,480
with an internal authenticator what that

592
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,640
means is if i'm doing that with my phone

593
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,960
and now i go to my desktop

594
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,120
my desktop is a different device

595
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,640
doesn't have that authenticator for my

596
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,840
phone

597
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,480
that sucks so now i what i log in with

598
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,840
my desktop

599
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,400
maybe i just never use a desktop again

600
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,440
maybe i retire i like that last option

601
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,039
so they've got a different way to do

602
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,720
this which is okay we're going to move

603
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,320
towards

604
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,600
using a factor outside of the device so

605
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,159
my desktop and my other desktop and my

606
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,880
phone can both use this other factor and

607
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,280
that's going to use the ctab protocol or

608
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
utf

609
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,320
to go ahead and check this is also

610
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,679
pretty cool our first case um is i it's

611
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,000
my device in my

612
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,159
credential on my device

613
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,039
awesome

614
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,520
all right real world how many people

615
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,840
have like shared devices right you'll go

616
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,520
to the hospital recently

617
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,520
or call a call center or and and and

618
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,600
share devices pretty common for those of

619
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,320
us not in 19 so therefore having a

620
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,720
external authenticator pretty groovy

621
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,360
solves for that problem

622
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,280
we can also move that out

623
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,440
to having a roaming external

624
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,720
third party such as doing a push or

625
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,640
doing something else or doing biometric

626
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,400
so that no matter what device i'm using

627
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,960
i can do something external

628
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,480
now all this is happening through the

629
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,039
front channel which means that all the

630
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,240
first three patterns all happening

631
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,360
through the front channel which means

632
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,799
potentially could get intercepted it

633
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,559
could get messed with

634
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,919
which means

635
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,000
potentially that we've got

636
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,480
threat vectors so another option which

637
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,039
is my preferred one which is the user

638
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,880
logs into the application and the

639
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,799
application behind the scenes rather

640
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,200
than through my computer

641
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,520
does some sort of check with a

642
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,320
authenticator to go ahead and log in so

643
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
four different ways of deploying this

644
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,159
all within the protocol also within that

645
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,240
protocol of course is threat models in

646
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,840
different ways that they've figured

647
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,639
people will break this

648
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,799
all right so what this looks like in

649
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,400
practice is i've got my username and

650
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,760
password and i'm logging into the cloud

651
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,600
and logging something on param log into

652
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,480
advice

653
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,559
and away i go and i want to go ahead and

654
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,960
put mfa in there first so that i can

655
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,320
enroll them and make sure that we get

656
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,400
those other factors either utf or push

657
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,840
or something and then get rid of the

658
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,320
password

659
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,520
easy first problem

660
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,080
we need to make sure that they can't

661
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,720
downshift factors this is another

662
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,039
problem that happens in multi-factor oh

663
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,960
you can't log in no problem i'll send

664
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,159
you an email um oh your your super

665
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,799
strong authenticator utf token that

666
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,280
you've enrolled is no longer with you

667
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,080
no problem i'll send you an sms code

668
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,640
so at that point in time what

669
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,360
is the effective stopping power

670
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,440
of that control if you can downshift it

671
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,039
pretty low right it's going to be the

672
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,440
strongest is this the least

673
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,799
strongest factor uh in the downshift or

674
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,960
or in the recovery oh i lost everything

675
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,919
so i'm just going to go ahead and

676
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,480
re-enroll awesome how do you prove your

677
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,720
view

678
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,640
one of the interesting ways side note

679
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,000
one of the interesting things i was

680
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,080
playing with if you guys seen the selfie

681
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,760
uh authentication

682
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,080
this is kind of cool you hold up your

683
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,720
your id to your phone and then you turn

684
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,799
your phone around and take a selfie

685
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,720
and they're like aha you are you turn

686
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,840
your head a little bit so it's not deep

687
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,559
fake okay you're in i love that that's

688
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,480
exciting identity proofing great

689
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,039
solution um

690
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,279
how many people are using that

691
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,279
not many it's usually back to links and

692
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,200
qr codes and driving me nuts so

693
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,600
downshifting first problem

694
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,039
second problem is making sure they're of

695
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,799
course avoiding all those factors in the

696
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,400
downshift

697
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,240
all right so we get people on some

698
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,000
different factors that can log in we get

699
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,720
some place to to beef that up let's talk

700
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,039
about consolidated workflows part of

701
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,640
this problem is goes back to what i said

702
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,400
earlier one of the reasons why this

703
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,360
technology is taking a little bit longer

704
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,720
than i thought

705
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,240
besides the point that for some reason

706
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,440
we've been doing other things the past

707
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,720
couple years

708
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,480
what the hell is that

709
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,840
i think we should be focusing on

710
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,360
authentication under this that's work

711
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,200
from home and that's save lives okay

712
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,039
that's important too but

713
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,000
think about the passwords people

714
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,520
part of it is a lot of these

715
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,679
applications take a real long time sas

716
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,200
applications take a real long time to

717
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,120
support protocols another part of course

718
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,279
is that we've got a lot of passwords a

719
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,200
lot of applications

720
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,360
love looking at my password manager and

721
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,520
seeing the 400 passwords that i've got

722
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,320
in there um again standard made up on

723
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,080
stage i'd encourage you to look at your

724
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,840
own people in their own passwords they

725
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,919
probably have 191 that is not a stat

726
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,480
made up on stage that's a recent uh

727
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,520
recent stat from 2019 i think it was

728
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,200
a lot of passwords a lot of applications

729
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
to to handle so rather than doing this

730
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,960
on a one-off what we want to do is think

731
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,440
about ways to like put in place sso so

732
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,960
that i can go ahead and do password

733
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,279
listen to my sso portal my ssl portal

734
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,279
can talk to saml everything else and you

735
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,720
say but wolf you just told me a lot of

736
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,320
applications don't support san juan and

737
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,360
go

738
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,960
i know

739
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,720
passwords are going to take so long to

740
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,840
kill

741
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,440
but that gets us a ways down the path

742
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,200
now how many applications

743
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,960
typical enterprise is running 1400

744
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,440
applications that seems like a lot

745
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,799
how many of those are going to support

746
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,559
salmon probably half how many of those

747
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,320
are going to be worth putting in sample

748
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,520
probably half of that so we're talking

749
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,559
about 200 applications i would estimate

750
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,360
to move into a pass or less which means

751
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,120
1200 probably that are good attack

752
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,480
surface

753
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,679
and that's of course if you're attacking

754
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,559
the ui if you're a pen tester like

755
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,679
yeah 1400 applications let's do the math

756
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,240
that probably translates into 15 000 api

757
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,320
endpoints this data i just saw on dark

758
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,840
reading which blew my mind typical

759
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,880
enterprise 2022 15 000

760
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,440
api endpoints

761
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,840
love that from a red team perspective

762
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,679
how many of those are protected with mfa

763
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,559
or pacifists

764
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,640
i'm going with five i like the number

765
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,480
five

766
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,559
and that's assuming of course modern

767
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,120
tech stack legacy oftentimes comes up

768
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,640
rack up we don't have a good solution

769
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,919
for mainframes uh legacy legacy windows

770
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,080
applications where we're still having to

771
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,240
be on-prem legacy managers who want

772
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,400
workers to come into the office

773
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,600
i suggest replacing the ladder upgrading

774
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,960
the former

775
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,640
um but we also have to figure out what

776
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,919
we're going to do with this legacy

777
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,200
that's going to be like application

778
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
proxies and off proxies and everything

779
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
bottom line here is

780
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,880
legacy protocols will get us this will

781
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,200
be in a vector that adversaries will go

782
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,520
through microsoft got hit with this

783
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,120
early days

784
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,200
of o365

785
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,480
why because they were supporting my

786
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,000
legacy protocols of course why wouldn't

787
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,039
you

788
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,760
my users still use smtp they loved it

789
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,720
1993 they love it today it is a great

790
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,760
protocol

791
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,120
so microsoft is supporting all these

792
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,159
protocols

793
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,440
and they're allowing you to log in

794
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,039
through all these different endpoints

795
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,720
and you would there is a great attack

796
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,559
where you log in through an unprotected

797
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,039
endpoint and you get a samwell insertion

798
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,120
and you pass that samwell insertion into

799
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,880
sharepoint and sharepoint will go like

800
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,279
yeah that looks groovy come on in

801
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,520
like okay even if sharepoint had mfa

802
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,720
enabled

803
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,600
even if all everything was perfect you

804
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,360
could pass that token around

805
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,440
not cool not cool we're going to still

806
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,720
have that from a legacy protocol

807
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,320
perspective there's going to be a

808
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,799
million and one different opportunities

809
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,919
from an api perspective the api

810
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,440
landscape is still

811
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,559
horribly

812
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,159
unsecured

813
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,240
to get jots and get assertions and pass

814
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,080
them around and it's again assuming we

815
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,240
even know about these applications

816
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,960
when i put that stat on twitter that 15

817
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,919
000 apis according to the survey they're

818
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,720
like oh i must be missing 10 000 apis

819
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,559
someone replied back and i'm thinking

820
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,399
yes

821
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,240
you probably are

822
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,480
and i'm not saying that to be mean um

823
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,240
when when i look at some of the cases

824
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,720
from duo they'll deploy like mfa and

825
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,840
they'll get a device inventory and

826
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,200
they'll think we've got

827
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,760
20 000 devices now deploy in the go

828
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,120
we've got

829
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
60 000 devices

830
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,480
when i first moved to cloud i thought i

831
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,919
had 200 apps

832
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,080
and then flooded caspian

833
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,760
it was not 200.

834
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,360
so we need to be aware of these things

835
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,960
and get ahead of these things

836
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,320
all right now we need to talk about

837
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,240
increasing the trust and applications so

838
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,679
in this step of course we've got

839
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,000
username and programming mfa

840
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,960
we need to look at ways

841
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,360
that we can look at device trust which

842
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,080
is probably one of the the predominant

843
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,440
ways today to reduce attack surface

844
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,480
if it is wolf

845
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,880
coming from wolf's house

846
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,039
on wolf's device

847
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,360
with wolf's username

848
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,120
and wolf wolf's

849
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,200
fingerprint

850
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
it's probably me

851
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,720
and if it's not

852
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,159
i'm going to 1099 that bastard

853
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,960
i need i need some help

854
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,559
please i'll give you my no i'm just

855
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,240
kidding please do not break in my house

856
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,399
that's not really an invitation

857
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,960
all right um and then the next thing is

858
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,720
once you're in passive device trust

859
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,399
looking for some validation so let's

860
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,159
let's look at the first side of things

861
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,679
this is again putting more of an onus on

862
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,760
the machine this is rules and policy and

863
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,840
correlation uh we could we could talk

864
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,600
about like device identity right if it

865
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,720
really is wolf's device well how do i

866
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,000
know it's wealth device well maybe it's

867
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,760
because i got something in the tpm or

868
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,360
the secure enclave that says this is

869
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,880
wolf's device maybe it's because i've

870
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,679
got certificates which can be just a

871
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,679
oh incredibly frustrating to manage

872
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,679
certificates on the device

873
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,520
fleet right i think anyone's doing that

874
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,600
knows this the device certainly aren't

875
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,520
responding or aren't in the right vault

876
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,200
or don't become available or have

877
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,360
expired a bunch of problems there but

878
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,960
maybe we do that with search base which

879
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,880
i like at least because we're doing a

880
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,279
strong based authentication or maybe we

881
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,600
do it with an agent or mdm

882
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,039
so different ways we can do device

883
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,279
identity but the trick is with web

884
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,640
authen and ctap to tie a user to a

885
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,520
device or in the case of shared devices

886
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,240
to tie user to a roaming authenticator

887
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,159
that can be used to prove to the device

888
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,000
that relates me

889
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,960
groovy

890
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,080
now

891
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,000
um you guys remember the early days of

892
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,200
ransomware

893
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,480
did anyone really think it was like

894
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,679
important or that we all just sort of

895
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,120
like laugh about it

896
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,480
am i the only one who's laughing about

897
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,399
it who thought like ransomware in like

898
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,200
2005 was like remember and to bring us

899
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,240
all back

900
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,080
ransomware 2005 was like your uncle

901
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,360
called you and goes i don't know what

902
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,039
happened but my computer looks weird and

903
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,799
they tell me i need to send

904
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,399
a coin bit

905
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,200
right 2005 ran somewhere they won't take

906
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,279
that it's like

907
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,200
it's the old people i love them i will

908
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,960
help them out right that's what we

909
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,640
thought and then the ransomware guys

910
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,880
went hey we've got money we should go

911
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,960
after the the companies with the big

912
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,240
money and ransom went from like a dollar

913
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,799
to like 7 million

914
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,559
and suddenly it's annoying but it

915
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,200
started off in this consumer space

916
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,440
what i think is really interesting is

917
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,720
another thing that's right now in the

918
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,399
consumer space is remote uh remote fraud

919
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,279
right hi i'm i'm bill gates and i need

920
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,200
to fix your computer and my uncle's like

921
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,799
call bill gates sure help me out

922
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,039
my windows is really slow

923
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,480
and then they like get you on and they

924
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,919
you know they get the password or

925
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,840
something that type of attack right now

926
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,919
is is very much i feel like ransomware

927
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,919
in 2005. it's a consumer thing we're not

928
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,399
taking it seriously when we've really

929
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,399
reduced the attack service to i want to

930
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,200
compromise you i need to compromise your

931
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,880
computer and other things we're going to

932
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,720
see a very big increase

933
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,960
in those types of attacks i believe so

934
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,720
therefore we need to look at more than

935
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,679
just is this the computer we look at the

936
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,679
the os version the browser version we

937
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,600
need to look at what is the state of

938
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,760
that device uh we need to make sure it's

939
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,760
not jailbroken or infected those sort of

940
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
things

941
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,200
right away we're into another problem

942
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,640
don't we because

943
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,440
if we've got a device workforce so we've

944
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,320
got union rules if we've got

945
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,000
um

946
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,519
any number of different things depending

947
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,039
on the culture they're gonna be like

948
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,399
yeah no you're not putting anything on

949
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,960
my box or no that's my personal device

950
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,480
if you wanna do that provide me a

951
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,120
corporate device and the cfo's going no

952
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,600
no we're not we're not buying computers

953
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
and phones for everybody you're like but

954
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,960
he won't do it like we'll figure out

955
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,279
another way so we are we're gonna run

956
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,120
some issues with this and there's some

957
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,360
different ways to do it like mdm light

958
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,960
and looking at user agent strings and

959
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,320
different different ways to think about

960
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,600
it

961
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,840
all right that is like that is the hard

962
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,000
fast rules right this is the yes no

963
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,559
answers that is the the yes you're

964
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,320
infected or no you're not affected let's

965
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,559
talk next about some of the more

966
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,120
exciting stuff um first i want to go

967
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,399
back to this guy

968
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,080
ibm 1794. i told you there's two

969
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,840
interesting things about right one was

970
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,080
very first password and password preach

971
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,080
second thing was

972
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,120
hal

973
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,559
right the hell 9000 arthur c clarke the

974
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,960
end of space odyssey with all the weird

975
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,120
music at the very end but not the very

976
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,000
end

977
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,960
at the very middle of the very end

978
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,880
hal starts singing as he's being

979
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,799
unplugged and seeing daisy if you guys

980
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,600
remember this this is weird right why

981
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
would he be singing daisy that is

982
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,720
ridiculous and i have wondered for every

983
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,640
single minute of every single day since

984
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,600
i found the answer of why that was and

985
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,840
here's the answer the ibm

986
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,639
1794 was the first computer to sing they

987
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,639
taught us thing daisy arthur c clarke

988
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,960
was touring an ibm plant and they made

989
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,918
it sing daisy that is fantastic and they

990
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,000
took ibm and added a couple letters to

991
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,239
hell and had it sync

992
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,440
we've been thinking about smart

993
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,839
computers for a long time but we thought

994
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,520
that we'd be all passwords by now and we

995
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,918
thought by 2001 we'd have half

996
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,079
or at least at least if you're like a

997
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,320
jetsons fan like if you love the gucci

998
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,000
style of the 60s you thought maybe i'd

999
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,079
have at least a rosie right i had this

1000
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,480
sassy robot made that would cook for me

1001
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,960
and push around the vacuum

1002
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,119
so i priced it out

1003
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,599
it was like 600 thousand dollars i was

1004
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,639
like trying to figure out what it would

1005
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,960
take to have like a rosie um and i'm

1006
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,480
like yeah and then we could have like a

1007
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,918
robot that would push her on a vacuum

1008
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,000
and my wife's like

1009
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,920
or we could buy a vacuum that just

1010
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,119
pushes around itself

1011
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,119
okay that's like six hundred dollars

1012
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,240
maybe 200 if you get it on sale fine so

1013
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,040
a lot of what happens with ai and ml is

1014
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,480
it gets hyped up because we think it's

1015
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,599
going to be how we think it's going to

1016
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,880
be rosy we think it's going to be

1017
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,240
amazing we think it's going to solve all

1018
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,320
the problems and it won't and it doesn't

1019
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,720
and that's stupid what is smart is to

1020
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,000
use it where it makes sense where it's

1021
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,920
something like a rosie or where it makes

1022
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,599
sense where it's doing something very

1023
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,520
very well known like again back to

1024
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,160
alyssa's talk with the fakes or finding

1025
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,320
slide images we were like hey show me

1026
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,680
cake and it's like here's all the things

1027
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,440
that are cake and you're like

1028
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,880
most of those are cakes some of those

1029
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,240
are sushi

1030
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,720
but that's okay it's good enough

1031
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,160
one's a cupcake i don't know i'll think

1032
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,320
about it it might be in the bun so

1033
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,640
when we use ai that way it makes a lot

1034
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,720
of sense when we use data to sort of

1035
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,480
figure out

1036
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,240
when an attacker is being successful or

1037
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,560
not i think that makes sense

1038
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,440
um

1039
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,040
when we

1040
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,599
apply to security we oftentimes run into

1041
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,520
these problems where there's high

1042
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,440
variability in normal use and attacks

1043
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,960
i'm going to look at ai across

1044
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,079
everything and use ueba and tell me when

1045
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,640
people are abnormal and the little poor

1046
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,839
little bot looks and goes everything's

1047
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,280
abnormal and then we freak out we block

1048
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,560
everything and then

1049
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,440
for some reason people get mad

1050
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,599
it's much better using these models i

1051
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,359
believe to look for very very specific

1052
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,680
things i'm very pro aiml when it's

1053
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,599
things like tell me when a computer is

1054
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,000
doing something weird tell me when

1055
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,400
something is abnormal

1056
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,920
tell me when

1057
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,680
you know

1058
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,400
impossible travel or the browser's

1059
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,160
changed or it's not even a browser i

1060
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,560
thought it was jane at home and it's a

1061
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,920
computer from

1062
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,720
russia with a headless browser logging

1063
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,839
into the bank account that should

1064
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,440
probably be stopped and we can see that

1065
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,359
very easily with a roomba

1066
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,560
so if you think about the pyramid of

1067
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,960
pain it's really trying to use

1068
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,960
those hard and fast rules to weed out

1069
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,440
what we know is bad early on

1070
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,920
early on and using the ml

1071
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,320
really after that after we removed a lot

1072
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,599
of the noise

1073
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,680
to highlight any sort of patterns that

1074
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,079
may be popping up

1075
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,359
because looking at this trying to figure

1076
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,160
it out it's just not going to work

1077
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,440
especially if you're getting like 10 000

1078
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,280
alerts a day which a lot of socks are as

1079
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,480
we know

1080
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,400
it's much better to run it through get

1081
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,320
some contextual awareness and highlight

1082
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
what those problems are so good data

1083
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,440
models

1084
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,280
after the rules is really important in

1085
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,560
terms of increasing that trust

1086
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,359
roomba's not rosie's

1087
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,280
purpose build ai

1088
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,680
so we've increased the trust by looking

1089
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,359
at the device

1090
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,839
authentication recognizing that someone

1091
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,520
can steal a certain certain go bad or

1092
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,560
anything

1093
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,880
we've increased the trust by looking at

1094
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,480
the state recognizing yes someone may

1095
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,960
bypass that or be a good attacker have

1096
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,480
some custom malware or all that sort of

1097
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,920
stuff

1098
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,119
and then we've got some residual risk

1099
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,280
that will reduce by running that through

1100
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,359
some data science

1101
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,280
against a good model against a level of

1102
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,040
set of data with some known bad

1103
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,599
signatures to go ahead and pop up things

1104
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,760
and then block that connection all that

1105
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,760
that sort of increased trust side i

1106
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,440
think is incredibly important part of

1107
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,359
this conversation why again because we

1108
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,440
can't trust any factors certainly not

1109
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
passwords

1110
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,280
all right once we're in there

1111
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,320
we're going to move everything to

1112
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,920
passwordless why not

1113
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,960
pick our individual use cases

1114
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,280
get rid of the passwords

1115
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,880
and use the controls i mentioned earlier

1116
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,400
to increase that trust

1117
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,560
better devices

1118
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,200
for smarter enclaves behavior analytics

1119
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,040
running our policies all those sort of

1120
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,320
things

1121
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,560
because now we're saying i'm not just

1122
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,680
trusting

1123
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,760
a single factor

1124
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,920
to authenticate you i'm trusting a

1125
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,079
multitude of different signals to make

1126
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,400
sure you really are you and and i

1127
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,200
recognize and build my system such that

1128
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,960
if you're not you

1129
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,880
if there is fraud and there will be and

1130
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
it will happen that it's a manageable

1131
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,400
amount of raw that we can act on and

1132
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,760
respond to in a reasonable way

1133
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,520
and then we just cycle that again and

1134
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,040
again and again in the spring fashion

1135
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,079
now

1136
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,119
one concern about this is okay that's

1137
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,079
cool

1138
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,040
um

1139
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,960
so i'm gonna do that for my desktops i'm

1140
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,960
gonna do that for my phones

1141
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,200
do that for my call center i'm gonna do

1142
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,119
that for these web apps over there i'm

1143
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,320
building something over here i'll do

1144
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,000
that for over there i've got customer

1145
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,400
use cases i got some b2b use cases

1146
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,599
and next thing you know you got like a

1147
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,000
dozen different applications and a bunch

1148
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,200
of different ways for things to be

1149
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,520
misconfigured and broke can go wrong so

1150
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,200
another part of that of course is making

1151
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,760
sure that as we're stacking this on from

1152
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,599
a defense and depth perspective we're

1153
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,920
still thinking about economy a mechanism

1154
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,680
which is not having a million and one

1155
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,960
tools

1156
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,599
i love this stat this is from

1157
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,200
2019

1158
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,440
which was that the more vendors were

1159
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,599
used the longer people were down it went

1160
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,880
up to uh 17 hours with 50 tools i want

1161
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,119
to be the team with 50 tools

1162
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,720
don't want to be the team down for 17

1163
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,560
hours and first might tell them this is

1164
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,079
so weird but then i remembered i had

1165
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,920
this outage um

1166
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,000
when i was with financial services and i

1167
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,359
brought all my team together like fix

1168
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,320
this

1169
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,160
guest boss i wish that's how it happened

1170
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,680
what a real one is what the hell is

1171
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,839
going on they're like we don't know i'm

1172
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,680
like go and figure it out and so they

1173
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,400
all ran to their own consoles and uh i

1174
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,320
gave them like i don't know an hour hour

1175
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,599
later everyone comes back and the

1176
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,280
networking guy like what is it it's like

1177
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,880
it's a networking problem i'm like i

1178
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,079
knew it

1179
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,680
probably dns

1180
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,200
ask the server guy i'm like what is the

1181
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,119
problem because it's our virtualization

1182
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,800
stack the cpu and the memory is

1183
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,720
everything like i knew it

1184
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,960
should have never virtualized

1185
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,359
everything just kept on ibm 1794 we

1186
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,760
won't be having these problems right now

1187
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,560
and

1188
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,040
every single person i swear to you

1189
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,839
blamed their stack it was the network it

1190
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,560
was the storage it was the compute the

1191
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,800
security guy was cheryl's the russians

1192
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,319
it was no one could give me a good

1193
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,160
answer and so we actually had to get go

1194
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,400
back through and figure it out and i

1195
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,920
believe this because when we got to that

1196
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,480
many tools every single tool is giving

1197
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,040
you a different answer and it's just a

1198
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,880
complete mess to do higher in the space

1199
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,839
so

1200
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,440
taking all this

1201
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,520
and continuing to federate it out and

1202
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,240
moving into more of a passive estate

1203
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
and integrating the technology so we can

1204
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,200
get better results

1205
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,160
security outcomes study is a study done

1206
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,520
by scientia

1207
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,680
in in partnership with cisco

1208
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,520
and uh one of the things that they found

1209
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,000
was that 41

1210
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,640
of companies with highly integrated

1211
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,319
systems

1212
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,000
reported i'm sorry

1213
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,599
let me say that again

1214
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,280
organizations with highly integrated

1215
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,359
systems reported 41

1216
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,480
more

1217
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,520
likely

1218
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,040
to

1219
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,640
have threat detection if something

1220
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,800
happened they were more than twice as

1221
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,560
likely than their peer group to be able

1222
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,240
to find out what happened and

1223
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,160
all of it and everything so we've got to

1224
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,480
integrate that technology

1225
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,960
all right i'm going to conclude

1226
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,440
i'll open it for questions

1227
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,880
they will

1228
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,240
i don't know stop the recording or start

1229
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,359
the recording i don't know how that part

1230
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,960
works and then i'll start the next part

1231
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,400
of this talk

1232
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,160
but in conclusion

1233
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,280
right

1234
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,359
one of the things that i think is very

1235
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,800
risky about passer-less has to do

1236
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,440
with functional fixedness has to do with

1237
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,760
the fact that as a species we're very

1238
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,560
bad at recognizing something new

1239
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,400
if we're talking about pastorless

1240
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,880
authentication we're already defining it

1241
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,480
as i'm going to get rid of the password

1242
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,560
okay that's cool that's cool

1243
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,640
i'm from detroit drove to chicago

1244
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,119
yesterday drove to milwaukee today

1245
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,520
and uh in detroit 100 years ago what was

1246
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,640
high tech

1247
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,400
it was the hearthless carriage it was a

1248
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,240
carriage without a horse guys this is

1249
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,520
great we're going to get rid of the

1250
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,000
big horse it'll be awesome

1251
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,960
but that entire framing belied all the

1252
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,520
increases and comfort and safety and the

1253
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,760
changes in our society let me go and one

1254
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,839
day to milwaukee to cyphercon right the

1255
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,079
horse's carriage is so antiquated now

1256
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,599
but yet that's how we think about

1257
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,359
pastor's authentication and of course

1258
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,079
we've learned our our lesson in in the

1259
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,319
automotive we don't ever do the same

1260
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,800
mistake again

1261
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,880
not going to touch driverless cars this

1262
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,560
is just a problem we have right we

1263
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,800
always define an innovation by what it's

1264
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,720
not so first thing is as we move to

1265
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,280
passwordless as we finally as a security

1266
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,200
function have something that can provide

1267
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,000
a user benefit we have to think about

1268
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,400
what do we ask what do they owe us what

1269
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
can we use this moment in time for to

1270
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,359
increase to change to refactor because

1271
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,560
we know the bad guys don't stop

1272
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,200
as a matter of fact every single

1273
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,680
time over the past six decades that

1274
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,000
we've stopped we fixed this

1275
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,520
right i was talking about hashes earlier

1276
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,800
every time we've come up with a better

1277
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,319
hashing algorithm

1278
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,839
the criminals have defeated it right we

1279
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,440
move the criminals move we make another

1280
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,200
the criminals make another

1281
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,760
and too many controls get put in with

1282
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,920
the idea that this

1283
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,160
this is the one

1284
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,800
i will do caspy and no one will ever

1285
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,000
copy and paste again

1286
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,119
okay we're just not gonna use your casby

1287
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,040
check mate i mean you know

1288
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,240
everyone thinks we'll put this

1289
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,400
controller and this will be the end but

1290
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,000
we should know by now we should

1291
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,400
recognize that every time we do

1292
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,079
the criminal takes a step forward

1293
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,800
everything we do include improves the

1294
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,640
the strength of the criminal

1295
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,400
so what do we need to do next

1296
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,359
um

1297
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,520
in terms of street cred in terms of

1298
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,359
credentials we have some patches and

1299
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,040
some fixes and some things to do

1300
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,359
immediately to shore up passwords and

1301
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,280
multi-factor we've got to do that we've

1302
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,720
got to get more folks on the

1303
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,760
multi-factor more folks uh recognizing

1304
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,760
that passwords aren't doing it we've got

1305
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,160
to put in place better controls when the

1306
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,000
multi-factor starts getting attacked

1307
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,040
more

1308
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,760
all that needs to happen meantime things

1309
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,720
like pass or less 502 and whatnot great

1310
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,480
for doing pilot programs great for

1311
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,560
exploring especially if you're building

1312
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,200
an application if anyone in here is in

1313
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,319
sas

1314
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,640
please support saml and finally support

1315
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,359
502 so that we can use this and we can

1316
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,000
get off of it

1317
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,400
we need to tie our authentication

1318
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,480
changes to broader initiatives i like

1319
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,560
passwordless as like a user business

1320
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,680
case for xero trust or user business

1321
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,640
aspect of digital modernization those

1322
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,240
sort of things

1323
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,319
and along that same lines we need to

1324
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,680
take steps to increase trust and

1325
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,280
authentication because we know the

1326
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,560
adversaries are just going to try and

1327
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,760
find ways to work around it

1328
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,119
all right

1329
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:47,760
questions

1330
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,680
[Music]

1331
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,720
yes sir

1332
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,680
how have you had conversations

1333
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,680
individuals

1334
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,119
i heard the first part of that how do i

1335
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,400
have what conversations have i had with

1336
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,960
users that

1337
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,160
because of fourth and fifth amendments

1338
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,400
that is another really good example of

1339
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,760
what happens so

1340
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,359
um

1341
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,880
this happens a lot in international

1342
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,800
travel i travel internationally i won't

1343
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,280
use biometrics on my phone because it's

1344
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,000
been the passwords are protected

1345
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,920
but i can make the as a police officer

1346
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,200
it can make you look at the phone and

1347
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,040
now i'm into your devices

1348
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,720
so that is a very good thing so one of

1349
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,480
the things we can talk about there is

1350
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,839
maybe you still have a pin or maybe

1351
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,800
yourself something to to provide it or

1352
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,079
conversely

1353
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,920
maybe you take additional steps like

1354
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,440
disabling past or less when you're

1355
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,480
traveling or in those situations

1356
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,400
similarly we're starting to see a

1357
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,520
tiering of security by location my home

1358
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,760
office is safe-ish

1359
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,359
my corporate office is safe-ish

1360
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,960
everywhere else is not

1361
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,880
so that's sort of like thinking through

1362
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,119
the emotions in different places can

1363
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,920
influence that but you're spot on if

1364
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,839
if i'm being asked hey

1365
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,920
do everything with biometric but yet i

1366
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,440
know that someone can force me to do

1367
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,560
things i'm going to be very leery with

1368
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,920
biometric

1369
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,400
touch key is another thing like uh um

1370
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,000
keys and things like that would probably

1371
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,920
be what i would be pointing people do as

1372
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,160
well

1373
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,720
yes sir

1374
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,800
um privacy uh

1375
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,079
the club

1376
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,839
so how do you ask them sorry uh this

1377
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,599
slide the slide talking about kind of

1378
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,240
the future of passwordless uh

1379
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,000
it looked like a data set that could be

1380
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,640
mined what what are some things that can

1381
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,800
uh can mitigate that challenge

1382
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,839
so schneier once said that security is

1383
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,920
both actual security and perception of

1384
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,200
security

1385
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,359
so i'm going to address actual security

1386
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:48,319
and then i'm going to tell you why none

1387
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,599
of it matters because of perception

1388
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,079
one of the things i like about 502 and i

1389
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,000
like about these standards is that that

1390
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,880
biometric data and that privacy style

1391
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,119
data is stored on your device especially

1392
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,319
if it's your phone or your personal

1393
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,079
device it doesn't leave your device it's

1394
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,000
not centralized the only thing that

1395
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,040
leaves your device is a derived key so i

1396
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,720
use the biometric to unlock my phone and

1397
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,960
my phone then has a

1398
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,280
key pairing with the application

1399
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,119
so i don't necessarily have

1400
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,040
privacy concerns now you may say well

1401
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,960
wait a minute but the application will

1402
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,400
know who you are and i'll say yes it

1403
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,480
will but you've logged into the

1404
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,559
application so you decided at that point

1405
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,760
in time to give up some anonymity

1406
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,559
now

1407
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,079
all that

1408
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,359
is true

1409
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,839
but the perception is big brother is

1410
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,880
stealing all your passwords and all your

1411
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,359
faces and all your fingerprints and i

1412
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,839
now have them the reality is is that a

1413
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,599
lot of organizations are still running

1414
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:46,960
in corporate culture we're like i don't

1415
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,280
trust you to use biometric

1416
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,040
i don't trust you at all and you know

1417
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,720
frankly i think security people and i.t

1418
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,920
people have shot ourselves in the foot

1419
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,599
over the past couple decades and there

1420
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,200
are reasons that perhaps they should

1421
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,599
trust us so there is a technological

1422
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,079
answer which we can do immediately

1423
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,400
and there is a cultural answer which is

1424
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,760
going to be a much longer haul

1425
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,280
any other

1426
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:19,660
questions sweet yeah thank you

1427
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,670
[Applause]

1428
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,240
okay

1429
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,999
[Music]

1430
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,720
you
