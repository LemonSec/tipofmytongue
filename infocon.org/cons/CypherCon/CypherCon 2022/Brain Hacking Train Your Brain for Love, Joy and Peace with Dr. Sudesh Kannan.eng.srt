3
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:29,238
[Music]

4
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,218
all right

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,460
foreign

6
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:12,479
[Music]

7
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,700
stress anxiety depression

8
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,259
disconnectedness pretty much all of us

9
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,479
I'm sure keep your hand raised keep your

10
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,479
hand raised if you've used mindfulness

11
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,340
or meditation

12
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,920
um or if you believe it can be useful

13
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,460
for those days okay keep your hands up

14
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,280
if you've used technology to catalyze

15
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,020
that to enhance that

16
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,479
and one final question still a couple

17
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,939
hands up if you've done that in a

18
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,259
scientific manner

19
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,299
oh I like that

20
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,340
okay thank you um we're gonna get

21
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,259
started just wanted to pull the audience

22
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,960
to give you kind of an overview of how

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,339
we're going to approach this talk

24
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,680
so this is going to make you track this

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,780
session right you're going to get most

26
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,479
rather than supporting lecture with more

27
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,459
than being trackable and I'm going to

28
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,258
tell these three objectives again and

29
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:14,180
again right the first one was

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,640
we all strive for happiness every little

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,739
freaking thing we do is for happiness

32
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,840
love joy peace right

33
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,060
but we don't realize that our brain was

34
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,099
not designed for that

35
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,140
our brain was designed for me for two

36
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,920
things

37
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,340
sex and survival right so that's the

38
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,200
first topic we're going to talk about

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,959
the second topic is how many of you

40
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,959
remember the first time you rode your

41
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,239
bike without training wheels raise your

42
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,500
hands

43
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,360
how old are you sir

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,360
six do you still go over it today

45
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,060
right and that is what we call an

46
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,200
Awakening

47
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,420
and I promise most of you are going to

48
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,580
be awakened today not talking about

49
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,040
Nirvana not about Enlightenment talking

50
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,780
about Awakening

51
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,879
and then the third one is we need your

52
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,560
freaking help

53
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,140
because you saw right when we talked

54
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,900
about scientific have you studied your

55
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,400
meditation practice scientifically

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,180
including myself

57
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,980
and I've been a practitioner for two

58
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,920
years for 20 years so that's the

59
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,239
structure and I'm going to come back to

60
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,000
that again

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,940
oh I'm by the way my name is uh sudesh

62
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,819
Taran most people call me Dr k a big

63
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,459
story of how all this started out I

64
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,980
hated my meditation teacher I hated my

65
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,300
yoga teacher

66
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,480
High School I was 16 years old in India

67
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,879
I was mandatory right

68
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,459
and everybody in my class was turning

69
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,640
into a human pretzel I could not and I

70
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,480
cannot sell today

71
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,500
but one fine day the teacher taught us

72
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,200
shavasana as you know what savasana

73
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,720
means it's the dead body horse

74
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,739
any freaking idiot can do it

75
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:06,180
so I did it

76
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,080
and what he did was he walked us through

77
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,120
a rather gruesome situation he said

78
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,400
imagine you're in a beautiful Valley

79
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,660
imagine you are by a Riverside and

80
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,220
there's a funeral fire because in India

81
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,560
we don't bury bodies right we burn them

82
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,440
so your body's in that little part

83
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,240
you're being born your physical Essence

84
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,780
is gone and all is left is the spiritual

85
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,960
Essence right and as I'm telling you

86
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,660
this my body is filled with goosebumps

87
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,759
because I was there

88
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,400
I was lying in the floor Pretty Dirty

89
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,740
floor and India we didn't have yoga mats

90
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,240
that time nobody figured it out till

91
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,380
some American figured it out

92
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,460
and I was in a state of Awakening

93
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,060
and like any true blooded teenager

94
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,180
I promptly forgot about that experience

95
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,240
till I started working on my PhD if any

96
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,160
of you have done your phds or any phds

97
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,680
here got to be one or two phds it's a

98
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,180
freaking nightmare

99
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,100
because you don't know when you're going

100
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,680
to finish your PhD and so I went back to

101
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,639
meditation

102
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,500
right so

103
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,540
that's what my journey is about and

104
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,400
hopefully I share some of the key tips

105
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,860
that we have a lot of misconceptions

106
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,780
about meditation including thinking it's

107
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,100
all about Nirvana it's all about uh it's

108
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,840
all about joy and things like that

109
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,840
so my name is Darren Lawless I'm a

110
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,820
security guy like probably a lot of you

111
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,860
guys are I've been doing it for 20 years

112
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,360
or so

113
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,100
um and

114
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,039
I fancy myself a hacker I'm probably

115
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,900
a different sort of hacker than maybe a

116
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,400
lot of you I'm not I'm not I'm not

117
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,220
digging into code I'm not breaking uh

118
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,440
I'm not breaking code I'm not rewriting

119
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,620
code so much but I'm surely in that

120
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,820
space and in the last 10 years or so

121
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,759
I've discovered uh the world of

122
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,199
biohacking so uh and you know what that

123
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,060
is we can we can get into that if you

124
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,500
don't know if you know it's all the

125
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,000
things that might and it's pretty broad

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,979
right it's everything from

127
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:21,840
uh hacking your nutrition to uh leaving

128
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,600
breathing and uh you know Tech actually

129
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,660
like injecting Tech into your body and

130
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,940
so so the breath is is big and so that's

131
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,819
part of why I dig it and I you know I've

132
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,800
poked into those spaces and I've learned

133
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,139
a little bit and at the same time

134
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,960
um I've also kind of uh started

135
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,080
exploring mindfulness States and trying

136
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,080
to you know feel better try to be less

137
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,300
stressed uh and I've had some success

138
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,520
right so I have some anecdotal uh

139
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,319
evidence for myself that says this

140
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,539
there's something happening here and and

141
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,680
it seems viable and useful and so that's

142
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,780
that's my angle on this on this

143
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,180
discussion and I'm going to let you into

144
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,280
this so some of you are probably

145
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,460
thinking okay Dr King you're a Believer

146
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,039
you you are drinking the Kool-Aid you

147
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,139
think that meditation and mindfulness is

148
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,259
uh is the answer to to life the universe

149
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,220
and everything after 42. after 42. and

150
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,400
Darren a Seeker open to this

151
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,440
um I'm going to introduce you to another

152
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,720
archetype here myself kind of the

153
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,340
skeptic

154
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,500
um

155
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,080
scientifically oriented and some of you

156
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,000
may identify with either the believer

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,940
the Seeker the skeptic maybe all three

158
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,160
I want you to think about where you're

159
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,380
aligned during this talk because there's

160
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,580
going to be something for everyone

161
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,460
during this so join us through this

162
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,919
journey as a skeptic I just want to tell

163
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,080
you just a little bit about myself and

164
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,840
my background here and what uh what this

165
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,340
means for this talk

166
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,880
so I am a um I'm a security analyst um

167
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,120
been doing this for about 20 years which

168
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,340
makes me a little bit of a dinosaur but

169
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,819
we won't we won't acknowledge that

170
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,759
um and before I became a security

171
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,860
analyst or working in security and

172
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,880
hacking I actually study neurology and I

173
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,280
worked as a neurobiofeedback technician

174
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,599
and researcher

175
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,759
and that means that I know I'm familiar

176
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,759
with biofeedback okay yeah you're our

177
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,560
scientist aren't you

178
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,319
um so bio feedback essentially is

179
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,419
monitoring your biological State and

180
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,219
altering something that you do in

181
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,159
response to that so we would take um

182
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,260
patients that had closed head injuries

183
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,720
trauma um physical brain trauma or ADHD

184
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,060
and train them to

185
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,220
change their brain patterns so they

186
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,140
could achieve certain goals

187
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,680
now meditation I'm sure has a lot of

188
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,899
anecdotal evidence that it can be useful

189
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,839
ADHD severely

190
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,959
it's like tortured me have my mind just

191
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,580
like be quiet no I can't do that but I

192
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,880
think what we want to do is analyze

193
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,240
what meditation means how we can use

194
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,399
technology with that and what it means

195
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,800
to the believer the seeker and the

196
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,540
skeptic

197
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,100
with that

198
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,440
okay it's Dr Paster I just want to make

199
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,660
a point I feel a little bit like a

200
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,320
strange nerdy hip-hop group up here

201
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,120
weaving in and out with two microphones

202
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,480
and so forgive us if we break into crap

203
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,019
so this section is going to be

204
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,240
interactive because I want you

205
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,360
to think about I'm obsessed with the

206
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,480
human brain right any guesses how many

207
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,459
pounds does a human brain

208
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:01,619
shout out to answer seven pounds

209
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,959
2.5 pounds 2.5 pounds okay less than two

210
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,459
percent of body weight from most people

211
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:11,040
here right

212
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,440
how much energy does it consume 100

213
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,500
energy how much of that energy goes

214
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,620
there shout out an answer fifty percent

215
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,060
ten percent

216
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,420
25 it's 25 to 30 percent

217
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,100
less than two percent of your body

218
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,860
weight right and if you're like me you

219
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,019
probably eat four pounds of fruits and

220
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,380
vegetables drink five pounds of water

221
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,320
and then here's the magic number 30

222
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,600
pounds of air we breathe 30 pounds of

223
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,740
air of which about 16 to 20 percent is

224
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,019
oxygen guess what

225
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,260
25 goes to your brain

226
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,300
so this is the key thing right this

227
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,100
thing between our heads and what's

228
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,500
fascinating about this is there are

229
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,120
three sections to it and everybody put

230
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,680
your thumbs together put your thumb here

231
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,720
put put your hands together like this

232
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,980
right

233
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,339
this thumbs here is the limbic system

234
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,060
this is the emotional part of us right I

235
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,899
had a boss I hate it right I would drive

236
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,180
and we we both worked we went all over

237
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,279
the world so there were good times when

238
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,839
he was not there in the office I was not

239
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,660
down to office and I drive into the

240
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,640
parking lot and I would see his blue

241
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Toyota and I'd get angry all over how

242
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,920
many of you done that

243
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,180
right

244
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,519
this is the key thing we forget to

245
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,680
understand right we think we are racial

246
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,839
creatures with feelings that's

247
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,000
it's the opposite the emotional

248
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
creatures

249
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,040
and we have thinking as part of that how

250
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,360
many of you listen to Alicia Miller

251
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,720
yesterday

252
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,779
talked about videos changing people and

253
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,140
she was all about facts changing People

254
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,260
 facts never change people okay

255
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,720
what changes people is we make a

256
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,420
decision emotionally right we see this

257
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,420
boy or girl we like and then we find

258
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,720
reasons to like him or her more

259
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,000
and we wonder why we are so screwed up

260
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,339
in our relationship

261
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:19,560
right how many of you have seen a friend

262
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,140
going around with a girl who you know

263
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,260
that's going to crash and burn in hell

264
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,680
raise your hand

265
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,820
so this is the key point I wanted to

266
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,220
understand if you understand this mother

267
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,459
nature gave us four gifts okay I call

268
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,140
them gifts within quotes

269
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,260
the first one is distractibility Jen

270
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,899
thinks she's got a unique ADHD brain

271
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,420
guess what I'm willing to bet all of us

272
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,639
are distracted all the time raise your

273
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,959
hand how many of you are distracted all

274
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,480
the time right we all distracted all the

275
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,459
time why did Mother Nature do that it

276
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,860
was gift to us right 100 000 years ago

277
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,399
our brain was a bottom of the food chain

278
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,459
right a tiger walked by says saw deer

279
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,860
there saw a human being there let me go

280
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,600
out for the human being because the deer

281
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,600
is going to run really fast

282
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,240
hundred thousand years of short time for

283
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,579
the brain to change so you're always

284
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:15,899
looking for trouble how many of you are

285
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,040
looking for trouble all the time raise

286
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,959
your hand all of those are looking for

287
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,040
trouble right

288
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,200
second give Mother Nature gave us is

289
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,399
loneliness

290
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,579
I don't care how happily you're married

291
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:28,260
how you know you your best boyfriend

292
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,899
girlfriend you're lonely right mother

293
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,459
needs to have figured that out for a

294
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,740
reason that's 100 000 years ago I told

295
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,420
you right sixty thousand years ago

296
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,279
there's a cognitive I'm giving you these

297
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,839
numbers just like you know these are

298
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,579
approximate numbers we don't know for

299
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:42,720
sure we seem to have evidence

300
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,000
anthropological evidence sixty thousand

301
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,639
years ago we made this transition in

302
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,079
social behavior

303
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,100
right what is the fun thing is

304
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,600
one-on-one our nearest cousin if I fight

305
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,540
a chimpanzee the chimpanzee didn't hands

306
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,560
down

307
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,019
but we are about 50 people here 50

308
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:03,180
people are these 50 chimpanzees we win

309
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,320
all the time

310
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,600
why because we communicate with each

311
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,519
other and say let's put that fat guy in

312
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,459
the front let him die

313
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:13,800
right so this comes the ability to

314
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,139
communicate right so mother nature gave

315
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,779
us a negative self-taught and the

316
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,760
negative self-talk is based on the

317
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,880
future and it's from the past

318
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,339
and you're always thinking about that

319
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,920
why because they had you had an ancestor

320
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,680
who said oh my God we're gonna all die

321
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,320
if you don't store for food

322
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,260
and that that gentleman's ancestor

323
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,720
probably said nah we'll figure it out

324
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,459
you know when the time comes we'll

325
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,160
figure out food right and his ancestors

326
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,360
died

327
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,660
does that make sense so mother nature

328
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,300
rewarded negative thinking here's the

329
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,440
problem

330
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,779
I haven't found an off switch for my

331
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,220
negative dog anybody found a house

332
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,060
switch for a negative button

333
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,399
and people do that right people do that

334
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,459
the last gift she gave us was meaning or

335
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:08,399
progress I call her see because I think

336
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,220
Mother Nature like my mother and my

337
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,740
mother always gave me gifts you know

338
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,800
and this was one of the gift is so all

339
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,480
these four things right they come back

340
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,459
upon us

341
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:23,339
distraction negative self-talk

342
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,040
loneliness meaning

343
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,079
and here's the thing about meaning you

344
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,360
want love joy and peace in your life

345
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,820
Find meaning and meaning is a made-up

346
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,940
story whatever you believe but it has to

347
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,980
be there because if you don't find a

348
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,079
meaning or purpose in your life your

349
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,779
brain will say let's watch all the

350
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,760
remaining Netflix movies I'm not watched

351
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,660
how many have been there

352
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,760
so why am I talking about this with

353
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,560
meditation our brain was not designed

354
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,940
for happiness I hope you can see that

355
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,100
right the second thing is we're going to

356
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,019
have stress till we die

357
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,660
so Dr K this is bad news what's the good

358
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,800
news

359
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,420
the good news is the next slide

360
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,740
it's the next uh okay the brain can be

361
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,839
trained for loud joy peace

362
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,180
now this sounds too hippie for you to

363
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,160
touchy feely for you

364
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,779
there's science scientific

365
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,459
neuroscientific evidence for the four

366
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:21,839
characteristics

367
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,160
connection optimism resilience and I

368
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,860
call it energy what you call it purpose

369
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,839
very easy

370
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,660
and where is meditation come meditation

371
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,300
is nothing but exercising your brain for

372
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,459
all those four there are literally

373
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:41,519
hundreds of meditation techniques and

374
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,100
we're gonna try some of this raise your

375
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,079
hand if you're willing to try

376
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,480
excellent am I missing some points okay

377
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,940
uh no not at all but I would say that if

378
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,440
you're one of the

379
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,500
folks that are skeptical but you happen

380
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,339
to be an athlete or a musician I would

381
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,320
even argue some some coders fall into

382
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,319
this place and hackers even and you know

383
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,199
that state where everything is what

384
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,199
you're doing at that moment

385
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,760
athletes call it flow those kind of

386
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,099
things if you have if you have that

387
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,380
skepticism but you've experienced those

388
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,780
kind of things I think what you've

389
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,599
really experienced is is something very

390
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,880
similar if not exactly the same as those

391
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,140
meditative states that we're talking

392
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,359
about so excellent so let's get three

393
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,460
water Goods post one who's a skeptic who

394
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,040
says hey this is all crap join us can

395

complex social security device it's not

00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,799
really sophisticated it's a temperature

402
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,840
measurement yeah I think that's actually

403
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,640
an interesting point right these are

404
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,200
just simple devices I think you've got

405

smart watches if you've got fitbits

406
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,280

and then bring it to that right spot

436
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,419

back not resting just straight as much

444
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,880

breathing so I know that

456
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,220

457
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,480
starting by the way yeah

458
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,100
okay how many of you can feel your

459
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,340
breath

460
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,340
okay how many of you can feel your

461
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,400
breath kissing your lips upper lip

462
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,840
in and out

463
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,000
awesome now these are your Styles some

464
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,260
of you raise your hand multiple times

465
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,780
you're you're amazingly aware creatures

466
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,280
you can look down at other people who

467
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,020
can get really nonsense of the time

468
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,100
so first one is awareness that means

469
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,419
you're aware of the space around the

470
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:49,500
room

471
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,120
you can visualize the people around you

472
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,160
though your eyes are closed

473
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,419
you can feel the songs

474
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,539
awesome

475
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,340
raise your hands how many of you feel

476
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,200
some kind of relaxation somewhere raise

477
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,179
your hands

478
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,100
wow

479
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,740
it's a big group here so allow that

480
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,840
relaxation to grow

481
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:22,200
how do you think you can feel a sense of

482
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,280
joy

483
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,220
how you define joy as love or anything

484
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,820
like that or peace or whatever reasons

485
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,520
wow

486
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,679
these people have not been paid by me I

487
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,220
promise you that

488
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,280
and there's a part of your mind that's

489
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,900
chatting and saying what the hell is he

490
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,600
doing what are we going to do next allow

491
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,139
that part

492
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,039
don't have to force anything there

493
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,280
got the zero to ten I will actually feel

494
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,740
oh really eight

495
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,220
okay

496
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:22,380
so someone need

497
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,120
now why don't you just focus on the

498
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,260
breath

499
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,360
then I want you to go deeper in the

500
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,080
relaxation mode

501
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,780
and here's the key thing about

502
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,340
meditation meditation is not about

503
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,539
relaxation

504
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,700
it's not about getting into an orgasmic

505
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,299
state right it's about being aware of

506
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,679
your thoughts being aware of your

507
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,159
Sensations

508
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,559
you know put your put your power in your

509
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,580
heart

510
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,799
put upon your heart

511
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,360
and think of somebody you love

512
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,340
unconditionally

513
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,799
it could be your spouse boyfriend

514
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,760
girlfriend child grandparents anybody

515
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,799
it could be your pet dog

516
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,900
no cats because Dr K is Presidents

517
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,500
against cats

518
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:22,080
have a smile on your face and bless that

519
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,520
person

520
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,400
may you be happy and peaceful

521
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,460
may you be free from fear and suffering

522
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,980
may you live with loud and compassion

523
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,880
make you fully awakened and be free

524
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,640
may I be happy and peaceful

525
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,400
may I be free from fear and suffering

526
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,919
may Allah allow in compassion

527
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,200
we are fully awakened and be free

528
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,280
how many of you feel Joy as you do this

529
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,400
raise offense raise the other hand

530
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,059
awesome

531
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,260
now bless all the people in this room

532
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,059
acknowledge everybody suffers in this

533
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:06,960
room

534
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,640
send it out

535
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,520
maybe be happy and peaceful

536
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,580
maybe be free from Fear suffering

537
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,900
maybe a little bit loud and

538
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,400
compassionate

539
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,620
maybe fully awakened and be free

540
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,220
okay open your eyes stretch your hands

541
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,340
up

542
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,580
that's what I walk you through the very

543
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,740
traditional meditation it's called meta

544
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,720
meditation right you relax and then you

545
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,179
think good of other people and there's a

546
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,640
part of the brain that relaxes you right

547
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,700
so let's start first with uh Shannon

548
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,360
how's the experience it's good so what

549
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,039
do you like about it

550
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,179
um

551
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:52,799
like

552
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,980
does allow me to

553
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,860
let go a lot of just thinking about

554
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,380
everything how many of you think that

555
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,940
she's the only person who has trap in

556
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,020
her head

557
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,840
all of us do right we have a lot of

558
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,340
stuff in our head

559
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,500
and meditation is a powerful state of

560
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,080
letting go so that's awesome we're over

561
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,179
here it was also good

562
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:17,580
um I like the fact that it felt like my

563
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,559
mind went quieter than normal for a

564
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,760
while

565
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,400
that's the goal the goal is not to

566
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,140
switch it off right there are people who

567
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,880
can claim who claim that they can switch

568
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,400
off their thinking even having that

569
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,919
small pause right just being aware of

570
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,960
that makes a difference what about you

571
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,760
Rodney house

572
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,700
uh pretty relaxing yeah okay and what do

573
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,320
you do with your thoughts did you did

574
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,240
the thoughts come a lot of thoughts that

575
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,760
you were really trying to analyze every

576
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,740
um no I just kind of blanked out it was

577
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,600
kind of like I had a clean slate in my

578
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,419
mind and how did that make you feel uh

579
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:52,860
actually I forgot about all the bills or

580
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,260
anything

581
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,120
okay chronic Apostle these people thank

582
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,799
you

583
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,400
all right

584
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,200
thank you

585
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,120
what's the name of the devices by the

586
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,919
way okay look there's nothing but uh

587
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,440
thermometers

588
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,500
two thermometers and a pulse ox

589
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,480
right and and did you guys notice any

590
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,400
changes in your in your in your time she

591
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,419
went all the way to 31.0 yeah so so she

592
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:22,919
had a change she didn't have a change

593
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,120
and his post drop was about uh 15 beats

594
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,719
per uh

595
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,520
and here's the thing about biofeedback

596
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,400
devices right the focus for them is not

597
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,980
to say your team Nirvana it's just a

598
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,140
symptom of sewing you're doing your

599
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,600
practice correct that's not the end goal

600
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,120
the end goal is not relaxing and I'll

601
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,860
talk more about Enlightenment and

602
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,640
Awakening later on

603
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,159
so thanks MC Dr k

604
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,740
um move on so who

605
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,620
does anyone know what I'm sitting in

606
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,440
here

607
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,720
yeah there you go sensory deprivation

608
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,240
chamber so I just want to share a quick

609
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,559
story about the century deprivation

610
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,080
chamber so in this

611
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,600
uh you know I I want to call it a quest

612
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,100
it's more of just sort of investigating

613
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,440
interesting ideas and and things like

614
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,659
that in a biohacking space and also

615
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:21,539
being fairly interested in in some of

616
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,940
the stuff like what we just did here

617
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,919
um I decided to go try a sensory

618
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,020
deprivation chamber for those who you

619
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,340
who don't know it's a uh it's a big

620
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:37,639
box that's like a massive coffin

621
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,740
yeah exactly

622
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,520
it has like 800 pounds of uh Epsom salts

623
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,159
in it so the buoyancy is maxed out the

624
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:48,960
water is heated to a precise temperature

625
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,820
it's entirely blacked out and it's

626
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,000
entirely uh quiet

627
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,220
um and I will say if this sounds

628
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,080
interesting but you have claustrophobia

629
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,659
I would when I would say so

630
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,640
I'm not going to try to talk you into it

631
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,279
but I will say the concept that you're

632
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,539
in a thing

633
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:09,539
goes away very quickly because of all of

634
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:12,000
that lack of under of knowing what's

635
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,679
going on

636
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,000
um and

637
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,580
by the way so when I did this from a

638
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,500
scientific perspective I actually took a

639
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,140
cognitive test out in the parking lot

640
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,200
then I went in and did the uh sensory

641
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,179
deprivation and then I came out and

642
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:30,720
retook uh the same tests obviously

643
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,400
different questions and there was a

644
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,860
there was a significant increase in my

645
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,679
in my uh scores

646
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,840
very anecdotal but I thought it was an

647
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,918
interesting thing to do yeah

648
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,400
right yeah exactly so why do I bring

649
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,980
this up uh this is a

650
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,220
p-tech effectively or a methodology that

651
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,559
gets us to similar if not the same sorts

652
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:56,700
of States

653
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,240
um in fact there are stories of uh like

654
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,460
expert meditators uh uh I don't know

655
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,020
what you're calling but the folks that

656
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,580
have reached those enlightened States

657
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,039
and those those

658
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,440
more removed kind of Concepts that have

659
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,200
that they put into these tanks and um

660
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,059
their experiences have been off the

661
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:16,559
charts it's one of those things they

662
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,419
like I want one of these and I put it in

663
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:21,539
my house like it's it's a uh so clearly

664
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:25,020
that is uh halfway legitimate thing

665
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,460
right so what are some of the other

666
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,039
things uh breathing techniques so we did

667
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,020
some breathing here but there's all

668
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,159
sorts of different kinds of breathing

669
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,419
techniques there's some that are much

670
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:35,580
much more active of each one of the

671
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,559
techniques off the off of the top

672
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,419
there's hyperventilation and

673
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,640
hypoventilation Cycles I mean there's

674
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,360
there's uh uh what's the I forget what

675
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,260
it's called there's a there's a

676
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,580
breathing technique that's very active

677
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,020
that takes you to a hallucinogen state

678
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,360
so breathing is a big thing cold and

679
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,940
heat exposure you know sitting yourself

680
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,220
in a nice bath sitting yourself in a

681
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,159
sauna those are also the the types of

682
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,539
things that people use to get into

683
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:05,640
certain mind States

684
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,299
um nutrition nootropics

685
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:11,159
Pharmaceuticals psychedelics right those

686
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,320
are other things and these all at least

687
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,720
in some big way fall into the idea of

688
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,320
tech right things that were were using

689
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,299
that aren't meditation to try to achieve

690
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,159
the same sort of thing

691
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:25,740
sound and light and then we just did

692
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,779
some biofeedback right so biofeedback's

693
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:29,100
another one and another piece of

694
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,260
biofeedback that we you didn't see is

695
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:35,360
you know like the uh brain waves uh

696
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,039
yes thank you the brainwave the

697
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,620
brainwave uh monitoring and and those

698
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,000
are used and she and she can tell you

699
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,860
right those are used in many ways not

700
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,899
not the least of which is is trying to

701
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:48,620
find certain States

702
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:50,520
okay now I want to move on has anyone

703
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,080
here

704
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,220
heard of tdcs

705
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,440
tdcs nice so

706
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,059
the reason I bring this up and I'm going

707
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,020
to tell you what it is here in a second

708
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,700
so we just talked about biofeedback

709
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,460
which is sort of a monitoring of your

710
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,000
body's uh condition but what if you

711
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,980
could actively

712
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,080
influence

713
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,059
parts of your body and in this case

714
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:16,980
we're talking about the brain but you

715
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,480
could do that right

716
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,580
so let's talk about cdcs tdcs stands for

717
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:24,059
transcranial direct current stimulation

718
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:26,399
and it's an it's a really interesting

719
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,940
concept because it's got an interesting

720
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,460
history it is actually being used

721
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,440
clinically

722
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,200
um and uh for all kinds of things a lot

723
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,779
of people that have uh challenges and

724
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:41,220
they're they're trying to like relearn

725
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,740
how to do things uh I think they've

726
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,799
they're doing ADHD actually and uh DARPA

727
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,679
has used tdcs to

728
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,740
um uh they tried to use tdcs to to

729
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,740
enhance their snipers effectiveness

730
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,419
and if you're interested in that that's

731
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:58,980
really interesting because it looks like

732
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,960
it was significantly enhanced their

733
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,620
sniper's ability to do what snipers do

734
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,140
um but the other thing about tdcs is

735
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,480
it's relatively low Tech

736
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,380
low barrier entry

737
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,179
low risk and will expound on that

738
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,120
greatly here in a minute uh low risk and

739
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,000
and I mean you can build a tdcs device

740
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,360
or you can find one for low cost and in

741
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,620
fact I believe there are commercial

742
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,080
like not clinical but commercial ones

743
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,240
that you can buy so it's already kind of

744
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,380
finding its way into the commercial

745
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,200
space I bring that up because

746
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,159
uh tdcs is one of those things that had

747
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,960
a biohacker person

748
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,580
um I've gotten into I've got uh Jen's

749
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,480
gotten into and uh

750
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,179
so we've done some tdcs uh investigation

751
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,380
we've done we've done a couple of talks

752
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,600
where we talked more deeply about tdcs

753
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,260
and uh how to use it and giving people

754
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,299
you know where what it is and all that

755
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:05,580
kind of stuff and in one of those

756
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,240
uh talks we met Dr k

757
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,880
and I'm going to let Dr K actually take

758
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,980
over and and tell tell a story about

759
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,179
about that

760
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:20,820
it's 2019 right 2019 like bethcon was

761
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,100
then Defcon and I've been teaching

762
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,240
meditation

763
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,919
for you know 15 years at that point

764
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,140
I like his phone right most of you about

765
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,760
70 percent of you right got that

766
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,399
experience right away but you felt that

767
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:37,980
but the problem is if you don't practice

768
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,820
it regularly that skill dies right

769
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,039
but with some of my students it's like

770
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:46,019
riding a bicycle

771
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:48,539
once they get that experience they're

772
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,820
able to recreate it and that's the word

773
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,260
I use Awakening right Enlightenment I'm

774
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,940
not going there that's that's too

775
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,580
highball stuff for me

776
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,019
Awakening is different

777
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:03,360
we all can experience our waiting how

778
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,039
many of you were in a rotten

779
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,919
relationship and One Fine Day the bulk

780
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,080
went on

781
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,159
right

782
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,679
that's that's Awakening

783
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,780
what is it when you were struggling with

784
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,580
a tough problem and that happened right

785
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,580
and meditation is nothing bad starting

786
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,199
to observe your thoughts thoughts

787
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:25,320
thoughts to the point you realize ah

788
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,940
it's not me

789
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,820
it's my head it's my mind it's my

790
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,440
thoughts and I'm not my freaking

791
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,379
thoughts okay and it's a practice it is

792
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:36,599
a practice and so I did this right so I

793
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,099
did this for all this so I went to

794
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:39,839
Defcon the typical cyber security guy

795
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,639
looking at cyber security stuff and I

796
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,739
saw bioback hiking Village and I

797
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,239
literally thought biohacking blade I had

798
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,859
to do something with drugs and stuff

799
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:48,119
like that right

800
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,000
and I saw these this tdcs and I had

801
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,460
never heard of tvcs before that time I

802
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,219
went and it was the end of the workshop

803
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,920
but I met Jan and Jen was kind enough to

804
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,960
give me a tip and she's going to talk

805
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,040
about that kid

806
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,440
and I you know what happens after a

807
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,880
Defcon right you have all these good

808
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,160
intentions and nothing gets done and

809
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,260
then a month later I saw that kid and I

810
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,440
put it together and then I tested it up

811
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,440
I just blew my mind literally

812
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,380
I wasn't that stage the moment I felt

813
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,599
the circuit in I was that state that

814
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,839
takes me 15-20 minutes to get there

815
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:27,119
I said okay this must be you know just

816
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,680
the great food my wife cooked for me

817
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,940
because that's right eating is an

818
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,560
orgasmic experience I don't know about

819
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,720
you guys but for me

820
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,900
and so I did it again boom it came there

821
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,060
right and then I started looking at

822
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,220
literature and there are prescriptions

823
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,119
available for pdcs devices for anxiety

824
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,160
so then I called them up and we were

825
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,020
planning to come two years ago and do

826
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,119
the stock and so you are looking at two

827
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,020
years worth of stuff

828
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,000
and now I'm going to rain on everyone's

829
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
parade with the skeptic point of view no

830
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,640
um but reasonably so let me just talk

831
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,859
about tdcs a little bit

832
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:10,740
um so essentially as you heard if

833
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:15,180
using a nine volt battery to enhance the

834
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,339
way that your neurons fighter it's not

835
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:20,040
going to fire things that aren't firing

836
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,020
it's just going to enhance that or

837
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,599
depress that if that's your goal now

838
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,400
let's start with just a little bit of

839
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,720
History this is a torpedo fish one day

840
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,400
hundreds of years ago a guy accidentally

841
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,800
stepped on it and said well my goat is

842
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,960
gone I feel better

843
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,300
um you would think that that would be

844
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,000
you know something that just happens but

845
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,680
no people kept in they would take the

846
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,480
torpedo fish which has an electrical

847
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,380
charge

848
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,180
put it against their forehead to get rid

849
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,560
of headaches

850
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,200
Aristotle Plato played around with the

851
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,900
torpedo fish then we have a whole bunch

852
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,220
of History where people were playing

853
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,900
with electricity and ways they probably

854
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,000
shouldn't have

855
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
electrifying frogs dead frogs electric

856
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,359
dead people with currents with fish like

857
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,820
this with electric eels we're weird

858
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,680
human beings are really weird but this

859
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,900
is how we advance science right with

860
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,940
technology and the advanced and we

861
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,960
create batteries now so what happens is

862
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,119
this technology starts incorporating

863
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,920
into

864
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,640
real medicine so we take this anecdotal

865
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,460
information stepping on a torpedo fish

866
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,700
cures your gout or makes you feel better

867
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,640
can we validate that can we look at that

868
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,200
and see if that's really working what is

869
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,619
happening so I want to talk about how

870
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,300
it's used now in the medical community

871
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,760
and I want to also point out that the

872
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,940
medical community the clinical

873
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,220
experimentation studies are driven by

874
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,339
people who have their own incentives the

875
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:56,339
pharmaceutical companies the um the

876
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:58,859
grant funding of they want to make money

877
00:37:58,859 --> 00:37:59,940
essentially

878
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,760
so I want to point out the role of

879
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,800
hackers and citizen science because this

880
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,140
is something I'm very passionate about

881
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,960
we are not pharmaceutical companies we

882
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,359
don't care about the same things

883
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:15,660
we care about how it's going to help us

884
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,040
specifically

885
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,740
so Dr K believes that TCS can help with

886
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,079
Enlightenment and meditation

887
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,500
all right great let's take the anecdotal

888
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,300
evidence go back to Middle School where

889
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,920
we learned about the scientific method

890
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,260
and apply it and see what we can find

891
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,020
out turn it into something that we can

892
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,760
can examine and really look into this is

893
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,020
really important because the hacker

894
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,320
mentality is critical here we are such

895
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,599
Brilliant Minds in this room where we

896
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,540
can think of different things to to test

897
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,220
that the medical community is not going

898
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,440
to tell us so I'm battling now just to

899
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,960
be clear just to be clear that's a lot

900
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,480
of words to say Dr K you're full of crap

901
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,900
I didn't want to say it but no

902
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,760
so yeah let's examine that I'm not going

903
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,980
to go over the scientific method but I

904
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,079
I'm a doctoral candidate right now I

905
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,180
can't just say I think it works because

906
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,520
it worked for me I have to prove exactly

907
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,300
why it works and we do that by trying to

908
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,920
prove that it doesn't work

909
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,180
so before we go into the meat of this I

910
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,800
want to talk about some safety yeah I

911
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,880
think because we might be a little bit

912
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,460
out of order but that's fine but you

913
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,079
know safety is important it's always an

914
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:32,880
afterthought but let's just talk about

915
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,740
it real quick

916
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,900
it's an angle battery is not going to

917
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,800
kill you

918
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,980
unless you're a dumbass don't be a

919
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,099
dumbass you will win a Darwin Award such

920
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:47,820
as a a Navy Navy sailor when to take a

921
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,760
multimeter plugged it into his body I

922
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,800
don't know if you know this or not but

923
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,160
um internal resistance we are meat sacks

924
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,300
of liquid salts and that's conductive if

925
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,880
you're using a 9 volt battery outside of

926
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,079
your body it's not going to kill you

927
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,060
inside your body it's going to kill you

928
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,940
so if you're using a tdcs device

929
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,040
don't inject it into your body don't

930
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,380
don't put probes into your body this is

931
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,940
external only

932
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,000
don't be a dummy some side effects It's

933
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,339
relatively safe you might want to you

934
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:22,260
know ask your doctor before doing it if

935
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,780
you have epilepsy or um you know

936
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,240
that but don't be a dumber essentially

937
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,060
when I'm from using Okay so

938
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,720
we have this concept with tdcs that it

939
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,760
might be able to enhance cognitive

940
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,920
performance in

941
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,480
and

942
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,240
we had this Theory so what we did

943
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,520
scientific method citizen scientists

944
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,220
tried to disprove this can we show that

945
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,280
it doesn't enhance cognitive performance

946
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,680
so we did a study and what you're

947
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,920
looking at here is our evidence that

948
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,660
maybe it it is applicable to enhancing

949
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,760
cognitive performance and we have

950
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,760
statistically significantly shown that

951
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,099
it did in our study this is a small

952
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,619
study but it pushes science forward it

953
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:13,560
uses technology it uses our own research

954
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,560
so others can repeat it others can try

955
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,920
to repudiate it now putting this all

956
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,820
together

957
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,000
Dr Kate believes tdcs can enhance my

958
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,900
best

959
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,140
so let's talk about that we're taking a

960
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,640
scientific approach

961
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,380
to

962
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:33,540
telling him he's wrong exactly exactly

963
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,000
so I did want to jump back really quick

964
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,220
to a point you made about uh like the

965
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,380
current state of clinical use of this

966
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,760
technology

967
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,760
um it's it's I think it's fairly well

968
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,400
established it's uh legitimacy I think

969
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,560
there's it's not why you use there are

970
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,980
definitely some uh some docs that are uh

971
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,720
really fans of it and there are people

972
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,359
that that poo poo it and just under

973
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,700
that's understandable right but but back

974
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,079
to

975
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:04,500
when would you expect to see a clinical

976
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,320
use of this to enhance meditation well

977
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,480
it's never going to come from the big

978
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,920
clinics because they're trying number

979
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,119
one they're trying to solve real problem

980
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:14,460
like real problems uh number two there's

981
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,440
no money in making making you feel

982
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,200
better uh through meditation and so you

983
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,820
might at some point in the game you

984
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,839
might start seeing commercial

985
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,940
applications you might see uh consumer

986
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,220
versions of it out there that make these

987
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,720
claims

988
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,420
um but do they have any sort of signs to

989
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,579
back it up not at this point at least

990
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:34,200
and that's what we're that's what we're

991
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,540
uh interested in doing so we've crafted

992
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,520
a study

993
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,579
it's uh uh you know we're with the

994
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:44,400
intent to approach uh scientific as much

995
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,260
scientific rigor as we can apply to it

996
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,960
and and noting the

997
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,440
um elements where it's not entirely uh

998
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,660
as as perfect as it could be because

999
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,520
we're not we're not scientists we're not

1000
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,520
in a clinic or you know um so this is a

1001
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,400
self-administered uh uh like

1002
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,900
questionnaire program it's a

1003
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,140
self-administered program self uh uh the

1004
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,599
data is compiled by by the folks that

1005
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,760
are that are doing the study

1006
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,140
um and then at the end of it obviously

1007
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,700
we'll bring it all together and see what

1008
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,260
and see what we find out

1009
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,700
um and that's pretty much all there is

1010
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,040
to it I guess what I would say is part

1011
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,420
of the reason we're talking about it is

1012
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,500
we're looking for folks that are

1013
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,180
interested in doing that

1014
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,619
um there's a guy right here so there we

1015
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:28,200
go yeah um and and what I'll say about

1016
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,480
the device so um there's multiple ways

1017
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,560
in which you can make uh find get we

1018
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,140
have some I'm not trying to be a

1019
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,520
Salesman necessarily but we have

1020
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,680
somebody who would sell you

1021
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,079
um we can also there's uh we've got a

1022
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,660
website that uh talks about how to build

1023
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,880
one there's other resources of people

1024
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,859
that have built them

1025
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:53,339
um uh and I think that's mostly how I

1026
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,520
need to do is say

1027
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,079
achieving homes through homes that's a

1028
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,440
pretty cool study yeah

1029
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,619
and by the way

1030
00:44:03,619 --> 00:44:05,940
you listen there's no hypothesis yet

1031
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,260
here but I think I mean I think you

1032
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,300
understand what the hypothesis is like

1033
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,760
I think is wrong yeah that's a pretty

1034
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,079
much what that I promise it's going to

1035
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:14,640
be and then see if we can prove that uh

1036
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,099
to the contrary so

1037
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:18,540
um we'd like to get people that are

1038
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,980
interested in doing it we're going to do

1039
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:23,460
it ourselves uh as as subjects um but

1040
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,140
the more folks obviously we can get

1041
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,140
involved the bigger the the data set uh

1042
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,819
the more interesting interesting the

1043
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:32,640
results obviously

1044
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,619
um and

1045
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:36,300
how how do you get involved it's really

1046
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,099
going to come down to uh reaching out to

1047

questions but there's still a section

1058
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,500

00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,579
scientifically as Citizens as hackers as

1062
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:15,000
citizen scientists so I'm excited to

1063
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,040
have this community be a part of that

1064
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,540
yeah so we're going to open up for

1065
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,680
questions for a little bit but also

1066
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,839
stick around because as prep for the

1067
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,700
next talk uh we're going to do one more

1068
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,579
of Dr K's uh this is the energizing

1069
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:28,740
exercises to try you know get yourself

1070
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,300
prepared for the rest of the day so

1071
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,819
anyone have any questions questions yes

1072
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:35,060
sir what was the sample size

1073
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:38,400
so the sample size was two people but

1074
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,040
the the time was

1075
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,380
several weeks there were enough data

1076
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,819
points to be able to show it

1077
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:46,859
statistically significant but it wasn't

1078
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:49,740
n equals to study which is something

1079
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,720
that is interesting enough to have

1080
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,880
others repeat it in a larger space it's

1081
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,400
not definitive

1082
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,680
I would not go and tell somebody that we

1083
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,440
we proved something solidly this is just

1084
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,060
a way to say this is interesting maybe

1085
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,560
we should do not work

1086
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,339
any other questions

1087
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,540
did that answer your question yeah okay

1088
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,560
great

1089
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,200
okay

1090
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,660
just real quick I know we we had the

1091
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,280
three archetypes the believer the secret

1092
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,740
is skeptic as you go through this next

1093
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,200
short phase here before the rest of the

1094
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,520
conference

1095
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,339
um try to be open to all three of those

1096
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:29,160
and analyze it from contractors when I

1097
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,420
said a skeptic mindset

1098
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:45,920
there we go

1099
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:52,440
okay so here I'm gonna play the other

1100
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,260
side right meditation always is about

1101
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,900
chilling out and relaxing and come out

1102
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,460
of a stressful day I got

1103
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:05,160
a confession to make

1104
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,680
from I

1105
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,700
tend to have panic attacks and anxiety

1106
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,859
attacks right

1107
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:16,560
I'm scared of heights

1108
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,760
and what did I do I lost one I was in

1109
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,540
Florida I went to a lighthouse

1110
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:27,960
200 steps right I walked to the first

1111
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,339
hundred steps

1112
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:32,640
and I have an anxiety attack

1113
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,819
right brain does only two things and

1114
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,560
it's on a pairing attack

1115
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,680
fight or free

1116
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,920
meditation offers us the Third

1117
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,140
I stood for a few minutes and I'm going

1118
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,819
to teach you the same breathing exercise

1119
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:50,760
and this isn't that page if you go to my

1120
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,480
blog it'll be there it's called

1121
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,660
okay

1122
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,839
it's called beating test anxiety it's

1123
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:02,280
beating anxiety

1124
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,160
okay here's the magic thing that people

1125
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,260
don't tell us there's a difference

1126
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,640
between emotions and feelings okay go

1127
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,680
back put this together put your fist

1128
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,880
together again

1129
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,800
this is your brain put it together help

1130
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,780
me you Mommy here because it's gonna

1131
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,339
help you later

1132
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:22,920
this comes is our Olympic system

1133
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,040
emotions come here when you are anxiety

1134
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,819
it's real your body injects all kinds of

1135
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:32,839
chemicals in your body and you feel that

1136
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,180
for me when I was with that 200 100 step

1137
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,640
my heart was beating I could feel that

1138
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,760
heartbeat and my body was telling me run

1139
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,460
back you sucker you're gonna die when

1140
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:48,420
you reach the top right and all I did

1141
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,060
was and this is the magic right

1142
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,680
for two minutes

1143
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,440
that's all you can use your watch two

1144
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,300
minutes I Stood Still

1145
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,460
and I washed my dreams

1146
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,260
okay and there's a particular style of

1147
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,300
breathing that's being made Popular by

1148
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,040
Navy Seals there are two kinds one is

1149
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,960
called the Box breathing and one is

1150
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,260
called the 4-6 breathing so I want you

1151
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,540
all to put your palms in your belly

1152
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:15,780
and just follow that cycle inhale

1153
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,040
exhale

1154
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,619
[Music]

1155
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:23,480
I'm going to do this just for one minute

1156
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:26,880
and the goal is not to feel relaxed the

1157
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,040
goal is to be aware of your body

1158
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,619
[Music]

1159
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,640
pretty easy to follow right anybody have

1160
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,839
trouble following those instructions

1161
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:05,400
okay so that's one minute how many of

1162
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,560
you feel relaxed already raise your

1163
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,579
hands

1164
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:10,500
okay about 25 percent of you right I

1165
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,300
want all of you to stand up now

1166
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,339
okay how many of you deal with anxiety

1167
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:16,859
and depression some sort raise your

1168
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:18,000
hands

1169
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,359
almost all of us right Michelle bounce

1170
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,220
you deal with that so go ahead

1171
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,319
so next time you do this right and

1172
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:26,339
you're in the middle of the meeting with

1173
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:27,480
your boss you're having an anxiety

1174
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,940
attack say hey I gotta do this Dr Keith

1175
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,640
taught me this is that deal okay put

1176
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,700
your put your inhalation finger okay

1177
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,240
inhale

1178
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,800
long exhale through blow like you're

1179
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,520
blowing your candle

1180
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,500
inhale fast inhale

1181
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,280
exhale

1182
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,420
now remember the blowing through the

1183
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,880
mouth along is very important part okay

1184
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,500
that's what triggers that relaxation

1185
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,480
okay one more time inhale

1186
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,599
inhale

1187
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,099
exhale long exhale

1188
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,759
inhale

1189
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,420
exhale

1190
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,900
so this is the key right the nice thing

1191
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,079
about this is you can learn it fairly

1192
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:27,180
quickly and you don't have to be perfect

1193
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,099
the only thing you have to remember is

1194
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:31,500
to inhale through your nose fairly

1195
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,520
rapidly

1196
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,640
and exhale glowing like a candle but

1197
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,260
slow and long

1198
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,480
that's the easiest one you can do can

1199
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,280
you find him can you put this app in

1200
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,859
your phone absolutely now how do I use

1201
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:47,579
this right I get test anxiety right and

1202
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:50,940
I'm doing my cssp or all that right so

1203
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,700
when I practice my quiz every 20

1204
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,900
questions I do a two minute break

1205
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,760
and if you have done

1206
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,040
CISD or any other exam

1207
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,500
if you keep a good face you can reach

1208
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,420
those 150 questions and whatever your

1209
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,800
time is it

1210
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,240
Here's the Clincher for you I'm not

1211
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,700
promising all of you I got my CRS be

1212
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,319
done in 100 questions

1213
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:17,220
right and I think 25 percent loss I was

1214
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,160
calmer than other people thanks to panic

1215
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,280
right so this is the key thing so what

1216
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,900
we're going to do is just five breaths

1217
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,780
each they're going to do cycles of five

1218
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,059
breaths you got two minutes to go okay

1219
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:32,339
we'll get this done in two minutes how's

1220
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:36,180
that okay so inhale exhale sit

1221
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,160
comfortably

1222
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,579
feedback of and we're gonna get done in

1223
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:43,559
two minutes

1224
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:48,359
so first breath cycle focus on your body

1225
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:51,359
if there's any sense of anxiety Breathe

1226
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,598
It Up

1227
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:55,740
hold

1228
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,339
inhale

1229
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,400
hold and you don't have to be perfect

1230
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,839
with this this is called a box spring

1231
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:07,819
this is what the name seems use it

1232
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,980
okay the next five Cycles just focus on

1233
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,420
your breath

1234
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,700
five Cycles just focus on your breath

1235
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:22,220
have thoughts coming just let them go

1236
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,540
if you want to do this in your with your

1237
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,460
eyes closed you can just use it four

1238
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,119
times yeah you can use

1239
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:35,240
the eyes

1240
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,400
now the last five Cycles I want you to

1241
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,960
pick out the word that you want

1242
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,420
confidence

1243
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,099
compassion whatever you want

1244
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,099
to pick that

1245
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:53,880
and literally inhale those stripes

1246
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,000

1247
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,579
and this is all you're doing with this

1248
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:02,579
exercise is that whatever that anxiety

1249
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:05,160
attacks that's emotion right

1250
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,800
you give it two minutes to dissipate

1251
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,440
and then you put in you examine your

1252
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,559
feet
