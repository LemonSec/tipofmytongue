59
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,159
where are you someone up here to tell us

60
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,140
about passenger

61
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,780
okay so this year

62
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,780
um we we had one other contest

63
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,060
previously here at cyphercon

64
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,560
um and I had identified a couple issues

65
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,420
with it that a lot of people had

66
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,940
problems with and and while I'm sitting

67
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,860
in the booth I had a bunch of people

68
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,599
come up to me just trying to get a

69
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,819
password cracking environment running on

70
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,319
their machines

71
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,060
um that was the majority of what I spent

72
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,459
my time doing at the con last time and

73
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,200
so obviously that was an issue that I

74
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,099
needed to fix so this year I designed a

75
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,858
way for individuals to walk up whether

76
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,380
their computer or a thin client and do

77
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,238
all of their password cracking directly

78
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:22,740
in the browser all you needed was a

79
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,840
browser you get yourself a graphics card

80
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,020
and you go to town which was pretty cool

81
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,400
um worked pretty good I had a couple

82
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,740
hiccups in the beginning but that worked

83
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,320
awesome and it was very well received so

84
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,419
I am happy that all functions

85
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,720
um the contest itself uh when without

86
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,600
any issues which is great great planning

87
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,639
on our part and love it because it's a

88
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,639
pain to fix afterwards

89
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,580
so I have some some stats here from the

90
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,940
actual contest itself

91
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,400
last contest we had a single team that

92
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,919
submitted an obnoxious amount of plain

93
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,900
texts that were duplicates

94
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,360
I'm really really glad that we thought

95
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,639
ahead and took care of that because we

96
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,560
would not have enough compute to sustain

97
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,780
what was going on this year is

98
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,020
absolutely no different

99
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,600
we have one single team that submitted

100
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,240
about 50 of all submissions and that was

101
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,720
about uh 60 million hashes that they

102
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,479
pushed to our our server so that was

103
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,880
pretty uh nice to see that our Forward

104
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,259
Thinking with the server was working

105
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,320
well so that's cool can't uh nice nice

106
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,440
props for that as far as who wins stuff

107
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,180
in the Pro section is anyone from

108
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,860
hashmob here

109
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,759
thank you

110
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,120
no pass mob okay all right well hashmob

111
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,460
took first in the Pro section

112
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,060
um that section is literally us just

113
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,120
absolutely destroying you

114
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,400
um that is that is a uh that is a

115
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,479
difficult one

116
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,919
um but I'm more interested in this free

117
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,199
stuff uh the pro team is really just us

118
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,780
messing with uh our colleagues that we

119
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,840
do contests with um I.E team right

120
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,160
um so I mean that's basically what it is

121
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,320
like we just screw with you guys because

122
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,940
you beat us almost every year and

123
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,479
cracked me if you can so yeah well train

124
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,660
you to do better exactly

125
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,280
um so the street teams

126
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,440
um last year we had an individual that

127
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,300
absolutely blew us away

128
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,600
um because he was a single person on one

129
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,620
single uh cracking rig and

130
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,520
um he won last time and this year's no

131
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,539
different

132
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,460
um toil absolutely murdered the

133
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,460
competition if uh you could come up here

134
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,540
buddy I'd appreciate it

135
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,799
[Applause]

136
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,479
he's absolutely impressive he's going up

137
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,520
against teams that are 20 plus people

138
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,819
that have 20 plus GPU cracking Rigs and

139
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,340
he's taken this on completely so long

140
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,580
um so I am genuinely impressed with the

141
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,500
stuff that this guy does

142
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,240

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,259
wasn't lines your graphics processing

151

155
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,319

156
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,860
back in the day I had 28 of them and I

157

Espionage Village I was running my own

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,660
contest this year and so I wanted to

197
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,140
thank the 26 participants who figured

198
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,060
out the cipher it was a simple

199
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,820
substitution Cipher I also wanted to

200
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,920
thank all 26 of those participants for

201
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,420
giving me a taste of my own medicine

202
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,279
because I had to decipher your names

203
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,380
that you wrote down

204
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,200
in the little bag here

205
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,980
so I also realized I shot myself in the

206
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,040
foot because I made the message that she

207
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,040
decoded so cool that everyone turned it

208
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,500
in and was like all right so now when do

first one so uh

237
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,640
um I just dove in I think that a lot of

238
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,779
the myths

239
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,100
there's a lot of Mythology around

240
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,720
hacking and everything and one of the

241
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,519
things that people don't realize is that

242
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,380
it takes a heck of a lot of persistence

243
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,940
like it if you're really going to act

244
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,260
through something you can spend like a

245
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,760
couple months just to get like one

246
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,440
little answer and that's what like

247
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,360
yesterday was all day that's all I did

248
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,820
was just try to figure out the letters

249
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,140
and rearrange them and everything so

250
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,519
it's a good experience

251
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,800
[Applause]

252
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,440
great all right next up we have Chris

253
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,560
from the ocean Village Chris and Chris

254
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,560
okay

255
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,079
once again I'm not schizophrenic my

256
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,760
wife's name is Chris and she helps me

257
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,180
with the contest all right so well

258
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,220
actually she runs the contest and I just

259
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,500
take all the credit so

260
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,459
um and as I said right uh anyway just a

261
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,620
couple things about the osun CTF if

262
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,839
you're not familiar with it uh ocean is

263
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,600
open source intelligence and so

264
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,839
basically we have two volunt Targets as

265
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,200
we call them uh who who offer up their

266
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,740
lives for us to stalk online and the

267
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,300
contestants go out and try to find

268
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,579
specific pieces of information about

269
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:03,420
each

270
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,660
On Target and the more information they

271
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,639
find the more points they get and all

272
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,740
that kind of stuff the contests lasts

273
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,260
about three hours so uh so it's kind of

274
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,300
a feverish search across the internet

275
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,420
for information we do this contest for

276
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,600
awareness around how much information is

277
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,000
really out there about all of us and

278
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,980
usually our bond targets are in the

279
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,440
security industry so you would think it

280
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,019
would be hard to find their mother's

281
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,700
maiden name or sensitive information

282
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,339
like that but believe it or not it's not

283
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,160
as hard as you think so it's kind of

284
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,360
raise that awareness

285
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,100
um 30 different flags about two

286
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,380
different balling targets

287
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,639
um and um

288
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,720
and we had 30 teams signed up now

289
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,300
there's no restriction on the number of

290
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,060
people you can have time

291
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,040
we might be changing that next year

292
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,920
let's see about that but or you could

293
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,480
just play individually which is

294
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,399
perfectly fine but but there were over

295
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,160
30 teams that uh participated this year

296
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,560
uh which is a great turnout we really

297
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,260
appreciate that uh but to the important

298
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,399
part

299
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,560
um the people who actually placed in

300
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,320

345
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,940
all the answers who worked on The Cypher

346
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,360
Forest

347
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,220
well first let me apologize

348
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,880
we apologize to those who um kind of

349
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,380
discovered a couple of the mistakes so

350
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,240
you know in old game show fashion we

351
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,060
 it up

352
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,980
and now I hand all the answers back to

353
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,759
you you can go see that gentleman

354
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,319
so we also had our regular contest

355
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,119
who worked on that

356
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,359
all four of you oh thanks no we had

357
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,559
about 33-ish people come up to our table

358
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:18,299
and uh I'm a little disappointed because

359
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,520
the last ciphercon because I'm very

360
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,859
careful not to say last year the last

361
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,160
Cipher Khan we had like 83 people come

362
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,959
up and I just kind of have a feeling

363
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,240
it's a lot of you noobs couldn't get

364
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,780
past the first gated uh Cipher in the

365
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,740
program

366
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,960
but a lot of you did try and we give you

367
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,120
guys a lot of credit for that and if you

368
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,980
did decode it one of the things you had

369
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,880
to do was find who our guest of honor is

370
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,980
and traditionally while somebody was a

371
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,840
little annoyed about this

372
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,460
um traditionally I guess of honor is

373
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,340
deceased there's somebody historic in

374
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,840
computer science so we're not going to

375
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,419
tell you who it is but Alyssa you came

376
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:58,980
up as one of the guest of honors so

377
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,160
congratulations I don't know how but

378
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,340
they could do randomly so good for you

379
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,500
um so one of the other things they had

380
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,460
to do

381
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,940
was they had to make some origami write

382
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,559
their name on it and then come up to us

383
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,620
and say I eat crypto for breakfast

384
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,440
so this is the results of their hard

385
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,580
work

386
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,220
feel free to pick them up later we got a

387
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,179
lot of

388
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:28,160
got a lot of shitty origami

389
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,260
I'll take the boat hat some frogs

390
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,220
good shot

391
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,020
oh a lot of like frogs the frogs are

392
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,220
cool

393
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,840
um I think the shittiest one was

394
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,940
basically

395
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,460
a piece of corrugated paper which is

396
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,679
like a business card with a QR code

397
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,039
one of my favorites somebody made a box

398
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,919
one person made a box and they wrote

399
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,620
their name Rick so they rick rolled the

400
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,620
origami

401
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,539
I didn't come up with that

402
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,240
but the favor right overall voted

403
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,919
favorite

404
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:12,419
light

405
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,340
leaks

406
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,039
yeah she made this like is this a tulip

407
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,120
or a

408
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,120
calla lily my wife's favorite flower how

409
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,860
did you know this is what we thought was

410
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,419
like the best so we're gonna keep this

411
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,520
one because it actually shows a lot of

412
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,820
skill and artistic Beauty right

413
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,039
so good for you we wish we had a prize

414
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:37,039
but we don't so the product

415
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,280
that was very spontaneous because the

416
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,059
way this was going to go down was

417
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,840
we had

418
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,679

that's awesome you sat here for so long

423
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,220
and you tried so hard and I knew you

424
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,539

first time that we've ever had a hacker

429
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,679
black baggage for origami so yeah

430
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,720

that you'd never come back

437
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:53,259
[Applause]

438
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,760
so this is how it was going to go down

439
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,679
for those of you who tried and have

440
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,360
never done these kinds of puzzles before

441
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,880
we do offer you a round of applause and

442
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,919
your appreciation for your efforts so

443
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,460
let's give them

444
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,660
if there's a part

445
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,480
and we try to make it easier we wanted

446
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,780
it to be a two-day type of challenge so

447
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,760
that way somebody would leave and

448
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,500
they're like man I beat that thing

449

this year we had a four-way time so same

452
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,039
four people answered the same three

453
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,440
questions and it doesn't take a genius

454
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,840
to figure that out they probably work

455
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,700
together as a team this is what you call

456
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,100
a four-way try harder yeah four-wheat

457

so let's see so Wireless ETF this year

485
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,640
there were no coins but there was a very

486
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,460
clear winner uh and to give you a little

487
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,260
bit of like taste of what there was

488
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,000
there was plenty of wireless networks so

489
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,340
there was WPA WEP uh wpa3 that was there

490
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,539
um there were plenty of foxes running

491
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,400
around there are some foxes in this room

492
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,559
that haven't been found either so good

493
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,659
luck if anybody's searching for them

494
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:13,980
um we also had challenges that were

495
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,100
outside of Wi-Fi we had uh shock collars

496
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,659
we had motion sensors we had alarm

497
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:19,799
systems

498
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,720
um and I think everybody I think all of

499
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,039
those were all sold by at least one

500
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,179
person

501
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,280
um but really the clear the clear big

502
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,860
prize was there was a light up Cube and

503
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,600
the light up Cube you had to compromise

504
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,220
the wireless network but not just stop

505
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,620
there you then had to compromise systems

506
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,539
that were in that Network then you had

507
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,580
to find you know go down the rabbit hole

508
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,919
so to say get rid access to the box and

509
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,720
then unlock the box from within by

510
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,520
controlling the door lock uh so

511
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,659
agreements I don't know if you're out

512
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:47,840
there

513
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:50,880
I don't think he's here but I know who

514
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,600
he is so uh very nice job it was really

515
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,580
impressive because that is a very hard

516
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,440
challenge because it takes not just the

517
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,360
skill of compromising Wi-Fi it doesn't

518
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,799
take just the skill of network

519
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,539
penetration testing it doesn't take just

520
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,340
the skill of application security

521
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,440
testing and then privilege escalation is

522
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,539
all those combined so it have one person

523
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:12,240
solve it is just awesome I'm really

524
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,140
happy

525
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,360
um and yeah that was about it it was

526
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,020
absolutely awesome yes

527
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,799
yeah well I mean he deserved it it was

528
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,179
absolutely incredible he did it by

529
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:27,559
himself so nice job

[Applause]

546
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,640
thanks everybody for stopping by to the

547
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,220
car hiking Village we had

548
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,500
um we had created uh well the last

549
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,500
ciphercon if you were here we couldn't

550
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,900
bring the car in couldn't get through

551
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,600
the door so we had to like not do the

552
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,980
cardigan Village unfortunately that year

553
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,179
so I was like you know what I should fix

554
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,039
that problem so I made a fake car

555
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:29,039
because we had a car simulator

556
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,620
um and it's available after the con as

557
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,860
well so if you come to me afterwards and

558
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,539
you guys want to use the car hiking

559
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,340
Village simulator later

560
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,720
um I can give you guys a code and you

561
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,100
guys can start hacking cars and stuff

562
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,380
like that after the con as well but we

563
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,140
had a few uh teams uh join us we

564
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,000
actually ran out of cars we only had

565
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,860
it's about 16 cars and we had to just

566
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,720
double people up and triple people up on

567
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,360
certain cars when it got to a point but

568
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,039
I'll go through

569
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,500
um our list unfortunately the names I

570
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,820
didn't want to give people's hacker

571
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,260
names and stuff like that away so we

572
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,779
actually just use their the card in so

573
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:06,600
each car had their own name so

574
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,000
um the team so I apologize if you were

575
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,480
on this team

576
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,580
anybody who was part of Team fuselada

577
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,159
here they're in third place

578
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,679
no okay that's fine and then we had our

579
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,620
second place was our team Coquette

580
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,580

away from yesterday and today and Josh

603
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,940
here see what I did this is a transition

604
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,220
he runs hacker History Podcast and wants

605
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,980
to talk to you and you and you and all

606
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,539
of you so please tell us more about five

607
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,760
minutes that was a fabulous transition

608
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,620
you would make a really good podcast

609
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,080
host I'm just saying all right so hi I'm

610
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,260

611
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,679
come on okay

612
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:39,659
all right so cyphercon has a podcast

613
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,940
called hacker history that I do it

614
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,059
wasn't in the program

615
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:47,580
but anyway anyway so there's a podcast

616
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,140
called The Hacker History Podcast I'd

617
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,600
honestly encourage all of you to listen

618
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,000
to it because it's fabulous and I host

619
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,980
this podcast and I jokingly tell

620
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,860
everyone I talk to that my job is to say

621
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,419
tell me your story and then I laugh at

622
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,720
your jokes and that's basically what I

623
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,000
actually do but for real I we've done

624
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,679
20ish episodes give or take I don't

625
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,360
remember the exact number and every

626
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,460
person I have asked or come on the show

627
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,940
has told me my story isn't interesting

628
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,820
they're all full of and if you

629
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,520

630

649
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,760
foreign

650
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:19,880
Service Pack three

651
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,200
so I have too many lifetime badges up

652
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,179
here I need to get rid of at least one

653
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:34,159
more

654
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,020
that should be hard

655
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,179
so

656
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,279
I've been

657
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,880
um working for the last year and a half

658
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,860
on Cipher Forest

659
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:51,140
collaborating with uh 20-ish people

660
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,460
submitting puzzles so if you would like

661
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,740
to submit puzzles in the future you can

662
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,679
help the community as a whole and add it

663
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,000
to this Collective that's going to grow

664
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,460
and grow and grow so again raise your

665
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,279
hand if you've been inside the forest

666
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,559
okay that's a lot more hands than when

667
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,539
you said it before so people are waking

668
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:10,380
