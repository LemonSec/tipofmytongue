00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,399
[Music]

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,700
thank you

3
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:29,238
[Music]

4
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,218
all right

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,460
foreign

6
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,020
welcome everybody my name is Dan Creed I

7
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,060
work in the infrastructure security

8
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,700
curve in product security assessment

9
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,560
analysis for a

10
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,020
very large social media and metaverse

11
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,520
company that shall remain nameless

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,100
thanks to our attorneys

13
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,220
now we'll Dive Right In here so

14
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,340
a conversation today and this is a

15
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,920
conversation yeah

16
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,119
not a talk so feel free to ask questions

17
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,820
afterwards and uh

18
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,860
keep in mind some questions if you have

19
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,320
them but the graphs that I have on the

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,159
screen here show the cost relative to

21
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,180
fixing bugs all vulnerabilities at the

22
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,880
heart of it are bugs

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,920
um in a shift left mentality so starting

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,899
at the coding or design phase when

25
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,340
you're Gathering requirements for the

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,780
product You're Building

27
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,840
up until after release if you follow the

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,100
Curve

29
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,219
on both graphs you'll see that you know

30
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,560
at a minimum on some estimates once you

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,300
get live in production and a bug is

32
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,239
found it costs roughly 150

33
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,459
to

34
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:15,720
640 times

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,599
as much to fix the bug after a product

36
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,000
has gone live as opposed to fixing it

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,660
during the design or even early on in

38
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,599
the implementation phase you know

39
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,180
particular company I work for we have a

40
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,980
pretty mature ecosystem

41
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,959
we estimate that we've probably driven

42
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,480
that down that cost Factor down to about

43
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,379
30 times

44
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,700
so what does it take to get there and

45
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,860
build infrastructure at scale

46
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,599
Security in this way

47
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,580
it starts really with good security life

48
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,739
cycle and vulnerability management life

49
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,379
cycle and starting to operate into a

50
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,420
shift left security mindset for those of

51
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,620
you that are new to shift left security

52
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,180
uh

53
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,160
you're moving where you're finding the

54
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,140
vulnerability where you know typically

55
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,760
after a product is live you read about

56
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,500
it in the Wall Street Journal that's

57
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,319
your exploited vulnerability to prevent

58
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,900
it and down that likes life cycle where

59
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,000
prevented is at the other end of the

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,140
spectrum

61
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,239
in that you're actually finding the bug

62
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,819
during the design phase before a single

63
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,560
line of code is written or a system is

64
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,780
deployed then you have autofond human

65
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,300
found and externally found sitting in

66
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,959
the middle of that

67
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,659
so let's start with prevented what do we

68
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:37,200
do to prevent bugs like this from

69
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,700
getting in there first we'll talk about

70
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,840
scale

71
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,060
so the scale that I'm talking about we

72
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,720
have approximately 8 million servers

73
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,299
our average Network egress traffic

74
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,080
hovers around 200 terabits per second

75
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,920
pumping a 28 000 gigabytes per second of

76
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,879
data

77
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,400
to between two and three billion users

78
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,560
so we start with a Security review

79
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,060
program that looks at things

80
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,560
comprehensively

81
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,239
starts at the design phase

82
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,620
typically with a threat model for those

83
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,659
of you who are new to threat modeling

84
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:17,880
threat model is the concept of before a

85
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,220
line of code has been written or a

86
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,260
system deployed going through and

87
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,100
identifying the risks the trust

88
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,020
boundaries and then potential

89
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,960
mitigations to that threat

90
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
this is where you get your biggest cost

91
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,979
savings from if you can find them at

92
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,199
this phase

93
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,620
I mean it's typically a null gain cost

94
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,320
or you know at most 1X because you're

95
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,820
literally designing a more secure

96
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,500
product that this bug is never going to

97
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,780
exist which ironically enough also makes

98
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,300
it the hardest to quantify because how

99
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,740
do you quantify nothing and something

100
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,040
that that never exists

101
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,040
and the other key component of that

102
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,419
would be having Baseline security

103
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,840
standards this is one area that in the

104
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,400
industry we're seeing a lot of movement

105
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,720
if you look at all the different nist

106
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,060
Frameworks and different Frameworks in

107
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,160
general that are coming into it and

108
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,660
Security in general

109
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,540
this is driven by the fact that security

110
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,060
really has been treated as a second

111
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,080
class

112
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,419
Citizen and not really an engineering

113
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:22,560
disciple

114
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,360
you'll still find many computer science

115
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,759
programs referring to

116
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,539
coding as software development and I'm

117
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,979
going to encourage everyone here it's

118
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,020
that software development it's software

119
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,199
engineering needs to be treated as an

120
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,300
engineering discipline you'll notice

121
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,900
when companies like Ford or Airbus build

122
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,180
a plane or a car that they have

123
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,479
standards that guide their Safety and

124
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,460
Security practices to ensure that they

125
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,440
have a baseline level of security

126
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,919
and software now would you put your wife

127
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,400
and children in a car or a plane that

128
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,560
was designed by a group of Engineers

129
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,900
like us who never thought about Safety

130
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,979
and Security

131
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,259
of course you wouldn't so like as

132
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,020
pervasive as software has come becoming

133
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,940
Our Lives why do we continue to build

134
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,940
software like this and this is largely a

135
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,560
problem that starts in our schooling

136
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,180
system as well very few schooling

137
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,880
systems teach threat modeling and

138
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,039
security fundamentals to the point that

139
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,600
you know if you're a computer science

140
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,979
major

141
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,620
or in school and learning programming if

142
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,780
you write code with a bug in it your

143
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,759
instructor should fail that assignment

144
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,520
and have you try again

145
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,500
um security is everybody's

146
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,740
responsibility

147
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,419
the security team that I work on we have

148
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,460
one of the most distributed models and

149
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,800
it also allows one of the important

150
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,479
things is like how do you scale your

151
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,800
program

152
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,720
we have

153
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,500
almost 80 000 employees of which

154
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,780
over forty thousand of that are software

155
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,840
developers if we didn't pass that

156
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,880
ownership and make

157
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,160
software engineering and security and

158
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,900
safety a part of that discipline we

159
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,460
would not be able to scale

160
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,560
especially given the talent shortage

161
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,800
today

162
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,479
so next on that scale you move to Auto

163
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,360
phone this is another up-and-coming area

164
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,919
that companies are getting better at

165
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,479
you're starting to see a little bit of

166
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,240
an emergence of AI in

167
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,979
um

168
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,639
within our company at every single diff

169
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,560
that is submitted we do lending we do

170
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,919
static and dynamic analysis tool we have

171
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,720
the capabilities of fussing and unit

172
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,319
testing at every div as well as a manual

173
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,120
review process that comes later in the

174
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,759
pipe that we'll talk about but

175
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,440
you would be surprised at the

176
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,060
effectiveness of this program we

177
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,840
originally set out with a goal of being

178
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,060
able to automatically find or during the

179
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,840
design phase 50 of the vulnerabilities

180
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,099
now we have approximately on average a

181
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,639
hundred and fourteen thousand

182
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,620
commits every single month

183
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,840
to our code base

184
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,840
of that we are now at the point where

185
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,819
we're actually changing our metrics

186
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,259
around a bit because we're finally to

187
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,000
the point where we're exceeding on a

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,060
regular basis that 50 Mark to put this

189
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,740
in perspective

190
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,539
in the last half of 2021 we found

191
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:32,179
approximately 10 000 bugs of which uh

192
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,520
6880 were automatically found by our

193
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,500
linking and fussing with the remaining

194
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,279
being found during our human and very

195
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,260
small amount of fun that actually made

196
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,779
it through that process

197
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,420
our

198
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,160
static and dynamic analysis tools we

199
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,080
built from the ground up their purpose

200
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,040
built for our social networking company

201
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,279
and recently Pisa

202
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,580
which is the static analysis tool that

203
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,620
we use for

204
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,220
python static analysis actually won an

205
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,360
award from the IEEE

206
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,540
next as we progress down the stack we

207
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,700
move into different views and code

208
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,459
reviews at the human found phase like

209
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,080
now this is where it starts to get

210
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,540
expensive once you get into the human

211
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,540
phone I mean in an average company

212
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,959
you're looking at a 30 to 40 times

213
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,060
increase in the cost to repair that bug

214
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,339
because at this point code has been

215
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,920
written systems have been deployed and

216
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,540
for all intents and purposes the bug

217
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,700
exists and it will either end up being

218
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,760
found by a human it'll be unfound which

219
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,220
is on the rise or it will be exploited

220
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,040
later in life at which point the cost

221
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,279
really explodes

222
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,560
um as part of our diff review process

223
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,839
after all of the automation goes on

224
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,660
every diff is then sent into a queue

225
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,360
then as I said we have over 40 000

226
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,700
developers that a second set of eyes

227
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,700
must review that dish and improve that

228
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,800
that this has been reviewed and cleared

229
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,839
the land at which point then it's sent

230
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,000
to the central repository and

231
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,740
distributed to our Fleet of servers

232
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,300
externally found now we're getting into

233
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,459
really dangerous territory because now

234
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,220
the product is actually accessible to

235
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,480
the world

236
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,180
in this we have a private bug Bounty

237
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,140
program

238
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,100
again I would encourage companies to do

239
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,120
there are a couple of vendors here as

240
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,459
well that offer this kind of service in

241
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,300
which

242
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,240
with your private bug Bounty you're

243
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,579
essentially paying a select group of

244
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,700
people to

245
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,100
basically operate as a hacker from an

246
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,339
outside similar to a public bug Bounty

247
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:59,700
but this one private and our red team as

248
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,760
well red teaming if you don't know the

249
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,160
difference between a red team and a pen

250
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,260
Test please come see me after the

251
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,000
session and let's have a talk

252
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,579
there are two very different things and

253
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,040
it's one of those

254
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,620
all Bourbons are whiskey but not all

255
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,980
whiskeys are Bourbons kind of thing

256
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,200
um and our red team focuses on

257
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,459
everything we're in the unique position

258
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:26,820
that we manufacture a lot of our own

259
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,740
Hardware in the data center

260
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,320
as well as the operating system in which

261
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,600
our switches and our core infrastructure

262
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,519
Network gear runs on

263
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,579
so we have to have a very comprehensive

264
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,360
red team that can cover both most

265
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,200
recently we had one person that was

266
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,399
desoldering the chip off of a

267
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,500
programmable logic controller in one of

268
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,480
the HVAC units in a Data Center and

269
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,279
intercepting the firmware and decrypting

270
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,360
it and

271
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,240
supplanting it with a malicious firmware

272
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,820
to on the appsec side of things having

273
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,100
people who are well deeply encode

274
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,540
including where we have a particularly

275
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,399
steep learning curve because a lot of

276
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,560
our stuff was bespoke and written before

277
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,100
things like kubernetes existed

278
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,440
so our containerization is all custom

279
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,800
unfound

280
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,339
unfound it's interesting to look at the

281
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,680
increase in the number of unfound bugs

282
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,420
especially at the hardware layer which

283
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,160
is really tricky that it popped up I'm

284
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,839
sure many of you have heard of things

285
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,740
like specter and a large number of CPU

286
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,180
vulnerabilities have been found

287
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,820
including ones that existed in CPUs for

288
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,720
I think five ten years

289
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,740
you know

290
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,399
generally unfound you know are those

291
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,320
ones that you hope won't bite you but

292
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,300
you never know and you know I use

293
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,100
Specter and meltdown as as Prime

294
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,959
examples of how these can bite you in

295
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,180
the past and like

296
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,480
amen General like I said with hard work

297
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,120
it's really tricky because it could be

298
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,420
anything from you know where hopefully

299
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,519
you have a program of a logic controller

300
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,440
Asic that makes things easy but that's

301
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,880
not always the case and sometimes it's

302
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,399
baked into the rust silicon

303
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,399
so to combat some of the unfound I found

304
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,079
it effective to set up code walking

305
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,320
programs in which you set up small

306
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,720
rewards

307
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,800
for your

308
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,220
software Engineers you know to take a

309
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,959
certain amount of time and allow for a

310
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,459
certain amount of time a week to go

311
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:36,959
through randomly and walk through

312
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,600
various pieces of code as well as

313
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,880
setting up specific targets of some and

314
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,740
prioritizing like your top

315
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,860
risky things in small bite-sized chunks

316
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,079
and asking people you know kind of

317
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,360
having a Target Hit List to do code

318
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,200
walking through

319
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,560
exploited these are the ones that make

320
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,660
the

321
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,060
times in the Wall Street Journal and

322
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,860
these are the ones who do not want to

323
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,740
see yourself on CNN for

324
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,980
so another big area which many companies

325
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,040
put a whole lot of focus into

326
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,200
the more

327
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,420
traditional response of let's put up

328
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,180
more firewalls let's put up a laugh and

329
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,100
then they tend to substitute on incident

330
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,040
response

331
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,380
and detection which is surprising given

332
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,519
that

333
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,980
you know detection times still are

334
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,320
measured oftentimes within our industry

335
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,220
in weeks months even sometimes years

336
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,380
whenever you give a hacker More Time On

337
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,880
Target the more damage they're going to

338
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,920
do which is really surprising giving

339
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,420
ransomware

340
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,639
in the increase in the ramps ransomware

341
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,040
and what it can do

342
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,779
weren't aware of this fact you should be

343
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,199
but most ransomware attacks

344
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,720
live in the life cycle of take weeks to

345
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,000
months to actually set up so when you're

346
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,740
reading about those ransomware attacks

347
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,839
on the news it's generally not somebody

348
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,579
who got in and did something in a couple

349
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:09,779
days

350
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,180
it actually started probably weeks to

351
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,120
months ago in which a lot of lateral

352
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,980
movement points were established and

353
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,560
they worked their way into a larger part

354
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,480
of the Enterprise which in some ways

355
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,279
ties back a little bit with your ranking

356
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,120
and

357
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,980
now if your red team is not

358
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,380
objective-based they should be typical

359
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,540
tactic for our red team would be to set

360
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,760
them up with a specific goal in mind of

361
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,639
okay so our goal for this operation is

362
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,180
to get domain admin or root uh you know

363
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,639
depending on your segmentation it could

364
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,639
be scoped to the whole organization on

365
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,800
down to a specific critical group of

366
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,660
servers depending on your industry and

367
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,959
vertical

368
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,899
another big thing in the meantime to

369
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,959
detection where a lot of people fail is

370
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,320
not taking advantage of low-cost

371
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,920
human nature deception systems a lot of

372
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,959
people look at this as dirty play I can

373
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,779
assure you it's not hackers do this all

374
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,699
this all the time in social engineering

375
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:13,199
and it costs nothing

376
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,600
if your password policy is 12 characters

377
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,880
create an account with 11.

378
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,980
with the sole purpose of monitoring that

379
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,360
because if somebody's running a password

380
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,639
crack against you guess which account is

381
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,560
the first one that gets hit

382
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,560
yeah then do things that play on risk

383
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,180
versus reward

384
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,220
and you know depending what vertical

385
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,160
you're in set up a fake account for you

386
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,120
know

387
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,480
Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos or

388
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,639
somebody who when a hacker hits that

389
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,139
system

390
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:45,839
the risk versus the reward is just too

391
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,040
great that you know that they're going

392
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,259
to hit it that all it's doing at that

393
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,300
point then is super low cost and it's

394
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,519
serving as a you know virtual tripwire

395
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,560
or a land mine that goes boom hey

396
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,180
somebody's looking around at things they

397
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,459
shouldn't

398
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,860
then moving on to you know mean time to

399
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,740
response again response is measured it's

400
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,900
often really slow

401
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,699
do tabletop exercises drill your team

402
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,459
you know the military has a mantra in

403
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,079
which in

404
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,599
they train like they fight

405
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,520
so that when they fight it's automatic

406
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,260
and they don't have to think about it

407
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,359
and uh

408
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,280
you know you want to make it painful you

409
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,679
want to make it real I love getting in

410
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,080
conversations with Executives and stuff

411
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,520
on you know

412
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,559
well should I allow this pen test or

413
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,120
this red team engagement on my

414
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,640
production systems or you know during

415
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,320
the middle of the night or during the

416
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,760
business day you know when business

417
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,520
critical stuff is going on and having

418
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,320
that conversation with your executive

419
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,760
that's often talked you really think

420
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,740
that the hackers sit and ask me what

421
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,559
time it's okay to attack my systems

422
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,660
course they don't you know you have to

423
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,160
operate on the same

424
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,740
rules and parameters that they do or

425
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,039
you're setting yourself up for failure

426
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,740
so focus on responsible the last thing I

427
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,179
wanted to cover

428
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:09,059
as far as exploited bugs we also operate

429
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:12,480
a program called defense through offense

430
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,419
is geared specifically towards red team

431
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,419
and our Mark Junior security Engineers

432
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,320
to give them the opportunity to work

433
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,780
with the red team and actually learn

434
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,860
techniques tactics and procedures

435
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,260
um

436
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,520
splitting the team in half where

437
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,200
basically half will go and work with the

438
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,820
offensive side half we'll work with the

439
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,679
incident response team

440
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,720
and you'll do an objective-based

441
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,220
scenario that could start at a table

442
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,160
time tabletop exercise to a live fire

443
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,179
drill

444
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,520
that then runs them through and

445
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,980
practices from start to end an event of

446
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,980
matches the red team but coordinating

447
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,320
with that with a more realistic scenario

448
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,840
from rad team to incident recovery

449
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,520
so key points One Security is a life

450
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,620
cycle you know early Discovery does

451
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,620
lower the cost to remediation and it

452
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,080
reduces technical debt which is really

453
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,000
important when you think about it I'm

454
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,679
not sure how many software developer

455
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,080
types we have in here but like

456
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,260
show of hands who likes to work on Old

457
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,299
broken Legacy code

458
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,960
okay we got one weirdo in the back

459
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,539
you know well yeah it turns right out or

460
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,179
is right you know as opposed to you know

461
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,700
you get new students and like

462
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,179
we do a lot of hiring and like we see

463
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,980
this even in our recruiting cycles and

464
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,020
hiring like nobody wants to work on the

465
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,059
infrastructure nobody wants to work on

466
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,460
the Legacy systems they want to work on

467
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,559
the cool new metaverse they want to work

468
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,299
on the cool stuff that you know oh this

469
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:55,620
is going to be in front of my friends

470
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,820
and family and you know 2 million users

471
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,160
um early discovery of this and like

472
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,600
threat modeling and getting this stuff

473
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,280
out and getting it right in the design

474
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,600
phase

475
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,460
you know not only is it going to give

476
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,840
you a more secure product but you're

477
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,940
going to have less Tech debt

478
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,299
because you thought about it in advance

479
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,460
another topic I didn't cover about that

480
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,140
like there are common

481
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,900
factors and myths that have been

482
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,340
associated with threat modeling that

483
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,400
like I want to dispel right now one

484
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,860
you do not have to be a security expert

485
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,740
to threat model we want security you

486
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,720
know we want software Engineers people

487
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,520
who aren't traditional security to do

488
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,260
this and that's often the first thing

489
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,360
well I have a security department you

490
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,400
know that's their job you know I don't

491
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,679
need to know how to how to secure my

492
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,080
systems

493
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,419
every animal on this planet threat

494
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,460
models whether you realize it or not

495
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,679
every single one of you when you got

496
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,080
behind the wheel of a car when you lock

497
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,240
your doors at night you did a threat

498
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,419
model threat model is simply the process

499
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:02,700
of identifying a risk identifying a

500
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,039
trust boundary and coming up with a

501
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,780
mitigation to it

502
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,700
so you know

503
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,620
you lock your doors at night why do you

504
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,059
lock your doors at night because you've

505
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,160
evaluated the risk of getting robbed

506
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,360
which

507
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,820
you know okay I'm gonna get robbed how

508
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,679
can I prevent that what's the trust

509
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,380
boundary the trust boundary is door and

510
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,700
there are people on the other side of

511
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,320
the door who are nefarious and might

512
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,360
want to rob me because I've got valuable

513
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,679
stuff here

514
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,659
so what's your mitigation lock the door

515
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,280
you know and then this kind of exercise

516
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,380
threat modeling doesn't have to be heavy

517
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,880
weight and complex

518
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,700
these Frameworks like stride and active

519
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,080
and pasta

520
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,659
it's similar to Agile where if anybody

521
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,659
here has experienced like implementing a

522
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:47,600
packagitized

523
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,220
agile framework for their company like

524
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,120
ca safe or whatever you know like

525
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,400
it becomes heavyweight and bulky fast

526
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,919
because like that's like read the agile

527
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,799
Manifesto that's not what agile is agile

528
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,600
isn't something you put in a box and a

529
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,880
product and like neither is threat

530
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,320
modeling if you read the threat modeling

531
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,480
Manifesto threat modeling should be

532
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,179
designed to work with your development

533
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,039
teams and their development life cycle

534
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,960
how they develop

535
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,419
so like don't buy into this whole notion

536
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,179
that it has to be heavyweight like we

537
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,820
have plenty of threat modeling going on

538
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,980
in our very large organization that has

539
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,340
done via quit and Google doc

540
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,020
um

541
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,240
you know we're trying to get away from

542
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,740
that because it's hard to get metrics

543
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,080
out of that but it's done and it works

544
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,299
and it works for those development teams

545
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,039
it's up to us to provide them with

546
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,380
better tooling than that enables that

547
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,400
same piece of workflow

548
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,260
um a holistic security program doesn't

549
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,080
blindly rely on annual penetration tests

550
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,200
another fun show like hand questions how

551
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,760
many people out here have worked with a

552
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,120
company who solely rely on their annual

553
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,580
pen tests as being their Bellwether of

554
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,020
whether or not they're perimeters

555
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,120
appeared on

556
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,740
you know a pen test just it's good for

557
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,320
identifying deficiencies in your

558
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,880
perimeter but it's not how the real

559
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,559
world operates

560
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,940
you know

561
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,760
a hacker is not constrained by time a

562
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,000
pen test generally is

563
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,480
um you know pen tens are pen tests tend

564
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,940
to go wide and scan for a variety of

565
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,260
things

566
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,600
a real hacker doesn't you know they have

567
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,120
an objective in mind and generally that

568
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,460
objective is get into your business move

569
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,500
around your systems laterally and how do

570
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,720
I monetize this

571
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,000
yeah

572
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,500
so

573
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,159
you know having a whole life cycle and a

574
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,960
secure development life cycle like this

575
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,299
also helps reduce security

576
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,400
from being seen as an obstacle but

577
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,500
rather as a business enabler how is it a

578
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,500
business enabler what company doesn't

579
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,220
want to end up you know on CNN or in the

580
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,919
paper what company doesn't want to build

581
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,679
more secure products

582
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,380
you know Executives you see more and

583
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,539
more csos are getting a seat at the

584
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,059
board and at the executive level

585
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:20,220
because companies are sick of seeing

586
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,380
their products be poorly designed and

587
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,179
breached because someone never bothered

588
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,820
to stop and think about how could this

589
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,280
be broken and adapting more of an

590
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,200
adversarial mindset when designing it

591
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,460
this is probably the most important one

592
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,799
to me is build security into your

593
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,840
engineering culture I can't say it

594
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,520
enough it starts with our education

595
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,659
system

596
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:43,980
you know

597
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,340
I'm 48 years old when I was a kid you

598
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,039
know computers were still relatively new

599
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:53,280
what my kids can do now computers are a

600
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,500
mainstream part of their life

601
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,659
security needs to get the same way it

602
00:24:57,659 --> 00:24:59,760
should be taught in school when you're

603
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,500
in college you should be able to you

604
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,900
know specialize in it in in building a

605
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,740
product

606
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,720
just like any other engineering

607
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,820
discipline and there should be standards

608
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,520
developed for what is good software look

609
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,440
like from a Safety and Security

610
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,080
standpoint

611
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,780
lastly you know finding a vulnerability

612
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,760
for your development team fixes the

613
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,080
product today

614
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,419
teaching them to find vulnerability

615
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:27,299
fixes the products of today tomorrow in

616
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,279
the future

617
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,900
yeah

618
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,600
so why does this matter again our scale

619
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,520
is 8 million servers Network egress 222

620
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,020
terabits

621
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,080
28 000 gigabytes per second three

622
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,779
billion users 114

623
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,840
000 commits a month 847 million lines of

624
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,980
code

625
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,100
and almost 10 000 bugs in the second

626
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,500
half of 2021.

627
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,179
so imagine now trying to scale a

628
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:01,799
security program for this where you have

629
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,120
40 000 Developers

630
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:08,400
without having that Automation and that

631
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,520
design engineering culture in place just

632
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,320
think of how many security Engineers we

633
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,700
would have to hire

634
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,059
and then think of the

635
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,880
the sheer shortage of talent in even

636
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,940
finding that let alone funding that

637
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,279
so I'll pull up too I put in my notes

638
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,200
Here on a poem and I actually did a

639
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,980
little

640
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,700
math

641
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,679
behind this as well

642
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,400
so

643
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,419
let's plan a little scenario with me

644
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,580
say a vulnerability caught during the

645
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,640
design phase cost roughly 500 in

646
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,220
developer and security time

647
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,159
so from the graphs we showed earlier

648
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,140
you know the average fine finding and

649
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,299
remediating of that is variable

650
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:03,120
estimated between we'll say 1 and 40 if

651
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,100
it's copper I ever launched as much as

652
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,480
640 percent caught after the launch

653
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,460
so for us what this would have equated

654
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,580
to in the second half of 2021 is we know

655
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,740
that we found

656
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,960
6880 bugs automatically

657
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,840
that would have cost 3.4 million dollars

658
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,179
to fix

659
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,760
now if you figure that those uh went

660
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,260
through and made it to the manual phase

661
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,679
let's figure a conservative 20 times the

662
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,640
cost now you're looking at 60 69 million

663
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,080
dollars to fix

664
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,320
but now let's say that those bugs

665
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,299
weren't found until the launch of the

666
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,279
product and let's again be real

667
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,960
conservative and say a hundred time cost

668
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,260
now you're looking at 344 billion

669
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,440
dollars to fix those bugs

670
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,659
it changes the cost multiple of that

671
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,179
original 500 cost of finding it during

672
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,159
the design phase is now fifty thousand

673
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:01,760
dollars a book

674
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,840
so

675
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,140
that's the importance of

676
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,299
you know shifting left and

677
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:12,240
how we approach it in building an

678
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,880
infrastructure security program at scale

679
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,779
any questions

680
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,380
we do have some PCI requirements with

681
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,100
our Global footprint we have gdpr

682
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,340
we also have an FDC order that we have

683
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,960
to comply with

684
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,640
and uh with our F2 which is our

685
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,880
Facebook financials or Novi offerings

686
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,460
now we're starting to get more into the

687
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,020
financial realm we'll have more

688
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,360
financial compliance issues in the

689
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,159
future are you making that into your

690
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:01,140
pipeline

691
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,240
we're banking it into the pipeline where

692
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,340
we can but the compliance piece of that

693
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,340
is tough so some of that's still in work

694
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,400
and some of it's still new I mean people

695
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,340
are well aware that we did attempt to

696
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,419
start some crypto offering and it was uh

697
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:20,279
not greeted well

698
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,500
especially by the government and media

699
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,760
so

700
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,080
our financial

701
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,340
[Music]

702
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,799
peace still tends to be small on the

703
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,260
regulation side but given the growth of

704
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,700
the metaverse and you know that's really

705
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,220
going to be funded and fueled largely by

706
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,919
microtransactions

707
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,380
and more of a storefront approach I

708
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,700
would anticipate that they're probably

709
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,799
going to be more regulation around that

710
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,260
and I mean the whole metaverse and

711
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,179
business model is a whole nother

712
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:50,700
interesting conversation and like what

713
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,440
that looks like financially

714
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,020
now you had mentioned that all of your

715
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,200
code was built GameHouse before a lot of

716
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,460
extraordinating stuff are you guys

717
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,140
starting to switch to kubernetes or are

718
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,740
you still going to make change we we are

719
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,000
not our Legacy code is just so coupled

720
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,679
tightly to what we build and so

721
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,659
performant for what we need at the scale

722
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:14,520
that we're at

723
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,380
um our containerization orchestration

724
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,059
and automation uses a system called

725
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:19,200
Tupperware

726
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,820
like I said it was built before

727
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,460
kubernetes existed um but it's all

728
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,159
highly containerized so like a developer

729
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,100
in our environment can spin up a

730
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,740
container with a full copy of the repo

731
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,980
and about 45 seconds to a minute

732
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,919
and have full access to the repos that

733
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,440
they need to develop on and all

734
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,380
container and based on a timed life

735
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,020
cycle of orchestration so like

736
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,059
that Dev container will last for a

737
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:50,159
finite period of time that they specify

738
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,559
when they check it out or if there's no

739
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,539
use on it for 30 days it's automatically

740
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:57,000
destroyed so each of these developers

741
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,960
come to each of the foreign

742
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,500
the first six to eight weeks for all

743
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,840
engineers and it doesn't matter if

744
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,279
you're Zuck or if you're a new college

745
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,960
graduate and go through an engineering

746
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,460
boot camp

747
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,220
or they learn our course systems like if

748
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,960
you have the foundations of like modern

749
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,600
cloud architectures and Technologies

750
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,240
it's not too steeple learning curve it's

751
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,799
more of just learning the nuances

752
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,980
resistance is future

753
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,360
well that would help Drive the culture

754
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,440
that you guys are trying to drive in

755
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,899
order to enabled right it does it does

756
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,880
very much and like our training is very

757
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,820
robust I mean we have different within

758
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,659
different tracks different

759
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:47,820
functionalities of internal academies

760
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,799
that you can take to focus on specific

761
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,320
areas within the engineering boot camp

762
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,940
depending on what your job role and

763
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,980
interest is you can focus on a specific

764
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,539
track and

765
00:31:57,539 --> 00:31:59,760
I mean that six to eight week training

766
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,520
of course and boot camp is pretty

767
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,020
intensive

768
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,000
so maybe that's a key Point too like the

769
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,980
training that you guys offer helps

770
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,500
building culture that you need

771
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,179
it

772
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,340
does it does most definitely I mean the

773
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,899
three things that drive our culture

774
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:17,220
really is

775
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,419
I mean

776
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:21,299
the training is the training the tooling

777
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:22,799
and the process

778
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,260
I mean that's enabled that is what has

779
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,299
enabled us to scale to the sites that we

780
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,820
have without that we fall flat I work

781
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,500
for a bank and trying to be unable to

782
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:37,399
it would be enough

783
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:40,879
resistance is everything

784
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,260
yeah

785
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,080
financial and the more regulation you

786
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,980
get the more difficult yeah

787
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:53,460
but I mean some of it like I said is

788
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,159
engineering discipline like overall I'd

789
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,000
like to see the industry kind of adapt

790
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,679
a building code

791
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,779
where there's a National Building Code

792
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:05,880
for software to at least Define what

793
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,440
good looks like and then you know

794
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,140
companies could take the pieces that are

795
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,000
good and apply to them out of that and

796
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,840
then

797
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,299
you know have a variance process by

798
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:16,860
which they come up with their own code

799
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,779
and you know own sections that would

800
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,940
apply to their unique business unit or

801
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,279
products as well

802
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,200
I think there's far too little good

803
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,840
guidance out there for everyone to build

804
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,659
throughout this book and their own code

805
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,460
blueprint content

806
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,620
they do

807
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,299
they tend to focus on different things

808
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:38,100
and different aspects of their wants and

809
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,500
needs like anybody who I'm sure most of

810
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,360
you have read through at least one this

811
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,640
standard or another I mean

812
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,519
the whole military guidance and Mission

813
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,460
Readiness and like it's you can see like

814
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,200
the really good stuff in it but it's

815
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,240
also very geared towards a specific

816
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,039
audience in a specific critical

817
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,860
you know these are hard problems to

818
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,158
solve

819
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,480
D sure

820
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:16,918
I will so in general penetration testing

821
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,379
when you do your average penetration

822
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:21,540
test and like not all of them are equal

823
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,239
some are good some aren't bad but like

824
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,659
over the years I've done

825
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,820
I don't even want to guess but it's well

826
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,280
under the thousands of penetration tests

827
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,159
probably tens of thousands

828
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,679
over the years as well as many many many

829
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,020
red Communications so I know the

830
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,418
difference well we're you know with a

831
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:45,599
typical penetration test you're running

832
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,139
a lot of scanning of the perimeter and a

833
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,399
lot of web

834
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,918
stuff that's Broad and wide of where

835
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,199
like I'm going to run burp Suite um

836
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,900
and Nikita I might focus on one or two

837
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,720
areas and like my goal is to really scan

838
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,420
a list of targets or a list of

839
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,460
environments and provide you with okay

840
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,380
these are the vulnerabilities that I see

841
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,960
this is how I would get in versus

842
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,480
a red team is very much objective based

843
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,940
and focused and you know a good example

844
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,619
is we just did it around team engagement

845
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:18,960
where that was the target okay imagine

846
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,900
I'm an Insider you know I'm a contingent

847
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,820
worker I have a laptop

848
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,839
from the company and my objective is to

849
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,640
obtain domain admin

850
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,900
um the two approaches the way that you

851
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,119
handle those are very different

852
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:39,300
correcting engagement because it's with

853
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,119
a specific objective in mind is very

854
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,040
more laser focused

855
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,660
and less

856
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,660
on hey let's scan the whole perimeter

857
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:53,339
you know let's provide a wider report of

858
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:55,980
specific targets it's my target is to

859
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,420
get domain admin and it doesn't matter

860
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,920
how I do it

861
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,480
so you know you can craft up Rules of

862
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,980
Engagement on it but generally I

863
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,660
discourage companies from doing that

864
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,320
because nor do the hackers like I work

865
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,240
in an industry and for a size company

866
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,040
that like to think that we don't have

867
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,900
state leveled

868
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,020
sponsored people that have been hired by

869
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,880
the company in our organization would be

870
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,800
extremely naive I guarantee you we do

871
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,599
Google those Amazon does yeah

872
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,040
um you know anything should be fair game

873
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,160
and like

874
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,160
people in our industry tend to think of

875
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,260
Technology first because at heart we're

876
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,060
all technologists and Geeks and they

877
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,560
don't think about the psychological

878
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,900
aspects which I have an interesting

879
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,720
conversation at launched were they up

880
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,480
and coming college student

881
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,540
about the fact that I asked him Point

882
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,599
Blank so you know in the last couple of

883
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:56,400
years you've seen this huge

884
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,800
proliferation increase in ransomware and

885
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,780
fishing attacks

886
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,480
okay I asked him more in depth

887
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,280
generically but I'm going to see who

888
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,500
knows the answer to this really here at

889
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,020
least in my opinion one word what's the

890
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,619
cause of that

891
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,500
it's a Bitcoin

892
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,300
the ability to anonymize and monetize

893
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,740
anonymize your monetization of that

894
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,380
attack Factor has now made it from a

895
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,720
risk versus reward when you think of the

896
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,359
psychological effect of it of now I can

897
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:32,579
exploit a company I can blackmail them

898
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:34,800
and I don't have to worry about the

899
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,960
money being traced back to me and being

900
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,359
easy to intersect like physical currency

901
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,079
is that's really what is driven in large

902
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:45,780
the huge increase attack in ransomware

903
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,520
and you're seeing this not just in

904
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,619
ransomware but in anything that can be

905
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:51,599
monetized through an extortion type

906
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,660
attack Factor we've seen the distributed

907
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,579
denial of service attacks of you know

908
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:59,040
hey give us x amount of Bitcoin or we're

909
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,839
going to hit you with a DDOS attack and

910
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,880
bring you down to your knees to

911
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,540
ransomware to fishing adding and all

912
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,520
these prey on the whole psychological

913
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,859
aspect that we tend not to think about

914
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:13,980
it and give you another example here

915
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,560
I was working for a company and Buddy

916
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,140
calls me up and like he was in the

917
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,300
operation side of things like dude like

918
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,520
you've been doing like eunuchs a long

919
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,380
time and Linux and stuff right like

920
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,599
you've got this Linux server that's just

921
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,400
like pounded on our database I'm like

922
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,320
nobody can figure out what it is can you

923
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,060
help me track it down

924
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,339
so like immediately

925
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,440
they get a team together and this team

926
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,540
like immediately like let's get on the

927
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,640
switch let's find out the MAC address

928
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,859
let's trace the cable you know the

929
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:46,740
physical server and I'm like whoa guys

930
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,420
hold on a second like what's the name of

931
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,500
this server oh well it's like LGC Linux

932
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,780
dot I'm going to anonymize this company

933
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,420
name.com

934
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,060
um I'm like okay so like what do you

935
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,040
know from that piece of information well

936
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,540
we know the server name okay well like

937
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,460
what's your naming standard oh well we

938
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,099
use error part codes okay well what

939
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:10,800
airport code is LGC oh well that's weird

940
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,680
we don't have any location near LGC

941
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,180
okay

942
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,280
don't you think that's odd well yeah

943
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,540
they're like what do you think it means

944
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,000
okay I want you to think real long and

945
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,339
hard about this when when you write code

946
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:25,260
when you annotated

947
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,780
do you type out your full name well now

948
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,820
what use my initials

949
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,700
ah do you think that three-letter code

950
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,920
might be somebody's initials why don't

951
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,480
you check with your developers and see

952
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,940
if they have any individually initials

953
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,579
oh no we don't have any developers that

954
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,619
have those initials did you check with

955
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,180
the red team

956
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,160
no

957
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,380
hey you guys got anybody there with the

958
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,359
initials LGC

959
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:56,240
yeah Landon's initials are like LGC

960
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,020
five minutes problem solved again where

961
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,599
they wanted to dive in and like getting

962
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,339
the MAC address tracing the cable

963
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:06,839
probably would have taken them about two

964
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:09,240
hours of time that I solved the problem

965
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,339
for them in five minutes just by

966
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,260
thinking about the psychology about it

967
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,180
you know same thing like when you're

968
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,700
evaluating because it's not a matter of

969
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,339
if your system gets breached it's when

970
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:22,320
which is why I put a big focus on

971
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,660
detection

972
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,540
you know the people that you really need

973
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,400
to be scared about if you get some dude

974
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,400
in your system like hacker comes in and

975
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,560
sets up you know an access point and

976
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,500
like sets up a user account like Han

977
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,240
Solo or some you know sci-fi thing that

978
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,300
dude is in there for fun he's in there

979
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,339
to explore he's in there Kitty scripting

980
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:48,960
yes he can do some damage don't

981
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,180
underestimate that but his motivations

982
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,180
in general aren't particularly serious

983
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,460
now you have some dude who goes in there

984
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,960
and you know you have a bunch of servers

985
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,180
named

986
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,400
oh it's three oh now there's an old four

987
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,660
on here that's the do

988
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,700
because he's put the thought in it to

989
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,500
how am I going to normalize my traffic

990
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,240
how am I going to hide this how am I

991
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,400
going to be the wolf in sheep's clothing

992
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,520
as much as he possibly can he's thinking

993
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,820
about the psychology and like dude some

994
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,680
of the things are just scary so like the

995
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,540
social media company I work for and

996
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,700
stuff like gets a total bad rep about

997
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,440
this and again like people don't think

998
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,320
about this like this this blows people's

999
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,240
mind in my own family like oh my God you

1000
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,560
worked for them I heard about them on

1001
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,780
the news how can you work for that place

1002
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,240
okay dude like Mom

1003
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,760
where did you hear that information

1004
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,700
oh I heard it on TV on the news

1005
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,700
okay so you heard it on the news how

1006
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,260
does that news station

1007
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,760
you know it's owned by a television

1008
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,260
station how do they generate their

1009
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,460
Avenue

1010
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,220
well commercials well it's advertising

1011
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,980
right well yeah well who's the biggest

1012
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,480
competitor

1013
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,970
oh

1014
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,500
[Music]

1015
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,640
so you don't think that they have any

1016
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,320
bias to throw us under the bus every

1017
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,940
chance that they get of course they do

1018
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,160
it helps their bottom line

1019
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,320
you know

1020
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,540
there's so much psychology and risk

1021
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,520
versus reward for this that people don't

1022
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,800
think about in our industry that like

1023
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,839
to make all the difference in the world

1024
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,520
and how you just view and approach

1025
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,000
problem is

1026
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,560
um you know and really the nastiest

1027
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,660
nastiest case I've ever seen of like how

1028
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,520
people switch to tactics and use

1029
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,440
psychology

1030
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,380
there was a hospital system in Detroit

1031
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,460
that a group of hackers got in there

1032
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,260
compromised the electronic health record

1033
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,820
system

1034
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:48,000
and so like you know I mentioned you

1035
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,440
earlier you know the really dangerous

1036
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,000
hackers are the ones who might want to

1037
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,680
monetize this

1038
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,900
you know and like it's a good use case

1039
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,180
of like oh my god when we designed this

1040
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,520
system we never

1041
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,380
thought of how this would be abused

1042
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,819
against us

1043
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:05,160
they took the electronic medical records

1044
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,440
identified terminal patients

1045
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,900
got them hooked on drugs

1046
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,940
agreed to continue supplying with them

1047
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,859
drugs provided they would sign over a

1048
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:15,839
life insurance policy with them as the

1049
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,380
beneficiary

1050
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,339
wow

1051
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,500
people are always the weakest link you

1052
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,880
know people ask me why don't you solve

1053
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,119
the cyber security problem yeah well

1054
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:34,319
it's the same reason you still had

1055
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,180
police the same reason there's a war

1056
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,579
going on in Ukraine right now people do

1057
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:42,300
stupid unexpected mean things like you

1058
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,420
know there's there's always bad apples

1059
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:49,380
in every bushel you know it's just the

1060
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,599
way life Works in society if we ever fix

1061
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,520
that problem sure then it'll be fixed

1062
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,619
until then we all have job security

1063
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:58,819

1064
00:43:58,819 --> 00:44:02,220
I mean it's just crazy stuff going on in

1065
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,598
the world and in cyber security

1066
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,240
I'm curious who else has a crazy

1067
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,220
security story that's the craziest thing

1068

you've ever seen yeah
