00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,320
awesome

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,799
for my day-to-day job i do penetration

27
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,799
testing with a firm called trusted sec

28
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,640
uh that was a recent change but i really

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,880
like the cut the company the culture and

30
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,560
kind of focus on

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,159
internal

32
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,640
internal penetration tests external

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,719
wireless assessments web applications

34
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,000
kind of anything they throw at me but

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,320
that's the world i live in more of the

36
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,399
trajectory domains

37
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,760
also help co-sponsor a madsec meetup and

38
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,920
before i move on we are hosting one

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,920
tonight at the rock bottom brewery not

40
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,440
to pull you away from the con but if

41
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,879
you're interested in a drink and some

42
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,560
dinner hit rock bottom there's going to

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,239
be a milsek 920sec and madsec all kinds

44
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,280
of

45
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,400
conglomerate thing that's going to

46
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,920
happen pretty much right after this talk

47
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,800
into the evening hours whenever

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,640
and then lastly i'm an avid ghostbusters

49
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,879
fan and you know kind of growing up in

50
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,360
the mid 80s ghostbusters was my thing

51
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,080
star wars happened before my time i grew

52
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,239
up with the original movie and then also

53
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,879
the real ghostbusters cartoon had a

54
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,000
kenner

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,239
toy proton pack when i was a kid so

56
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,720
ghostbusters was my what's right up my

57
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,680
alley

58
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,599
fast forward 37 years later here now um

59
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,040
the ghostbusters afterlife film got

60
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,680
released now who here's seen after life

61
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,959
anybody

62
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,080
that's all

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,640
this whole nobody's seen afterlife okay

64
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,040
well your homework tonight or soon is

65
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,200
the go see ghostbusters afterlife

66
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
anyway for christmas this past year my

67
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,440
in-laws presented me with an awesome

68
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,000
gift it was a replica proton pack as you

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,040
see here

70
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,680
not quite as you see here but um

71
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,440
that was the gift and i was thrilled i

72
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,680
mean ghostbusters was my thing again and

73
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,760
with the movie coming out my nostalgia

74
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,480
was hitting a fever pitch

75
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,319
that said you know we have our christmas

76
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,640
dinner we um

77
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,959
we finish things up and i i take my kids

78
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,959
i'm like hey guys let's go downstairs so

79
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,640
we leave the lights off we go down into

80
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,760
the basement

81
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,200
and i'm like all right we're gonna test

82
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,799
this pack out we're gonna go bust some

83
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,959
ghosts and you know we kind of use our

84
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,480
imagination to blast some spooks

85
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,879
inspectors and whatnot and uh yeah fast

86
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,319
forward like you know five minutes if

87
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,360
they lasted even that long my kid my son

88
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,200
passes the backpack back to me and

89
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,519
underwhelmingly asks he's like dad

90
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,519
does this thing actually do anything

91
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,640
and

92
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,239
being kind of like the infosec hacker

93
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,000
mindset i had i'm like well no not

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,239
really but we certainly can make it do

95
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,200
something and that's kind of what

96
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,640
presented this talk

97
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,360
so

98
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
introducing the newest incarnation of

99
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,200
wi-fi testing technology the pump time

100
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,560
pack so what is it really it's a replica

101
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
contact that's outfitted with a bunch of

102
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,520
wireless attack arsenals and why did i

103
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,759
do this well a code that didn't have a

104
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,759
whole lot going on winter months not a

105
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,600
whole lot going on in that time frame

106
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,680
and also i had a bin full of electronic

107
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,160
devices things like arduinos raspberry

108
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,199
pi's

109
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,199
things that were just laying around also

110
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,440
like i had a 200 piece

111
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,759
arduino circuit kit you know with servos

112
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,199
and leds and

113
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,040
resistors that i always wanted to do

114
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,800
something with never really had the time

115
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,360
to do so also i walk around at hacker

116
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
conferences whether it's this one or a

117
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,720
black hat definitely i see these

118
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,560
hardware hacking villages i've always

119
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,080
been intrigued by them i'm like well you

120
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,360
know okay they're making their hat light

121
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,280
up say some cool text

122
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,720
and i was like well this would be a

123
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,160
great way for me to do something similar

124
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,440
to that

125
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
also wireless attack arsenal that was

126
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,080
collecting dust i haven't been on site

127
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,479
nearly two three years i want to say and

128
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,440
i was kind of losing my edge or my

129
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
my edge with the the wireless side much

130
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,800
all these tool sets that i wasn't really

131
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,720
using at the time like well let's start

132
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,080
integrating some of this into the proton

133
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,440
pack

134
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
and lastly this talk is kind of to

135
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
inspire some newcomers whether you

136
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,039
you're new to infosec whether you did a

137
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,199
hardware hacking i was i learned a

138
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,320
little bit so i thought this would be a

139
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,400
great way to kind of showcase that and

140
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,440
uh

141
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,600
be like a conversation piece so at

142
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,960
conferences you wear this thing around

143
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,720
it's bound to ask you know get some

144
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,520
attention and ask some questions

145
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,440
so what are the features of this pack

146
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,000
well it does have a uh the ability to

147
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,280
derogate access points so that's going

148
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,199
to do to it based on the beacon

149
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,120
impersonation attack so

150
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,320
as your device is connected to your

151
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,600
preferred network in the past and your

152
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,960
preferred network list it's going to

153
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,720
listen for those beacons

154
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,479
that your your phones and your laptops

155
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,639
are always weakening out and this pack

156
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,560
will on the fly spin up those networks

157
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,000
and say hey you're looking for free

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,319
coffee wi-fi i'm free coffee wi-fi

159
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,160
you're looking for in-play gogo i'm

160
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,680
going to play gogo so it's using the

161
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,919
wi-fi pineapple technology to

162
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,240
handle those attacks also the evil twin

163
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,720
wpa enterprise attacks so if you've got

164
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,360
a network that employs an organization

165
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,759
like radius authentication you can clone

166
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,600
that network you can

167
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,199
get clients to associate to you and

168
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,199
potentially grab credentials and or

169
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,960
handshakes

170
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,639
it does spectrum analysis this is kind

171
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,639
of cool a cool thing on the pack so it

172
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,960
supports both the 2.4 and 5 gigahertz

173
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,800
spectrum and actually we'll go over it a

174
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,919
little bit more in depth but on the

175
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,360
neutron line there's a microcontroller

176
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,440
that has an oled display that will

177
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,039
actually read out

178
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,120
different channels the strengths the

179
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
activity the targets the clients all

180
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
within that little display so as you're

181
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,560
going there you can you can kind of get

182
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,000
a real readout and really feel like

183
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,039
you're doing something with it when

184
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,800
you're holding the lawn

185
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,479
it does wpa attacks so it's going to

186
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,080
look for your partial and full handshake

187
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,400
so there's e-pull packets if clients are

188
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,000
out associating networks it's going to

189
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,680
find those handshakes capture them you

190
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,160
can take them offline for key recovery

191
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,479
and also the pmk-id attacks so that's

192
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,680
going to be if your network is

193
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
clientless you can attack the access

194
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,160
point and if you find these pmk-id

195
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,599
association frames you can take those

196
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,120
and potentially crack them offline based

197
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,479
on a weak algorithm that's often

198
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,400
employed with those

199
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,000
and then lastly the authentication

200
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,840
attacks again through the wand and also

201
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,199
through a few of these other antennas at

202
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,960
the top it's constantly monitoring

203
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,720
looking for networks and you can go

204
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,800
selectively target

205
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,080
certain networks and our clients can

206
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,360
knock offline and that's kind of cool

207
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,720
with the blaster this whole concept you

208
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,400
kind of point with the directional yagi

209
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,319
antenna where you want to go you blast

210
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,680
it and knocks it offline you capture the

211
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,960
handshakes on these antennas at the top

212
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,160
so looking from the exterior so we got

213
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,599
at the top here

214
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,680
two roll base antennas that's option

215
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,360
number one and those are again for your

216
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,080
rogue aps you got a pony gotcha that i

217
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
implemented in here really that was

218
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,280
because i wanted to get familiar with

219
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,639
opponent actually

220
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,240
i know i see ryan in the crowd he's done

221
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,360
a lot of work with that i want to kind

222
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,720
of get familiar with the project i've

223
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,639
never really touched it before

224
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,879
so it's got a built-in portage it's got

225
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,720
a 3.8 inch or a 3x8 led matrix display

226
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,400
again something i wanted to kind of get

227
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,240
familiar with never really done it so

228
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
i'm like well let's throw a led matrix

229
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,319
on there and that's again to advertise

230
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,560
information about the pack and the tones

231
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,560
now

232
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,360
there go figure when you're traveling

233
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,719
maybe you're not going to wire this but

234
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,519
that led display should be lighting up

235
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,760
um number four it's got a uh management

236
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,958
radio interface and this is to

237
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,519
administer the pac via wi-fi interface

238
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,920
via am a web interface so you can manage

239
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
the campaigns you can manage it in scope

240
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,680
networks do a bunch of stuff to kind of

241
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,720
control and how the packs operating

242
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,959
number five at the top this antenna up

243
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,720
here should be moving right now it

244
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,440
should be panning in 180 degree motion

245
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,560
and

246
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,760
that's not happening right now either i

247
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,080
apologize number six did neutron on at

248
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,680
the very end it's got a microcontroller

249
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,519
at the end we'll go cover that a little

250
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,959
bit more that's where you're attacking

251
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,120
and also the spectrum analysis and then

252
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
lastly that microcontroller routes

253
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
through a 2.4 gigahertz

254
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,360
yagi antenna again to kind of point

255
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,560
where you want to go when you want to

256
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,560
attack

257
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,279
hardware wise what's running under the

258
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,760
hood so we do have a pi 4 in here

259
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,600
the reason i went with the pi 4 like a

260
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,800
lot of people like why don't you use a

261
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,600
pi zero a you can't find a pi zero in

262
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,959
stock right now you just can't source

263
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,800
one so i have a pi 4 laying around i

264
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,720
figured let's go ahead and use it one

265
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,640
advantage of the pi 4 allowed me to use

266
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,680
external

267
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,360
wireless adapters that supported 5

268
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,279
gigahertz spectrums so a little bit more

269
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,399
power i could look up an external

270
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,080
adapter and get that point of gaucher at

271
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,560
the top reading five gigahertz so

272
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,720
it does dual band support

273
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,000
feedback being the 2.13 inch ink display

274
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,040
and again that's going to be for your

275
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,000
wpa handshakes and pmk id attacks it's

276
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
also got the mark 7 pineapple so the

277
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,959
newer pineapple that's doing all your

278
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,360
beacon and uh beacon impersonations

279
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,120
rogue attacks

280
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,120
enterprise evil twin attacks so on and

281
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,200
so forth neat thing with that uh

282
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,880
pineapple is you can it's modular in

283
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,800
design so you can do more

284
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,880
um like man in the middle once you get a

285
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,959
few clients connected you can you know

286
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,040
tcp down url snark whatever you need to

287
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,560
do

288
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,800
you control that traffic

289
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,240
i'm sorry i jump back one side here

290
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,920
at the very top of this pack too you'll

291
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,200
see the arduino up there at the very top

292
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,360
that's again controlling the led matrix

293
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
display and the

294
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
and the servo and then at the very

295
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,160
bottom here all these wires is the uh

296
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,079
the light and sound kit so there's a

297
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,000
microcontroller in here that supports

298
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
lighting sounds for movie movie accurate

299
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,959
effects

300
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,560
it's also got a soundtrack mode here so

301
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,920
you can cycle through certain you know

302
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,680
key songs to post with this franchise

303
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,479
which will go over here

304
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,560
the pornogaji again that's more of a

305
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,399
user interface than uh

306
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,760
augment or

307
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,519
artificial intelligence it's just a

308
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,120
front end for better cap is what it's

309
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,560
using under the hood does anyone use

310
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,640
better cap here in the room a few on

311
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,800
quite a few so it's a great way to kind

312
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,079
of automate some of these wireless

313
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,240
attacks it's again that's the main job

314
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,720
is to monitor for e-pull frames and pmk

315
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,000
id frames

316
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,800
um

317
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,120
and also i modified mine to a support

318
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,279
the 5-day great spectrum but also throw

319
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,880
some key ghostbuster movie quotes in

320
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,399
there so you say like don't cross the

321
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,640
streams are you the key master things i

322
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,399
kind of created this theme i really

323
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,760
wanted to update the face on the

324
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,760
ponegatchee there's a little outside of

325
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,320
my web ui know-how but maybe they'll be

326
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,839
coming for a future presentation

327
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,240
microcontrollers it's got a few of them

328
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,360
in here and again that was kind of the

329
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,519
main concept of doing this whole talk is

330
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,880
figuring out how these microcontrollers

331
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,120
work hey look there's the led matrix

332
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,480
doing its thing when it's supposed to be

333
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,839
doing this thing

334
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,440
um so i have three of them i have an

335
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,600
arduino nano that's using the matrix

336
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,279
display and also controlling the servo

337
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,360
motor at the top to make that antenna

338
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,560
back and forth

339
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,560
it's got a proprietary light and sound

340
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,440
kit

341
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,680
again that's for the freaking geek movie

342
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,200
accurate effects so

343
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,519
this led and the cyclotron that goes

344
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,040
around goes in a certain order and a lot

345
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,959
of ghostbusters are very specific to how

346
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,480
that should look that's what that

347
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,079
microcontrollers are

348
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,360
doing

349
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,760
then also got in the neutron launch that

350
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,200
you pull up uh proprietary esp-07

351
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,480
microcontroller

352
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
and the neat thing about that controller

353
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,000
is it's got an external wi-fi interface

354
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,920
and that's how i link into the um the

355
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,399
2.4 gigahertz yeah the antenna there

356
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,000
one neat call out here that i really

357
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,160
want to hammer home is um the bottom

358
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,240
left image is from a website called wkwi

359
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
and it's a virtual environment that

360
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,760
allows you to piece together these

361
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,839
components so before i even picked up my

362
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,680
soldering iron or any electronic

363
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,079
components i could say i have an arduino

364
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,959
i have a matrix display i have a servo i

365
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,040
can wire it virtually i get real-time

366
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,800
feedback push code to it troubleshoot it

367
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,160
figure out how it's all working so this

368
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,000
is really kind of a sticking point to

369
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,320
help me get past like all right see this

370
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,480
project from the concept to actually

371
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
have it do something so i would really

372
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,120
highly recommend the tiny tinyurl.com

373
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,959
black ponytail pack that'll take you to

374
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,839
the wokwey site and uh you can actually

375
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,079
see the same code that i used to push it

376
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,519
it's a neat site definitely check it out

377
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,200
it's kind of like legos for adults

378
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,760
really

379
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,279
do neutron so here you see the

380
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,000
microcontroller in action so again the

381
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
the wand actually has three circuits on

382
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,440
it the three circuits are going to power

383
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,959
on the lawn you get kind of light and

384
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,399
sound sequence from the movie accurate

385
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,600
effects

386
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,839
the top toggle here will actually power

387
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,560
down into our soundtrack mode and with

388
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,680
the soundtrack mode that's going to

389
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,040
cycle through like the ghostbusters

390
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,599
theme song

391
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,079
bobby browns tune all the ones that are

392
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,279
very unique to the ghostbusters

393
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,480
franchise

394
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,079
and then the third toggle switch will

395
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,440
activate the attack mode which should

396
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,279
turn again turn on the

397
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,000
oh you know what

398
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,360
i just wasn't thinking

399
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,639
there it is i have the wrong switch so

400
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,040
the third toggle will power on the um

401
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,199
led matrix display that in the same

402
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,360
camera yeah

403
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,800
all right

404
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,959
need to say the uh the microcontroller

405
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,000
has the

406
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
oled display and as you can see on the

407
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,199
video that allows you to cycle through

408
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,240
you can actually get a real-time

409
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,639
spectrum reading of you know what final

410
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,959
channel is it only a few packets or is

411
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,480
it loaded hundreds of packages you know

412
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,680
that channel is the one you want to go

413
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,519
after it's really neat to have that

414
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,959
blonde but actually be able to toggle

415
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,800
through what you're looking at from then

416
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,480
you there you can select certain target

417
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
networks you want to go after clients

418
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,399
that are connected to that target you

419
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,800
can then point it out shoot it and send

420
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,639
the authentication frames to knock them

421
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,880
offline hoping to get instant responses

422
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,519
on your your receiving antennas

423
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,920
oh wait i'll step back on this here

424
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
um the references down below are the

425
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
software that microcontroller is using i

426
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,360
didn't write that that was written by

427
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,519
space hunting tech and it's um

428
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,920
esp8266 the author project again i

429
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,360
hardly even flash these things in the

430
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,399
past so just learning how to

431
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,160
interoperate with these micro micro

432
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
controllers and wire them up was a

433
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,000
learning curve for me but i took a lot

434
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,040
out of it

435
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,440
lastly the dsi hardware he did this

436
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,560
proprietary

437
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,399
microcontroller there's a lot of these

438
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,560
controllers out there i found using his

439
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,360
this like 14 shift from china to get to

440
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,519
my doorstep was a lot easier than trying

441
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,920
to kind of like create my own and

442
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,760
and do what i needed to do so definitely

443
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,279
check out his project it was really cool

444
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,279
because again this microcontroller

445
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,519
allowed me to link up an external yaging

446
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,360
antenna which i think was pretty neat

447
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,279
power management so this was one of the

448
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,120
struggles i ran into with this pack is

449
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,720
there's a lot going on we have arduino

450
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,360
support i found that this light and

451
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,440
sound kit has a speaker that requires a

452
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,399
12 volt source so i had a 12 volt 5 volt

453
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,079
i was kind of splicing wires here and

454
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,240
there and everywhere and really landed

455
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,680
on two separate batteries so i got a

456
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,600
lipo that has a 12 volt and 5 volt

457
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,839
output that powers a sound board lights

458
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,120
an arduino device and then a separate uh

459
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,279
38 000 lamp battery that powers the

460
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,160
pineapple in the pi

461
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,120
and at the bottom here you'll actually

462
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,880
see two switches here those are gonna

463
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,480
independently control each of the

464
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
pineapples in the pie so again

465
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,759
when you turn on the pack it doesn't

466
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,759
just draw the battery because those two

467
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,600
devices will drop them down so you can

468
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,199
toggle them on as you need to and i

469
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,480
thought that's kind of a neat little ad

470
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,079
to say okay i want the pineapple i want

471
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,320
the pie now i can taco doesn't control

472
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,560
this

473
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,399
let's see this is all managed again by

474
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,680
connecting to the

475
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,279
management web interface of the

476
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,000
pineapple and then really all i'm using

477
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,360
is the

478
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,120
the pony keys are the piney piece

479
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,959
software that's provided by the wi-fi

480
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,120
pineapple i just skated to throw some

481
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,720
ghostbuster stuff on there i thought it

482
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,240
looked kind of cool but i

483
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,000
haven't really done a whole lot to the

484
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,519
software because everything they do

485
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,120
works really well i'm really happy with

486
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,800
it but yeah just threw some ghostbuster

487
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,000
stuff on there i thought it looked kind

488
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,240
of neat

489
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,959
here's a demo of the pack in action

490
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,920
so you powered it on

491
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,839
that initiates the power on sequence the

492
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,839
cycle trying to start going the lights

493
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,480
start going

494
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,520
the blaster effect

495
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,559
next is the soundtrack sequence

496
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,799
so some ghostbusters specific songs and

497
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,050
beans

498
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,439
[Music]

499
