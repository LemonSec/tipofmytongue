4
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,839

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,320
good morning everyone appreciate y'all

6
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,559
being here at 10 a.m it's uh it's early

7
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,360
after last night but uh i'm

8
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,600
happy we didn't lose the entire room i'm

9
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,119
really excited to be here thank you for

10
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,000
coming here i'm hopefully going to

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,520
inform you a little bit entertain you a

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,479
little bit

13
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,119
about kind of my my niche in the kind of

14
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,439
blockchain crypto area so

15
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,320
uh what i really focus on are real world

16
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,560
service

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,040
service projects that have a watching or

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,360
crypto component to them so mostly

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,119
because i you know a little bit of old

20
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,560
school i remember when you know mining

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,799
bitcoin we kind of did it for fun with

22
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,200
uh with extra cpu cycles

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,880
rather than purely for like d5 profit so

24
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,159
this talk is really what i've been

25
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,640
working on for the past two years um

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,200
specifically the main project that i'm

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,720
going to talk about today has just

28
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,520
exploded it went from absolutely

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,600
you know nothing out there to

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,040
now this morning i saw they're almost at

31
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,399
800 000

32
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,640
um hot spots providing wireless coverage

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,920
all over the world

34
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,159
mostly in the united states

35
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,000
and also some clonesley's projects

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,040
coming up

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,520
so i did put on here part one because in

38
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,038
my opinion there's just not enough time

39
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,800
to really go into what i believe are the

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,319
long-term ramifications of this new

41
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,560
kind of take on

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,560
kind of these i don't really like the

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,160
word decentralizing i like the word

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,239
distributed a lot better of distributed

45
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,319
telecom where it rewards all the

46
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,640
stakeholders that are out there

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,160
so

48
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,560
you know who am i what do i know why am

49
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,599
i interested in this type of tech

50
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,040
you know i'm not going to say here i

51
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,239
know everything about a project out

52
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,720
there i would not be surprised at all if

53
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,480
somebody came up here or even during the

54
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,920
talk said oh have you heard of this

55
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,040
project

56
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
it's pretty much weekly or daily i hear

57
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,879
about another project out there that

58
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,040
provides some type of real service i'm

59
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,720
going to talk here about the ones that i

60
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,319
believe are more

61
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,400
more popular more well known in kind of

62
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,280
this niche area of real world services

63
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,360
but there are many more

64
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,680
that provide a variety of

65
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,159
basically tokens for weather data

66
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,920
for door traffic data

67
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,319
for temperature data for

68
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,159
air quality data there's a whole bunch

69
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,680
of these projects out there but for this

70
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
talk here i'm really going to focus on

71
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,280
the telecommunications projects because

72
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,239
i believe that those are going to have

73
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,080
the biggest impact over the next five to

74
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,000
ten years

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,480
so uh why am i into this kind of niche

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,920
of crypto why do i think it's

77
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,440
interesting uh why do i think it's

78
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,360
actually going somewhere

79
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,680
so mainly because i i spent quite a few

80
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,000
years working at verizon wireless

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,760
actually here in milwaukee and while i

82
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,879
was there

83
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,959
i built tools and deployed just cell

84
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,400
sites all over the state all over the

85
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,480
midwest got to travel all over the world

86
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,080
basically bringing up telecommunications

87
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,200
services

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,879
spent a lot of time working on routers

89
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,360
and switches working in data centers

90
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,879
flying overseas setting up cloud

91
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,440
services i set up verizon's first cloud

92
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,400
platform so i did a lot of work while i

93
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,159
was at verizon

94
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,680
however

95
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,200
i'm sure everyone's aware the

96
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,799
telecommunication industry isn't exactly

97
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,400
known to be you know innovative you

98
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,480
usually treat it as a local kind of

99
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,879
oligopoly or local monopoly for the most

100
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,879
part um you've got kind of your bigger

101
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,000
players and you're smaller players that

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,760
are out there most of the big players

103
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,760
especially wireless telecon we're going

104
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,880
to be verizon 18 t-mobile

105
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,320
and then you've got your smaller players

106
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,000
such as u.s sailor which we have here

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,720
locally as well

108
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
so i'm active

109
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,320
extremely active in these projects not

110
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,160
only just as an enthusiast but also as

111
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,199
an investor a mentor advisor

112
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,160
so i am a volunteer with the dui license

113
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,240
dui alliance which is

114
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,880
a non-profit group that is set up to

115
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,040
basically provide expertise from people

116
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
who have a background in telecom for

117
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,400
these new projects and pitches that are

118
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,960
coming up so actually this is open on

119
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
github anyone can request one of these

120
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,199
projects if you have an idea

121
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,800
especially there's a shortage in all

122
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,919
these projects of having enough

123
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,680
programmers

124
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,120
but if you have an idea like why doesn't

125
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,560
your project do this or i want to create

126
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,919
this new sensor

127
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,919
or i want to use this wireless network

128
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,240
in kind of a new novel way

129
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,840
they'll actually give you a bunch of

130
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,759
tokens and it's not it's not a small

131
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,000
amount they'll give you 40 50

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,120
in some cases you know over 200 grand

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,000
of course it's going to be in their

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,880
token uh to go and pursue these projects

135
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,479
and the dui why it's kind of a

136
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,360
non-profit board that goes through those

137
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,600
ideas and say which ones we should

138
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,120
go ahead and find which ones need more

139
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,440
work or shouldn't be hungry

140
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,880
been volunteering with forum here in

141
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,800
milwaukee for many years

142
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,880
i frequently speak at college campuses

143
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,400
such as libya whitewater uw oshkosh uw

144
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,440
madison

145
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,800
we're lucky here to have quite a few

146
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,240
students from those schools here

147
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,919
actually volunteering over at blockchain

148
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,960
village yesterday and today

149
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,160
i also work with

150
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,840
startups i really focus on local

151
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,680
startups here in the uh here in

152
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,240
wisconsin

153
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,680
with that

154
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,800
there aren't

155
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,400
there aren't a lot of people

156
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,080
who worked in telecom and kind of got

157
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,880
out

158
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,440
i appear to be one of the few

159
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,960
so i've been trying to share knowledge

160
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,880
with the community

161
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,560
as much as i could

162
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,400
so i've been on multiple podcasts i've

163
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,240
done multiple interviews trying to

164
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,800
explain to you know quote normies how

165
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,880
does telecommunications work

166
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,720
what is realistic what should we be

167
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
focusing on in order to kind of grow

168
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,919
these projects and actually turn them

169
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,319
into something that's real not just

170
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,600
a bunch of people

171
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,960
buying these

172
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,840
uh wireless telecommunication uh quote

173
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,280
minors

174
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,880
and jumping in to make a quick buck how

175
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,840
are we going to make this survive for

176
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,240
the next five 10 15 20 years and

177
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,960
actually hit our profits goals um and

178
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,479
turn this out of just you know yet

179
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,000
another crypto project everyone's just

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,759
in for the money

181
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,120
uh so

182
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,880
um the reason why i've been really

183
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,199
excited about this type of technology is

184
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,199
really in my opinion

185
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,440
wireless communication

186
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,479
still today is is somewhat poor meaning

187
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,800
that it's extremely expensive

188
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,639
in my opinion

189
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,080
we should be able to bring the cost down

190
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,880
wireless communication um in addition um

191
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,440
even today um people have coverage

192
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,520
problems um how can we still have

193
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
coverage problems we're now on the fifth

194
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
generation that's wireless technology we

195
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,120
still haven't figured out how to get

196
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,919
coverage everywhere um everywhere not

197
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,520
only the country but in the world and to

198
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,599
me that that you know

199
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,440
this shouldn't be this hard after since

200
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,479
we've been doing this since the 80s

201
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,240
so the i'll talk a little bit more about

202
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,560
this but the real goal of these projects

203
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,319
are to bring down so that you can get

204
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,759
wireless service for a variety of

205
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,479
providers at very low cost that you pick

206
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,319
you may even have multiple providers

207
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,560
at extremely low cost by extremely low i

208
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,840
mean maybe 20 25 bucks a month

209
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,919
maybe less which is considerably lower

210
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,080
than more costs today

211
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,880
so

212
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,440
i grabbed some stats here from accenture

213
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,879
they kind of swagged that and were the

214
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,240
numbers so

215
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,160
the worst telecommunication industry is

216
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
a humongous industry we've got millions

217
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,800
of people working in the industry

218
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,960
there's you know tremendous impact on

219
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,720
the economy

220
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,000
and as well as the revenue that they

221
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,039
bring in so it's an extremely

222
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,879
extremely old industry

223
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,720
that i i think just doesn't isn't

224
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,080
innovating fast enough to keep up

225
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,440
so as i mentioned earlier the cost here

226
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,080
in my opinion could be a lot lower

227
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,240
the average cost here you know i i

228
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,639
pulled up one study here is about 113.

229
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,000
uh but it's very common for people to

230
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,320
play pay in my opinion around 100 a

231
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,640
month for an average unlimited plan with

232
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,360
the

233
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,839
major carriers verizon or 18t uh

234
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,279
t-mobile which will keep somewhat more

235
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,120
affordable

236
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,719
and we've seen actually you know some

237
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,320
other projects try to take this on so

238
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,399
famously we saw google with the loon

239
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,839
project say we're going to put up hot

240
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,760
air balloons and those air balloons are

241
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,440
going to provide wireless service and

242
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,880
kind of beam that around and that

243
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,000
project ended up not going anywhere

244
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,920
and being discontinued

245
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,360
the latest one that's gotten a lot of

246
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,600
attention of course is starlink

247
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,800
so outside of having some latency issues

248
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,200
it's ubiquitous it does provide a lot of

249
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,440
i think more competition to kind of

250
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,680
bring down some of these prices and get

251
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,959
more available in major talents and

252
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,640
cities to where you've got a bigger

253
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,560
spectrum or a t

254
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,920
or another incoming provider and that's

255
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,720
it

256
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,480
you've got more choice out there creates

257
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,560
more competition brings the price down

258
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,600
so

259
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,040
we've been very very lucky here in the

260
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,560
united states mostly because of the fcc

261
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,200
i still today don't quite understand how

262
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,160
we got so lucky we have one of the you

263
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,080
know really the best

264
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,920
uh wireless spectrum rules in the entire

265
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,680
world and i don't know quite how it

266
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,160
happened it's still amazing to me the

267
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,080
really two key innovations that happened

268
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,200
with the fcc is they deregulated a lot

269
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,399
of

270
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,399
formally used formerly military spectrum

271
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,000
so cbrs

272
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
so it stands for citizens banned radio

273
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,880
service

274
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,959
so basically what they've done similar

275
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,959
to what you use with wi-fi and 2.4

276
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,800
gigahertz and five gigahertz they said

277
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,399
we're going to create a

278
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,480
spectrum that you can use

279
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,640
for broadband communications and anyone

280
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,920
can use it you don't have to buy it you

281
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,519
don't have to pay like a you know

282
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,640
typically the carriers are paying

283
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,880
billions for these for the spectrum for

284
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,120
the entire country anyone can use it

285
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,880
there is a

286
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,720
licensing process for people who certify

287
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,920
these installs

288
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,800
when you get into cellular

289
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
communications there are some barriers

290
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,760
up there

291
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,880
however

292
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,560
many of the projects have put together

293
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,200
kind of remote services to make it so

294
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,640
easy for anyone who doesn't really

295
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,000
understand all this to still have this

296
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,160
done in their home or business

297
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,480
um the second part of it is um what they

298
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,240
call old tart rules

299
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,560
and it's not a bad thing

300
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,240
basically those rules

301
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,800
override um

302
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,680
your local hoa even your state law to

303
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,160
allow you to put up uh broadband

304
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,000
communication networks so you can

305
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,839
override it and this has been referring

306
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,800
to court multiple times um saying that

307
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,000
you know if you want to put a giant

308
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,839
intent on your roof now there are of

309
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,760
course fcc regulations for safety and

310
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,839
height limitations but as long as you

311
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,480
follow the rules

312
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,600
you can

313
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,240
keep it up and the hoa can't complain

314
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,760
it's ugly and have forced you to take it

315
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,720
down

316
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,880
and those are very very strong

317
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,200
rules there so

318
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,320
really that those are the two key

319
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,079
innovations that even makes possible if

320
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,920
we didn't have cbrs spectrum these

321
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,200
projects would have been dead they'd

322
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,640
never gotten off the ground three years

323
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,519
ago

324
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,800
and really started to take off two years

325
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,680
ago

326
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,399
and the ability to actually have federal

327
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,640
law from the fcc that's actually strong

328
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,079
has some teeth to it to allow people to

329
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,640
do this is just incredible so those are

330
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,720
really the incentives that came up and

331
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,240
made this possible on a theoretical

332
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,519
level

333
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,120
from this um the the largest network

334
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,279
that i'm going to talk about is helium

335
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,880
what they did is they they saw these

336
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,399
rule changes and said you know we should

337
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,480
take advantage of this why don't we

338
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,519
start building a communications network

339
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,680
that's built on a blockchain

340
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,000
to where anyone can put up broadband

341
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,959
service

342
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,800
um in the world although it's more

343
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,200
popular in my opinion the united states

344
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,320
mostly because we have friendlier

345
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,200
spectrum rules and we actually share

346
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,639
what you make

347
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,200
with whoever sets it up so when you put

348
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,560
up one of these

349
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,040
hot spots sell sites micro sales you

350
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,160
call them different things but they all

351
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,680
provide wireless service

352
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,720
you actually get paid in real time when

353
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,600
uh when those are operating service

354
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,279
now even when you do that no one's going

355
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,519
to do it you know off the bat because

356
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,920
great i bought this usually expensive

357
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,959
miner

358
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,200
and it's not going to pay very much

359
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,000
if no one uses it so

360
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,079
they've really innovated with

361
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,079
in that space to influence people to do

362
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,200
it by creating a new

363
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
a new approach that called proof of

364
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,600
coverage so these miners when they go up

365
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,519
and start producing wireless service

366
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,600
they actually talk to each other

367
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,399
one

368
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,079
sends out basically kind of a hello

369
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,440
packet everybody there you're like can

370
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,839
you hear me this is my unique global id

371
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,079
and then the ones around it listen they

372
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,399
hear it and then they say yes i hear you

373
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,760
and then the network protocol says great

374
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,120
um you're actually there you're not

375
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,279
lying by your location within

376
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,839
you know maybe 100 meters and

377
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,680
we're going to reward you for that so

378
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,800
you can get paid even if you're not

379
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,320
actually taking on any traffic now

380
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,200
that's

381
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,800
uh very exciting and makes it easier to

382
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,959
deploy and pay people early on the flip

383
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,200
side it somewhat defeats the purpose of

384
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,720
it which was to actually get traffic on

385
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,399
it but no one's going to jump on one of

386
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,320
these networks if they don't exist so

387
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,399
that's how they fix the problem of

388
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,800
actually getting people to say okay the

389
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,680
roi on this is this if i do this install

390
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,360
this location

391
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,440
this makes monetary sense there's other

392
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,639
there's plenty of people who do it don't

393
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,480
care about the money as well

394
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,399
but the very large

395
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,920
um what i would call multi-service

396
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,320
operators um and i'm i'm one of them as

397
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,800
well um you know go in there and say i

398
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,560
want to grow the network as well but

399
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,839
most people don't understand this

400
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,000
technology um maybe as soon as you

401
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,920
mention it's blockchain or crypto have

402
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,639
no

403
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,000
interest in it

404
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,199
at all due to its bad reputation so

405
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,959
we make it simple

406
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,199
we'll basically manage it for people

407
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,959
and then just pay them every month and

408
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,040
help them have a good install that we

409
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,800
have some confidence will make a certain

410
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,600
amount

411
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,440
now i mentioned other projects here as

412
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,079
well because this first

413
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,760
network the helium network has been so

414
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,639
popular it spawned many copycats out

415
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,440
there

416
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,720
and i mean that in a good way they've

417
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,160
taken it and changed some things about

418
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,760
the protocol

419
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,279
and said we're going to do that as well

420
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,800
but we're going to tweak it a little bit

421
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,000
so

422
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,839
that's kind of the exciting part

423
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,920
pollen is one

424
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,680
project that's taken that on and what

425
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,920
they've done is they said well helium

426
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,040
says we want to do all wireless

427
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,120
communication which by all it really

428
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,440
comes down to lorawan based

429
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,639
communication

430
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,160
cellular communication and wi-fi

431
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,680
communication

432
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
so their long-term plan is to say

433
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,199
you can have one of these you know what

434
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,880
they call miner that provides all three

435
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
of those viral services from your house

436
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,800
or from your business uh from your

437
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,920
rental uh rental unit and people can use

438
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,360
all three and you will get rewarded for

439
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,639
them

440
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,880
pollen has said that's too complicated

441
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,160
we don't believe in wi-fi i don't

442
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,519
believe in lorawan we're just going to

443
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,480
do cellular so they're only deploying a

444
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,240
4g cellular network

445
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,079
now there are many more other projects

446
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,680
out there i mentioned level 5 which

447
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,880
slows it quickly

448
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,000
off the ground

449
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,360
and there's you know half a dozen more

450
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,000
right behind him

451
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,800
so

452
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
uh go into more detail here this is

453
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,600
probably the first time you've ever

454
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,320
heard of the cbr spectrum um

455
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,240
and it's it's fairly recent it wasn't

456
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,680
didn't really come

457
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,279
really into

458
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,760
effect until beginning of 2020

459
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,199
which is you know around when the

460
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,040
pandemic started

461
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,279
so that we've got 150 megahertz which is

462
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,120
not very much in the cellular world

463
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,440
typically you're going to want 200 300

464
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,759
400 500 as much as you can get

465
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,639
and it's in the 3.5 gigahertz band um

466
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,959
that's not a great band for long-range

467
00:15:58,959 --> 00:15:59,839
communications you usually want

468
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,600
something closer to 600 megahertz the

469
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,279
higher you go you get higher bandwidth

470
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,360
but you typically have less ability to

471
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,959
penetrate

472
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,560
buildings trees et cetera

473
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,040
but they they open that up

474
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,600
and now anyone can use it so it's like

475
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,199
being able to just like

476
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,120
it creates the ability so that anyone

477
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,720
can set up cellular surface kind of like

478
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,560
buying a wi-fi router

479
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,360
which is really uh in my opinion really

480
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,800
innovative

481
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,040
um so otard stands for over-the-air

482
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,079
reception devices and what it does

483
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,759
is really protects

484
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,240
anyone who wants to expand broadband

485
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,279
network

486
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,440
this somewhat came in from some feedback

487
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,199
that

488
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,040
a lot of operators were kind of sick of

489
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,880
getting pushbacks from

490
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,120
the city county state

491
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,600
hoas saying oh you know you can't

492
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,800
install this you can't put this up

493
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
because it's ugly and they said well in

494
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,320
order for the united states to be

495
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,720
competitive we need as much there we

496
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,480
need infinite broadband

497
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,560
and we need to promote

498
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,480
the rights of people who want to expand

499
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,959
broadband networks

500
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,880
so i think we got really lucky i don't

501
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,039
think we get one thing we got too

502
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,799
in other countries it's not like this at

503
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,640
all there is no

504
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,280
there is no kind of concept of cellular

505
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,599
unlicensed communication

506
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,160
there is no concept of the right to

507
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,799
expand uh cellular networks you have to

508
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,400
buy it you have to work with existing

509
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,319
telecom providers it's a very slow

510
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,120
cumbersome expensive process

511
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,400
so

512
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,919
in my opinion you know these are all

513
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,919
taking different approaches um i do like

514
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,360
helium that's going after everything

515
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,720
that's out there so they're they're

516
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,400
saying we're gonna try everything we're

517
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,080
gonna see what works and give people a

518
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,160
choice so you can um you can use what's

519
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
called utility tokens from all this so

520
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,840
when you actually this is their version

521
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
of proof of work it's really proof of

522
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,160
wireless service um and actual data

523
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,080
communications and these are all public

524
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
uh over in the blockchain village i've

525
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
got live screens up you can see where

526
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,120
they all are you can also see what

527
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,240
everybody makes

528
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,480
you can see who uh whose wallet owns

529
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,760
them you don't know who it is we can see

530
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,600
a lot that they have

531
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,320
so it's radically more transparent than

532
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,760
anything i've ever seen in the telecom

533
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
industry much more affordable and that's

534
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,280
what's allowed it to grow so quickly

535
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,840
so how does this kind of work if you

536
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,600
want to do it and join one of these

537
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,200
networks so

538
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,520
you have to buy the equipment uh it can

539
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,440
range from a small device

540
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,960
to a very large one like what's pictured

541
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,400
there offering a 4g lte service

542
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,919
powered by a solar panel and a battery

543
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,640
on the top of a mountain or an attic top

544
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,840
of a roof

545
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,240
they're all over the place

546
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
and those are the equipment that you

547
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
need in order to provide that coverage

548
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,960
um next you got to pick you know you got

549
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,080
to see what projects are out there

550
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,679
that's compatible with that equipment a

551
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,919
lot of them either create the build the

552
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,039
equipment or certified equipment

553
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,120
themselves you have to go through them

554
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,400
otherwise they have a list of approved

555
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,480
manufacturers to where you can just buy

556
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,559
it on board which is really attaching it

557
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,240
to your wallet and then once it's open

558
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,280
in service

559
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,200
you start earning from it

560
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
a lot of manufacturers have jumped onto

561
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,960
this and this includes

562
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
companies here in wisconsin as well so

563
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,400
so base sales

564
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,600
their north american headquarters is

565
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,919
actually madison and they provide a lot

566
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:14,960
of the

567
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,760
um 4g lte equipment actually for almost

568
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,000
all these projects so wisconsin is a

569
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,440
part of this innovation as well and it's

570
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,960
actually helping the local economy in

571
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,640
this tremendous demand for this

572
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,039
equipment

573
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,840
so i mentioned proof of coverage and

574
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,280
i want to explain a little bit what does

575
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,520
that mean that's a very new kind of

576
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
concept and it's really one out there

577
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,919
saying can you hear me and then at least

578
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,720
one says i hear you that validates you

579
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,679
are

580
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:42,799
physically

581
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,960
nearing me um you're gonna get a reward

582
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,160
for them

583
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,559
now they they've had a lot of issues

584
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,720
with people trying to gain this so just

585
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,559
because no one hears you you know what

586
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,240
that other one is also next to you or

587
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,919
what if somebody buys 50 of them puts

588
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,080
them on their basement uh yes that's

589
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,039
happening and they're working on

590
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,280
different measures to kind of

591
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,200
through data analysis determine if it

592
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,960
appears to be real appears to be fake

593
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,039
this is an ongoing issue

594
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,320
especially with

595
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,480
uh with a lot of chinese installations

596
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,320
russian installations to where they have

597
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,080
no interest in providing any real

598
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,679
service they just they just want to get

599
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,640
the tokens and be paid

600
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
so where are we at right now so

601
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,440
um you know i put a screenshot in here

602
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,799
um of helium uh it's

603
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,000
it's only from a month ago but it's

604
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,600
already quite a bit bigger if you go

605
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,120
back two years it was there was nothing

606
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,240
in wisconsin

607
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,760
and now here we've got thousands of

608
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,480
these um especially in dense metro areas

609
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,320
but they're at appleton they're in green

610
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,960
bay they're in menomonie you know up by

611
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
the finger like you know where we touch

612
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,679
the michigan wisconsin border

613
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,679
they're all over the place and there's

614
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,120
actually facebook groups there's one

615
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,640
here in milwaukee it talks about people

616
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,840
doing installations and sharing

617
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,520
equipment giving advice

618
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,440
and what is a good installation you say

619
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,880
we want to buy one

620
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,320
that kind of stuff

621
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,960
so it's really blown up it's also was

622
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,039
featured in a february article in the

623
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,039
new york times about how

624
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,480
maybe we're

625
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,440
actually finding real world services and

626
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,000
a real benefit to crypto besides just um

627
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,679
you know a lot of

628
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,600
dgen projects or decentralized finance

629
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,799
projects

630
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,158
out there that are purely for the money

631
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,880
so i mentioned a new project that just

632
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,840
this just went public

633
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,200
allowing anyone to participate about

634
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,799
three weeks ago

635
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,159
and this is the pollen network so

636
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,440
they're taking a much more focused

637
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,679
approach same idea same proof of

638
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,039
coverage

639
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,440
mechanism that helium has but what

640
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,400
pollen does is they actually just do

641
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,520
cellular communications and

642
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,679
they actually give you ecem so if you

643
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,080
have an iphone 11 or newer or most

644
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,039
android phones from fall of last year to

645
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,280
this year if they support band 48 which

646
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,200
you can look up online they actually

647
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,520
participate in this network and because

648
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,600
you you have multiple sims that

649
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,919
secondary sim is also active as well and

650
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,720
that secondary sim will listen on band

651
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,520
48 the cbrs spectrum and if it

652
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,360
seasonally sell sites you get rewarded

653
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,559
because you

654
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,559
confirmed it's actually in that area

655
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,200
they can actually see it

656
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,400
so

657
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,440
they've taken a slightly different

658
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,559
approach

659
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,159
uh with it um they also use some

660
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,159
different terminology cell sites are

661
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,039
flowers validators with you know people

662
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,960
who who validate the coverage with sim

663
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,120
cards are called bumblebees it's kind of

664
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,600
funny the terminology they use

665
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,440
but they're they're very focused on

666
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,080
cellular communications um

667
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,919
some of the most exciting news is really

668
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,200
the partnerships because these are great

669
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,880
projects on their own but

670
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,960
what's going to make them successful in

671
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,120
the long term is going to be actual

672
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,559
normal people using these whether they

673
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,679
know it or not

674
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,200
so there's been a lot of partnership

675
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
announcements recently

676
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,120
so helium network plans to launch their

677
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
cellular network this fall and they've

678
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,320
already secured a roaming agreement um

679
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,559
with boost mobile

680
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,640
and a couple other nvme providers so

681
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,280
fairly low bandwidth um they've also got

682
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,200
a couple aminos i've never heard of

683
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,960
for for data only sim cards

684
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,240
also

685
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,600
microsoft has now partnered up with the

686
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,120
healing network so if you build an iot

687
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,720
device you're looking for an

688
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,280
international iot network that

689
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,600
tends to be more affordable

690
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,159
you can do that natively

691
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,320
working with them so you can build an it

692
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,520
device

693
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,440
on their azure iot platform and just

694
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,640
select

695
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,000
helium as well the networks that you use

696
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
for wireless communications so it's very

697
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,520
easy it's very quick that's very

698
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
affordable and these partnerships that

699
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,480
come up

700
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,280
they also work with flying scooters

701
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,880
i learned this we actually have iot

702
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,960
mouse traps now so when they go off and

703
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,360
say hey i caught a mouse it uses the

704
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,640
helium network

705
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,360
that's crazy so i've tried to talk to

706
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,200
local companies in wisconsin who i think

707
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,799
could take advantage of this

708
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,840
um

709
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,880
for iot style communications for

710
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,120
either household appliances

711
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,720
or for

712
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,400
kind of uh

713
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,000
energy

714
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,440
i want to say independence energy

715
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,640
diversity

716
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
who want to have like another network

717
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,559
maybe outside of a cellular network to

718
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,039
communicate on

719
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,600
that may be more affordable but this is

720
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,159
still very new has been wong has been

721
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,320
around that long and most enterprises

722
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
are very reluctant

723
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,120
to consider these as viable alternatives

724
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,720
because they're so new which you know i

725
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,880
think makes some sense but

726
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,279
in my opinion if they keep on growing

727
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,279
and the economics makes sense and they

728
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,799
are reliable

729
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:37,840
um

730
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,919
they are eventually

731
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,600
going to start getting some bigger and

732
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,039
bigger partnerships the balls already

733
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,159
start rolling it's just going to

734
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,320
accelerate over the next couple of years

735
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,520
so

736
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,360
i mentioned here i'm one of those kind

737
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,520
of multi-service operators i simplify

738
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,600
all this i have the equipment on hand

739
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,440
i help install it i buy somewhere to put

740
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,039
it so

741
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,320
for instance here this is what it looks

742
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,400
like when i check it out so

743
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,520
i will do kind of a remote

744
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,440
what they call a remote site survey and

745
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,559
what i do

746
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,039
is i kind of see

747
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,919
how can one node talk to another and

748
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,200
look at that coverage and a lot of this

749
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,640
depends on height

750
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,240
of these units where their antennas are

751
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,520
at

752
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
as well as the natural topography of the

753
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,080
land but

754
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,440
the real thing that matters with all

755
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,600
this is how many are there

756
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,200
if there are too many in a small area

757
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,480
they have to share their rewards and

758
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,159
make a lot less and that's designed and

759
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,360
built in like if there's already

760
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,400
coverage there you don't need another

761
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,240
one

762
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,080
so there's kind of sweet spots that you

763
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,200
want to check out and that's where you

764
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,919
get the most reward

765
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,840
and these kind of remote site survey

766
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,200
services that are out there some are

767
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,279
free some are paid allow you to kind of

768
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,799
do this to see

769
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,400
what is the map of the land where

770
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,919
they're going to install it and kind of

771
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,760
give you a fairly reliable estimate of

772
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,400
what you're going to make

773
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,640
so find good locations

774
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,480
uh find the owner whether that's uh

775
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,080
that's a landlord someone with a private

776
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,520
piece of property

777
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,520
somebody has a lot of tall trees

778
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,520
um a business a lot of people are

779
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
focusing on indoor as well especially

780
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,240
with

781
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,720
the cellular networks people are

782
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,159
expecting more partnerships to be

783
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,240
announced so they're saying hey your

784
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,000
business can make extra

785
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
quote-unquote fairly passive income

786
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,120
because a lot of these are set and

787
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,799
forget it they do remote software

788
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,720
upgrades we do remote troubleshooting

789
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,640
and you get additional income

790
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,320
the only price you have is bandwidth

791
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,240
which you already have an internet

792
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,919
connection or something like that

793
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,400
that's no additional cost and internet

794
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,159
uh depending which miner you buy that

795
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,159
can be four dollars

796
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,159
a year to you know 10 20 bucks a month

797
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,919
depends how much power they're using and

798
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,600
how big of an install they have

799
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,440
but it tends to be a win-win for

800
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,840
everybody

801
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,440
so

802
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,960
because this network is public anyone

803
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,080
can see

804
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,679
roughly where they're at

805
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,039
you can see what all these different

806
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,360
names make and all the names are random

807
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,440
um of all these hotspots you can go to

808
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,600
this explorer site today and see where

809
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,240
all these uh different locations make

810
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,120
and

811
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,200
uh from my experience you know that i

812
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,880
talked about quality of the install what

813
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,159
i really need is height for the install

814
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,159
height of the antenna and using good

815
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,760
quality um kind of antenna lines like uh

816
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,520
lmr 400 is the most popular one because

817
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,760
it has the least amount of loss

818
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,760
to make sure that you good strong

819
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,200
consistent signal

820
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,480
will help you earn the most rewards

821
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,440
i you know

822
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,080
how do these operators make money

823
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,360
well

824
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,679
these numbers are you know with

825
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,880
what's happening this week the numbers

826
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,919
are a little bit lower because uh

827
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,320
crypto's dropped in price but

828
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,400
um basically you try to you know i try

829
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,760
to make it so that the person at least

830
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,600
if it's a residential install they at

831
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,880
least make enough to make a debt in

832
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,240
their internet cost

833
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,679
and then from there we split the

834
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,559
earnings so they make that

835
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,480
and from an operator point of view you

836
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,600
want to pay off the equipment that

837
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,279
you've installed with them

838
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,720
but after that

839
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,600
it's fairly passive there's a variety of

840
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
large operators out there

841
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,240
some split 20 some split 50 some split

842
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,080
70 some split 80.

843
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,080
um some if as long as it's online for

844
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,679
two years and they make enough money

845
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,960
they give it to you so that will

846
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,799
actually transfer ownership of it to you

847
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,440
which is extremely generous

848
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,120
and in my opinion

849
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,559
i was like coming from telecom i was

850
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,679
like that's just like mind-blowing

851
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,200
they'd never do that

852
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,520
that ever that they're like why would we

853
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,640
want to

854
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,960
you know give ownership of these assets

855
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,320
to our customer that doesn't make any

856
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,360
sense

857
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,640
it makes sense if you want to grow the

858
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,399
network and you're not purely looking at

859
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,960
it at profit in some cases

860
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,840
so

861
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,760
uh i mentioned in the beginning like

862
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,080
you're really trying to

863
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,440
as a part of one of these projects

864
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,559
trying to bring up the cost of wireless

865
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,559
connectivity everywhere in the world

866
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,120
it's it's the best here in the us due to

867
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,679
regulatory reasons um

868
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,120
but it's really interesting you know

869
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,640
thinking about this from the project's

870
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,840
point of view whether it's helium or

871
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,039
pollen because

872
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,080
then

873
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,520
they basically are getting infinite

874
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,520
bandwidth and in aggregate not at every

875
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,200
site obviously people aren't going to

876
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,960
have um infinite

877
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,440
bandwidth on residential spectrum

878
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,159
but

879
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,000
they are going to be able to have

880
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,240
the ability as a project overall to say

881
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,080
yes you know if you're an iot device we

882
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,520
are confident it's going to be reliable

883
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,880
it's going to be available

884
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,000
um and you're going to have all the

885
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,399
bandwidth that you need

886
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,480
so um and they do built-in have some

887
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,080
built-in redundancy in the protocol so

888
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,320
that let's see the nearest hotspot to

889
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,360
you

890
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,120
doesn't have enough bandwidth so it will

891
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,720
actually forward those packets to its

892
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,240
nearby neighbors and they have more

893
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,159
bandwidth so there is there's some

894
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,360
protocol

895
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,600
kind of redundancy built in

896
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,720
downsides well there's plenty of

897
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,960
downsides

898
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,600
besides it um you know being associated

899
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,279
with blockchain or crypto um you can't

900
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,399
control the quality of the install

901
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,080
people who buy these and this is another

902
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,600
thing going through telecoms it's just

903
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,000
crazy they never allow is they they

904
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,520
don't control where you play you can buy

905
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,799
one of these put in the basement and put

906
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,399
in the first floor by the window you can

907
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,679
put it in the kitchen

908
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,039
those aren't good places to put it but

909
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:57,840
you can put it there you're not going to

910
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,799
make much

911
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,600
uh

912
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,960
and also if you put it on the roof you

913
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,799
buy a cheap antenna off ebay you do that

914
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,799
as well um you're gonna have problems

915
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,159
you put more noise on the network and

916
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,919
lower the quality of the network the

917
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,279
ability to use it but they don't they

918
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,799
don't control that they try to just

919
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,159
influence that through the rewards

920
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,159
mechanism

921
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,559
they can't tell you oh well you actually

922
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,559
have a cellular

923
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,559
a cellular unit

924
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,559
you better have at least 100 meg of

925
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,720
symmetric internet so up and down

926
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,039
um don't do that either so if you're

927
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,640
using the service and let's say your

928
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,480
cell phone says well i want to download

929
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,760
a big file or stream you know in 4k

930
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,880
might not be able to support that

931
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,240
in gaming something i mentioned a little

932
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,520
bit here and there

933
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,039
gaming is a big issue still with all

934
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,200
these networks people who are studying

935
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,960
the white papers taking apart this

936
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,039
equipment looking at the code are

937
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,960
finding multiple ways to

938
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,039
get these utility tokens

939
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,039
without actually helping the network

940
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,240
grow or improving the quality of the

941
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,520
network so

942
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,200
that's a that's an ongoing issue they

943
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,960
are getting better they are innovating

944
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,240
they are banning

945
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,240
groups and manufacturers

946
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,919
groups of users who are working together

947
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,200
to kind of defeat the purpose of

948
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,600
networking

949
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,159
and i think that's the ongoing thing

950
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,840
they just keep raising the bar

951
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,679
there is no secure network it just gets

952
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,919
better

953
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,440
so

954
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,720
i mentioned the beginning like this is

955
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,120
the part one uh so in my

956
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,880
my opinion this wireless connectivity

957
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,960
kind of revolution is just beginning

958
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,600
this will make it um in my opinion in

959
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,120
the next several years

960
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,039
more affordable i give you more choices

961
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,960
to where you get wireless services from

962
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,720
if they are successful which is a big

963
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,640
big if

964
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,159
but what do you do once you have

965
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,080
affordable ubiquitous communication you

966
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,919
need to use it somehow

967
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,320
you have applications that use it

968
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,480
there are other projects coming up that

969
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,000
are focusing on edge compute and

970
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,240
distributed edge compute to where anyone

971
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,720
can throw up a server and say now we're

972
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,919
competing with

973
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,880
azure cloud with google cloud aws those

974
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,159
projects there's multiple of them

975
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,519
already in the works

976
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,960
those are much smaller much less

977
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,720
well-known but they are coming to say

978
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,399
well if you have fairly infinite

979
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,000
bandwidth we're going to give you

980
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,080
infinite compute

981
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,000
at low prices and anyone can participate

982
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,519
within that as well

983
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,360
and i think that's in the next five to

984
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,279
ten years going to start working this

985
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,679
today they're so early they can't even

986
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,600
think about working together directly in

987
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,120
most cases but that's where i think it's

988
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,279
going

989
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
so

990
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,159
thank you for kind of listening to me

991
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,600
talk about this

992
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,279
kind of niche of

993
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,200
real world crypto or real world services

994
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,120
right by crypto networks um i didn't

995
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,840
mention i am i am a an operator

996
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,720
my site is up there uh if you're more

997
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,360
curious about this feel free to email me

998
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,519
or send me a vm on twitter

999
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,760
i'm not trying to grow my network i'm

1000
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,039
really trying to spread knowledge of how

1001
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,600
they work and why they're doing this for

1002
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,039
people who are interested and like i

1003
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,559
mentioned earlier we do have communities

1004
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,080
here in milwaukee madison throughout the

1005
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,320
state of people doing this the most

1006
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,720
common thing you see is somebody on a

1007
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,159
facebook marketplace going who wants a

1008
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,679
free minor

1009
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,279
and they split the income

1010
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,559
but with that i'm happy to answer any

1011
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,880
questions

1012
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,640
anything 1899 went over

1013
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,679
the cbrs frequency um

1014
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,760
what is that range

1015
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,559
yeah i think i had to go back to 750.

1016
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,640
right there

1017
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,159
35 fifty two three seven

1018
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,159
yes

1019
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,120
what's the price of one of these cells

1020
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,519
and how much is the electrical cost of

1021
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,519
running one yeah so that's a good

1022
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,159
question um so for a helium lorawan

1023
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,399
miner um the costs have drastically went

1024
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,640
down because the token price has crashed

1025
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,200
today it's about 350 per unit

1026
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,360
the electrical use is about four dollars

1027
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,678
a year

1028
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,240
right

1029
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,519
so that's what the lower wing is uh the

1030
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,279
cellular units use considerably more

1031
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,399
electricity

1032
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,679
that's going to be closer to probably

1033
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,760
ten dollars to twenty dollars a month

1034
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,520
um and those units are dramatically more

1035
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,879
expensive so

1036
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,320
those are going to range they'll start a

1037
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,000
thousand dollars and go up to seven

1038
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,599
thousand dollars today

1039
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,359
considerably more expensive

1040
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,679
also because of the

1041
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,199
band they have to use

1042
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,560
at best you're going to get like five to

1043
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,639
seven miles in range in ideal conditions

1044
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,960
i

1045
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,760
so

1046
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,040
as far as the you know what we're

1047
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,480
calling telecom the back hall or the

1048
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,639
internet connection a lot of these run

1049
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,560
on consumer today um and surprisingly um

1050
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,399
spectrum 18 t they know people are doing

1051
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,320
this they're doing d-packing inspection

1052
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,920
because they're too afraid of losing

1053
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,400
customers this is my opinion

1054
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,240
they are not banning people from using

1055
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,359
this because technically this is

1056
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,119
commercial service that people a lot of

1057
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,560
people are breaking their agreement on

1058
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,400
and using for commercial service

1059
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,240
as of today

1060
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,040
i have not seen any carrier in the world

1061
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,640
cancel people's internet for this but

1062
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,880
that is a risk

1063
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,520
i'm just asking for between each node if

1064
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,040
i have a large space desert and i want

1065
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,000
to uh

1066
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,079
change that to get internet output can

1067
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,520
that be done wirelessly no okay no not

1068
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,680
natively they should each have their own

1069
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,560
wire uh wired or wireless backhoe

1070
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,800
yeah but daisy chaining them there are

1071
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,480
some manufacturers working on that

1072
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,040
technology

1073
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,119
however um as of today none of them have

1074
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,960
launched a test net or production

1075
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,040
network

1076
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,160
yeah

1077
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,000
you said the keywords before commercial

1078
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
service

1079
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,599
there's a lot of work changing people

1080
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,280
are having to buy equipment

1081
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,040
people are earning tokens the project

1082
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,040
creators that you're getting some money

1083
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,640
users are having to pay for this one way

1084
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,560
or another

1085
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,599
and it's already on free spectrum why

1086
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,680
should this commercial service exist on

1087
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,839
free spectrum

1088
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,000
the fcc allows it um the idea is that

1089
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,680
they want to spur innovation they

1090
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,760
actually support the mission of the

1091
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,440
spectrum to bring down cost of

1092
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,119
commercial service so that's why they're

1093
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,320
on board which

1094
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,440
is also pretty incredible

1095
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,280
it's not like you know okay like the 2.4

1096
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,440
or 5 gigahertz band for wi-fi they

1097
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,000
actually want to be used commercial um

1098
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,359
for this but i mean that's used

1099
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,960
commercially as well a lot of wireless

1100
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,760
isps use that space

1101
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,680
yeah so if i want to consume this

1102
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,160
service just as an individual

1103
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,520
is there like

1104
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,359
a company i can roll up to be like

1105
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,240
here's your sim card you can now

1106
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,200
go on the helium network yes um so

1107
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,320
actually the hidden network has a

1108
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,480
dedicated space they have recommended

1109
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,040
hardware builds kits manufacturers and

1110
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,880
code examples you can have this up and

1111
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,240
running in an hour

1112
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,320
but i mean like literally for like my

1113
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,359
own

1114
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,160
my laptop like i want to use the network

1115
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,760
to do what i want to do got so um

1116
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,480
you want to use a sim card for for data

1117
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,880
access right yeah

1118
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,880
today you can't do that

1119
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,400
pollen is the only one that has

1120
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,680
production

1121
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,160
cellular service and today they only

1122
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,599
have e-sims you have to have e-sim

1123
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,400
compatible hardware um

1124
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,520
they're

1125
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,760
helium is launching with physical sims

1126
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,760
they're fifty dollars each uh this fall

1127
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,119
it's where you can use it

1128
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,760
as a data only network

1129
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,520
right so in telecom um

1130
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,280
right you have seamless handover over

1131
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,920
mostly the s1 protocol uh between cell

1132
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,680
sites um

1133
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,000
the the technical what these are

1134
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,040
actually

1135
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,000
it's kind of funny um each hot each

1136
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,040
hotspot microcell in cellular today is

1137
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,400
actually a

1138
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,079
technically a different network with a

1139
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,240
different mobile core so when they do a

1140
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,000
handoff they're actually handing off to

1141
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,400
a separate network between cells versus

1142
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,520
if you're on verizon they're just

1143
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,800
handing to the same cell within the same

1144
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,359
network so the handovers aren't as clean

1145
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,640
and seamless

1146
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,040
they do they do work however but they

1147
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,119
they tend to be a little slower but yes

1148
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,160
you hand over between cells

1149
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,079
in the next two years they are planning

1150
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,960
to launch a shared cloud core

1151
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,240
but that is still pretty far out

1152
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,079
so what they're actually using under the

1153
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,920
hood is what's called the magma open

1154
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,720
source

1155
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,560
lte core project

1156
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,920
so when they put up one of these nodes

1157
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,640
it's not just um the the enormous b so

1158
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,960
the cell site and the antenna they also

1159
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,880
put the entire mobile core

1160
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,400
actually in a computer that attaches

1161
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,880
that as well so it's actually an entire

1162
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,960
network

1163
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,280
but that network um all the billing

1164
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,000
information um is integrated directly

1165
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,400
with the the main healing protocol

1166
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,200
so you get your tokens paid based on

1167
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,160
um based on data transfers as well as

1168
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,359
other

1169
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,240
um other sites are able to see activity

1170
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,359
from the course so even though they're

1171
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,960
separate cores here's the crazy part

1172
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,880
they actually have the same network id

1173
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,150
so it's it's very pledging

1174
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,119
[Music]

1175
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,720
so you mentioned um something in the uh

1176
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,800
in a load balancing scenario where one

1177
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,119
node has uh low bandwidth and they have

1178
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,440
to hand it off to another another itself

1179
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,720
how does that

1180
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,400
expand on that a little bit yeah that's

1181
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,560
on the lorawan

1182
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,640
helium network so

1183
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,240
it is possible for one to be up and

1184
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,720
maybe briefly lost internet

1185
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,480
it can actually retransmit that to

1186
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,640
nearby cells and say i'm forwarding this

1187
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,000
to you

1188
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,240
[Music]

1189
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,079
a consequence of doing that however is

1190
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,839
that you will not earn before that data

1191
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,000
transfer since you are brokering yet not

1192
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,320
actually allowing it to hand off to the

1193
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,040
republican internet's got a potential

1194
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,079
range

1195
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,040
i think

1196
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,759
they've gotten high enough

1197
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,680
yeah the one in my attic was 20 miles

1198
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,240
so it's got significant range with with

1199
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,920
extremely low power

1200
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,400
the most i've seen is a kilometer but

1201
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,800
that's pretty crazy that's usually

1202
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,599
bouncing over the water

1203
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,119
and how much power is it

1204
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,839
the same thing four dollars a year

1205
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,119
oh how am i pulling

1206
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,520
how many watts

1207
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,680
oh the actual power of the unit um so

1208
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,560
they uh those are under uh those maxed

1209
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,640
out a lot but they're typically using

1210
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,839
less than that that's at full power

1211
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,079
so uh laura land right now are almost

1212
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,680
universally omni

1213
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,599
um for the cellular networks they are

1214
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,520
directional

1215
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,119
um there are some omni as well but um

1216
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,000
those tend to do a traditional telecom

1217
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,520
like a three sector or two second design

1218
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,920
all right i think that's it

1219
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,119
well appreciate everybody coming

1220
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,880
hopefully i um

1221
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,079
help you learn a little bit more about

1222
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,599
what's going on early backyards here in

1223
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,000
wisconsin but about some actually real

1224
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,599
world services going on uh hopefully

1225
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,359
blockchain for good but uh we've got a

1226
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,200
long way to go appreciate talking with

1227
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,040
everybody today if you want to learn

1228
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,880
more or talk to me in person i plan to

1229
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,720
be over at blockchain village most of

1230
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,160
the day today

1231
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,160
