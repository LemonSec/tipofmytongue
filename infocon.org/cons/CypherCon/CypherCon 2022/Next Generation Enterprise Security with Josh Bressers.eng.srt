3
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:29,238
[Music]

4
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,218
all right

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,460
foreign

6
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,960
how many of you are familiar with Star

7
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,240
Trek the Next Generation

8
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,979
that's a lot of hands I like that okay

9
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,860
good I don't want to single people up

10
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,799
now you are welcome to Heckle you are

11
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,380
welcome to interrupt and ask questions

12
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,540
whatever you feel like is fine I will

13
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,840
give you a warning I quite likely left

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,880
out your favorite episode because

15
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,979
there's a lot of Star Trek and I did my

16
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:26,880
best

17
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,340
to talk about the things I thought were

18
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,799
funny so this is not a serious talk in

19
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,680
any way and if you're easily offended

20
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,979
please leave

21
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:39,659
it's meant to be fun and it has been so

22
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,100
much fun working on it all right so

23
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,560
let's get cracking then

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,680
so who am I my name is Josh pressers I

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,420
work at a company called Encore actually

26
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,100
my company gave me some swag which I put

27
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,720
on a chair in the back and it looks like

28
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,899
most of it's gone now so if there's

29
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,060
anything on the chair in the back you're

30
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,439
welcome to it

31
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,720
so I work at a small startup called

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,240
Encore we do supply chain things I am a

33
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,700
huge open source security nerd I've been

34
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,200
doing open source security forever I

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,479
worked at red hat for a decade I worked

36
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,000
in elastic before that I'm an incor now

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,800
so the only thing I'd like more than

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,319
Star Trek is nerding out about open

39
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,060
source security so feel free to talk to

40
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,040
me about either of those things I'm Josh

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,440
brasser is on the socials like say hi I

42
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,879
love interacting with people let me

43
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,440
answer the questions Heckle me on

44
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,840
Twitter I love it and I also host two

45
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,340
podcasts one is called the open source

46
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,540
security podcast I've been doing that

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,160
one for a really really long time and

48
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,360
the other is called the hacker History

49
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,120
Podcast I do hacker history as part of

50
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,640
ciphercon which I'm yelling at Mike

51
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,800
later when he's not so stressed out

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,200
about not putting it in the program but

53
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,640
there is a podcast called hacker history

54
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,400
everyone is welcome to be a guest

55
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,800
everyone has a fabulous story to tell if

56
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,000
you just thought my story isn't

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,280
interesting every person I have talked

58
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,840
to on the higher credit history podcast

59
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,239
so far has told me those exact words it

60
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,640
is always a lie so by all means reach

61
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,800
out tell your story we all have amazing

62
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,000
stories is a ton of fun

63
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,359
are we good yeah

64
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,319
so what did I do right I make bad

65
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,000
choices that's what I originally titled

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,920
this slide and then my the people who

67
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,239
reviewed it said you shouldn't say that

68
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,180
but I watch all of the Next Generation

69
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,060
so the way this worked is I originally

70
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,739
thought of the title of this

71
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,659
presentation and I thought it would be

72
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,819
very very clever and then I thought I

73
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,260
figured okay I need to actually watch

74
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,180
Star Trek now and take notes and figure

75
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,860
out what the talk is actually going to

76
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,840
be about now that I have a clever title

77
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,140
there are 179 episodes of The Next

78
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,299
Generation right it's like 120 hours if

79
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,220
you're doing the math give or take I

80
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,680
watched this at least four times all the

81
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,940
way through putting this together it

82
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,379
sounds like a really cool idea and

83
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,299
something really easy to do but it's not

84
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,040
like you just watch Star Trek and then

85
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,540
you're done right you take notes you

86
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,819
rewind you re-watch you watch an episode

87
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,379
later and then you think back to

88
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,599
something that happened earlier and it

89
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,040
took forever it took me literally about

90
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,780
two years because real life kept getting

91
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,480
in the way but about two years of

92
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,299
watching Star Trek and taking notes and

93
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,920
then I was going to do this talk at the

94
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,840
last ciphercon and then the pandemic

95
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,180
Camp so you figure that was in 2020

96
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,000
we're 2022 now so I'm four years into

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,680
this talk I was becoming concerned that

98
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,260
it was cursed at one point so I'm I'm

99
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,940
not done yet but I'm I'm pretty sure

100
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,979
we're good now so anyway it was a ton of

101
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,960
work and it was totally worth it I

102
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,660
absolutely adored every moment of it so

103
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,060
what happened right I noted things like

104
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,880
the threats in the episodes potential

105
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,400
mitigations that could have helped out I

106
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,080
look at like what did the Enterprise

107
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,860
crew do and just start figuring out like

108
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,419
what does this mean and this isn't

109
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,340
scientific by any means I'm you are

110
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,919
welcome to disagree with me I am not

111
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,720
doing something that I'm going to say

112
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,340
like this is absolutely what happened

113
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,780
you know this is this is my

114
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,600
interpretation of a well-written science

115
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,220
fiction show will say and that point is

116
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,020
probably debatable by everybody so

117
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,780
anyway 178 threads ended up in my data

118
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,759
Nine episodes had no threats there's a

119
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,740
bunch of like crack filler episodes that

120
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,240
nothing really happens in those are

121
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,699
basically those but I think the most

122
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,639
interesting data point is 54 Insider

123
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,280
threats most of them are Wesleyan data

124
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,259
which surprise nobody but there are yeah

125
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,880
54 of the incidents are caused by

126
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,979
Enterprise insiders which I don't think

127
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,720
is unlike the real world right we all

128
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,880
have organizations we all have consider

129
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,639
threats so not terribly surprised

130
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,440
I took the

131
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,180
all the threats I put them in a

132
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,860
spreadsheet and this is I don't know if

133
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,100
you can read the the writing on the side

134
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,740
it's very hard to read but the big the

135
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,539
big line is just a catch-all I call

136
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,380
aliens that's uh 73. and so what that is

137
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,840
is there's lots of episodes that have

138
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,699
just like some random alien that does

139
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,620
something weird and that's what that is

140
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,180
because at first I started breaking them

141
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,380
all out and I realized like this is

142
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,639
stupid and it's going to be too much

143
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,740
work but then the number two is romulans

144
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,360
no surprise right anyone who's a Star

145
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,220
Trek fan knows that romulans are the

146
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,740
historic enemy of the Federation

147
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,320
basically the Soviet Union right back in

148
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,840
the early 60s when we were spelling all

149
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,720
this up Klingons come next data is after

150
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,600
Klingon so data is the basically the

151
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,340
third most dangerous thing they

152
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,300
encounter in big surprise

153
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,020
ah then Ferengi then Q then the

154
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,780
Enterprise itself the ship actually is a

155
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,639
danger to itself on multiple occasions

156
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,259
like we'll talk about the time it

157
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,979
becomes sentient and takes over but uh

158
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:36,840
I'm not making that up uh then Wesley

159
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,819
comes after the Enterprise no surprise

160
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,120
there right and then I can't read the

161
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,100
other two the other Kardashians thank

162
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,020
you and then humans themselves so the

163
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,020
Kardashians I suspect would be higher up

164
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,699
if they weren't introduced so late in

165
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:51,720
the series for those of you who don't

166
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,479
know there was a spin-off show called

167
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,860
Deep Space Nine we'll talk about it

168
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,660
comes up later on in the time but in

169
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,880
Deep Space Nine there's a new villain

170
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,620
called the Kardashians which are just

171
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,539
kind of basically the romulans but they

172
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,220
look different and so they they were

173
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,539
introduced very late in the show though

174
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,460
but I had a strong suspicion had there

175
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,840
been no Deep Space Nine all of the

176
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,160
cardassian threats would have just been

177
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,440
wrong but anyway all right quick

178
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,479
observations right

179
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,539
this ship has no Authentication

180
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,419
like for real and occasionally there's

181
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,639
passwords they're always terrible like

182
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,319
there's these crap like one one a or

183
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,639
something if they use voice but

184
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,500
generally speaking if these people hit

185
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,840
Yuba Keys like 90 of their problems

186
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,060
would just go away

187
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,919
yeah which is which is something right

188
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:39,900
sandboxing still doesn't work you know

189
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,520
we're all familiar with using sandbox is

190
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,860
to try to keep our adversaries in in the

191
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,199
24th century

192
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,220
nothing's better so I don't know if

193
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,560
that's good or bad probably bad uh my

194
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,539
favorite thing they do is so you know

195
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,099
they all wear those little communicators

196
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,139
on their on their shirts which are

197
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,259
uniforms and the communicator is how

198
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,580
they talk to each other but it's also

199
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,199
how they get trapped in the ship if you

200
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,240
take that off no one can find you on the

201
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,039
ship which seems ridiculous because they

202
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,479
can scan the ship for anything except

203
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,300
humans apparently which is a hilarious

204
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,340
problem later on and then my favorite

205
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,400
the guy in the picture is Lieutenant

206
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,860
Commander Wharf he is the head of

207
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,979
security I don't know what he does for

208
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:23,039
his job says it's clearly not security I

209
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,440
think if you look at most organizations

210
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,419
you hire the ciso to fire them when

211
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,879
something happens right he keeps his job

212
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,599
for seven years and he's incompetent

213
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,760
so anyway and I found a funny cowboy

214
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,339
picture of him which is the best okay so

215
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:39,958
we'll start with some of the simple easy

216
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,580
fun Insider threats the Holodeck right

217
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,560
they don't know what sandboxing is they

218
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,779
clearly never try they repeatedly have

219
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,060
issues with the Holodeck the character

220
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,640
in the upper right that's Professor

221
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,580
Moriarty from Sherlock Holmes he gained

222
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,420
sanctions and takes over the ship twice

223
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,620
which you think you've learned the first

224
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,240
time but no no we're not going to learn

225
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,880
right uh data they hook up data takes

226
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,860
over the Holodeck at one point the

227
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,720
Holodeck takes over the Holodeck at one

228
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,279
point when the shift becomes self-aware

229
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,279
and and creates a new life and I love it

230
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,720
that this every time something goes

231
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,160
wrong the safeties are disabled it's

232
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,260
supposed to be a safe place for us to

233
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,180
all go right where you go you have your

234
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,060
fun nothing bad happens except every

235
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,160
time someone sneezes the safeties are

236
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,600
disabled and they can start shooting you

237
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,980
and beating you up and killing people

238
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,420
and it's just like

239
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,480
you'd think it wouldn't be that hard to

240
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,519
maybe just like not disable I don't know

241
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,260
these people are morons that's going to

242
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,120
be the consistency throughout the

243
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,200
entirety of this talk

244
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,260
data is the number one Insider threat on

245
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,720
this ship by far right and I'd say if

246
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,220
you're going to break it down number one

247
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,040
stop hooking the damn robot up to the

248
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,440
ship that's a pretty easy one because it

249
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,120
repeatedly happens every time they hook

250
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,399
them up to something Madness right not

251
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,839
granted it's good storytelling my

252
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,279
version of Star Trek would be extremely

253
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,459
boring I will end so by all means uh

254
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,680
two-factor off right data takes over the

255
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,000
ship at one point we'll actually talk

256
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,740
more in depth about that episode he

257
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,120
takes over the ship if they had

258
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,860
two-factor authentication he could have

259
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,060
taken over the ship it wouldn't be that

260
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,839
hard to

261
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,820
hard Androids more trouble than interns

262
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,380
I was told that to change intern to

263
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,000
Wesley could not defending internally so

264
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,740
if there are any interns here I

265
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,200
apologize for offending you and and then

266
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,839
Androids at least the sample size we

267
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,760
have of one they all have evil twins so

268
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,839
that's something we have to concern

269
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,120
ourselves with also

270
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,180
Wesley the intern right so for those of

271
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,640
you okay I want to clarify when I grew

272
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,560
up in the 90s I was young like Will

273
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,839
Wheaton was my hero so I picked on

274
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,940
Wesley a lot in this talk but like I

275
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,279
loved this guy when I was a kid but

276
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,019
basically in the first couple episodes

277
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,720
Wesley is just a menace to everyone and

278
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,519
everything on this ship he causes a ton

279
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,459
of problems he takes over the ship I

280
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,160
think twice once was sort of on purpose

281
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,600
the second time was sort of accidentally

282
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,680
and now later on though once he's not an

283
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,000
annoying child

284
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,100
becomes vaguely useful to the Enterprise

285
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,200
crew so he does help out a couple of

286
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,940
times so that kind of begs the question

287
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,779
is the the threat aspect of Wesley worse

288
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,600
than the I've helped out threat impacted

289
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,640
with I will leave that one up to the

290
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,040
audience I have some fun notable attacks

291
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,140
that happen in the show this is my

292
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,000
favorite slide in the deck

293
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,040
data exfiltration from a supply chain

294
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,940
attack

295
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,100
there is an episode and I work for a

296
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,600
supply chain company so like this

297
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,579
everyone loves this one I work with so

298
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,800
there is an episode where the guy

299
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,040
standing next to data his name is fajo

300
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,680
he collects rare items and he decides he

301
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,079
wants an Android there's only one well

302
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,519
there are technically two because data's

303
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,500
evil brother but he only knows about

304
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,260
Lionel said so fagio creates a supply

305
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,540
chain attack by poisoning the water on

306
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,860
some Planet I'm not going to try to

307
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,760
pronounce all these words because

308
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,320
they'll just screw it up he poisoned the

309
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,720
water and there's only one way to solve

310
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,200
the poison and he has the chemical that

311
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,660
can fix it so the Enterprise goes to him

312
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,760
you can't transport this chemical

313
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,220
because story and so they have to move

314
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,079
it on the shuttle and they have data

315
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,700
moving for them and then so what happens

316
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,440
is data moves a bunch of the stuff and

317
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,180
on the last trip they knock them out

318
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,519
they scan what he's made of which from a

319
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,779
supply chain attached right that's like

320
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,000
the bill of materials we've got here get

321
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,800
data's bill of materials put the right

322
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,019
amount of stuff in the ship in the

323
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,700
little shuttle put the shuttle up blow

324
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,500
it up Enterprise is like oh David's dead

325
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,720
for data and then they go and do their

326
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,399
thing right and then of course there's a

327
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,740
variety of events that happen but I this

328
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,779
amuses me to know it just because it was

329
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,420
like this crazy long time very Star Trek

330
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,700
all to kidnapping Android and then at

331
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,500
the very end of course everything goes

332
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,459
back to normal because that's what

333
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,440
happens at the end of Star Trek episodes

334
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,880
so

335
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,860
there's an insertion of malicious data

336
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,320
in the ship this one happens I I don't

337
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,940
I'm still not sure about the first one

338
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,519
is data's evil twin pretending to be

339
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,620
data does that count as an insertion of

340
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,540
a malicious data I think maybe maybe not

341
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,740
then there's the

342
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,380
then there's an episode where a guy

343
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,560
named IRA Graves takes over the Android

344
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,899
he he goes in he transfers his mind into

345
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,779
Data then acts like just a kind of jerk

346
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,220
and they figure it out eventually

347
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,079
there's the episode where an ancient

348
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,320
civilization takes over data and so this

349
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,360
again just amused me from the aspect if

350
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,440
we get to make a plan words with data

351
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,300
uh fishing we see a phishing attack

352
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,200
there's the the lady on the left is

353
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,940
Tashi Yar for those of you who don't

354
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,320
watch Hashi Yara was a head of security

355
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,560
in season one and then she came to an

356
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,540
untimely demise uh they heard actress

357
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,639
Denise Crosby and she didn't want to do

358
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,500
the show anymore and maybe she was

359
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,700
didn't want to be seen as the

360
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,019
incompetent head of security I don't

361
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,240
know but uh then dwarf takes over after

362
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,519
hurt and she dies and her sister shows

363
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,800
up in a later episode and and pretends

364
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,779
to be all friendly and nice and oh she

365
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,279
wants to get to know the the crew

366
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,440
because they knew Tasha and it turns out

367
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,420
she was just using them all for her own

368
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,700
not evil but we'll say questionable

369
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,240
means so it it resonated as a phishing

370
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,120
attack malware I love this one this

371
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,279
episode is called Contagion

372
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,440
so there's a sister ship to the

373
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,940
Enterprise which not everyone would know

374
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,980
it's called the Yamato it looks exactly

375
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,720
like the Enterprise which no doubt could

376
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,399
decrease the model budget when they were

377
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,639
filming this episode and the Yamato

378
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,560
catches a virus

379
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,079
and the Enterprise goes to help and they

380
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,579
talk to each other and everything's like

381
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,079
wigging out on the Yamato just like

382
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,519
you'd expect if you had some sort of

383
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,920
malware and then it explodes and then

384
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,839
everyone's like oh crap the Enterprise

385
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,240
catches the virus so now the Enterprise

386
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,800
is doing the same things and they're

387
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,899
freaking out because obviously they saw

388
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,279
what happened to the Yamada and they're

389
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,839
concerned they're going to blow up then

390
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,820
romulans show up and the romulans catch

391
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,160
the virus because I mean why not right

392
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,040
then eventually data catches the virus

393
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,100
when they go down to the planet and the

394
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,019
best part of this is data catches a

395
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,660
virus and the Android shuts itself off

396
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,639
and then starts itself back up again

397
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,860
later and everything's fine right it's

398
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,300
classic turn it off turn it back on

399
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,479
again

400
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,699
yeah right they didn't try that with the

401
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:19,560
ship and then data wakes up it's like oh

402
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,120
just turn the ship off and back on again

403
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,740
and everything will be fine and then

404
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,120
they did and everything was fine

405
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,500
from everything I've learned watching

406
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,579
this show

407
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:32,880
the tech in the 21st century is as bad

408
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,220
or worse than ours so I refuse to

409
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,600
believe these people don't just turn

410
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,920
things off and turn them back on again

411
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,260
as soon as anything goes wrong because

412
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,019
that's what we all do and 99 of the time

413
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,240
it works and then my favorite part is

414
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,579
they basically tell the romulans oh hey

415
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,500
uh you got to turn your ship off and on

416
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,660
again good luck we're out and then they

417
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,279
then they take off and we don't know

418
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,060
we'll assume they're wrong

419
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,860
a denial of service attack there's an

420
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,480
episode called night terrors which is

421
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,040
one of the most terrifying episodes of

422
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,860
Star Trek ever where nobody can dream

423
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,560
and there's these like anti-dream aliens

424
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,060
trying to send them a message and it

425
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,860
messes them all up they can't dream

426
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,199
everything gets super weird the only

427
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,060
actually one person can dream the the

428
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,160
greenish picture on the right is

429
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,899
counselor Troy she is a beta Zed which

430
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,940
has uh what's that oh thank you yes half

431
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,519
beta that half human half data is in and

432
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,120
she is an empath so apparently she has

433
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,060
the ability to sense the message from

434
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,220
the dream aliens but other people just

435
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,160
can't go to sleep and So eventually they

436
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,620
go through their their night terrors it

437
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,720
gets weird data actually helps

438
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,440
surprisingly you can't sleep yet and so

439
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,139
all in all everything works out and it

440
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:53,339
all goes back to normal at the end of

441
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,139
the episode right

442
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,940
social engineering this is one of my

443
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,860
favorites there's an episode called

444
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,259
data's day which is kind of a boring

445
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,759
episode except for the fact that there's

446
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,579
a Vulcan Ambassador on the ship and for

447
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,559
those of you who don't know if you look

448
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,859
back uh Spock Mr Spock right I'm sure

449
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,299
everyone knows Spock from the early

450
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,459
start Star Trek that's like just part of

451
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:17,160
the Zeitgeist about the pointy ears so

452
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,439
one of the plots in the early Star Trek

453
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,540
episodes is that the romulans look like

454
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,099
vultures and then of course everyone's

455
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,780
like oh Spock might be a Romulan even

456
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,799
though he's been on the ship for like

457
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,419
you know 20 years and he's always helped

458
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,540
out but so anyway romulans and Balkans

459
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,700
look like each other there's a Balkan

460
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,280
Ambassador on the ship at one point and

461
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,320
she's acting weird but Balkans are weird

462
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,960
so it's fine and then she goes to

463
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,880
transport to a Romulan ship to do

464
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,100
diplomatic something or other and dies

465
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,260
on the transport and then the Enterprise

466
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,840
being the astute solution they are they

467
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,640
figure out that she didn't die the

468
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,039
Romulan stole her so they go back to the

469
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,600
romulans and they say give us back our

470
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,760
ambassador and they go haha she's not an

471
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,220
ambassador she's a Romulan spy and so

472
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,020
now the social engineering aspect of

473
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,480
Star Trek though there's an amazing

474
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,039
amount of social engineering in this

475
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,960
show and it's it's all pretty good

476
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,640
actually it's really fun to watch and

477
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,679
see where they they kind of get sneaky

478
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,360
and trick people I didn't put a lot of

479
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,799
it in just because there's so much of it

480
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,220
I could easily write multiple hour-long

481
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,140
talks just on most of the social

482
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,760
engineering they do in this show it's

483
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,460
fascinating and it's really fun

484
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,440
there's an episode that's home alone in

485
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,400
space

486
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,440
this isn't has anything to do with

487
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,940
security I just really like it so I put

488
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,280
it in so there's an episode called

489
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,039
Starship Mine where they have to get I

490
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,960
think the bed bugs or something taken

491
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,880
off the ship and so they go to get like

492
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,460
some weird space beam sweep across the

493
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,500
ship and and remove whatever it is

494
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,980
that's wrong with it and Picard goes to

495
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,660
get his saddle which we find out he

496
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,280
likes to ride horses so that's actually

497
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,200
Wharf holding Picard saddle in the

498
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,640
middle picture because he lost it and

499
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,179
then they had to go find it

500
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:59,940
but they they basically uh card goes to

501
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,160
get a saddle he finds out the burglars

502
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,140
are on the ship trying to steal

503
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,580
something or other I don't remember what

504
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,799
he's picking up a crossbow in the

505
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,480
picture on the left and the picture on

506
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,220
the right is one of the explosions he

507
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,260
sets off to trick the Woodview burglars

508
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,020
and then at the end uh they I think I

509
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,400
think he kills them all and then

510
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,919
everything goes back to normal and yeah

511
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,780
just pretty classic Star Trek but it's

512
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,120
fun it's a great episode I love it

513
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,400
I also put together just some some

514
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,039
interesting events I took note of that

515
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,520
help explain some of what we see on this

516
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,320
show and some of it's just for fun like

517
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,700
this one in the very first episode

518
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,700
encounter at farpoint the guy Q who's

519
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,820
kind of dressed up like the old-timey

520
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,799
I don't know columbusey person I don't

521
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,260
know what to call that

522
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,820
what

523
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,059
Cyrano oh thank you cool okay that work

524
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,880
I'll go with that easterno and I learned

525
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
that from Authority just now and

526
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,080
basically he's chasing the ship and

527
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,520
doing his normal thing he's kind of a

528
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,220
pain we'll get to him later and at one

529
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,860
point when the queue is chasing the Ship

530
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,080
Captain Picard tells everyone over the

531
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,740
PA system that you need to use printouts

532
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,140
instead of the screens on the ship so

533
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,140
that the attacker can't read the screen

534
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,360
which is ridiculous to us now I think

535
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,640
like printing things out is somehow

536
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,740
safer than showing them on a screen I

537
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,880
don't think any of us would claim that

538
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,160
but I also think I I thought about this

539
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,440
one a lot and the reason I left it in is

540
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,559
this show debuted in the early 80s and I

541
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,600
think in the 80s if there was a computer

542
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,940
there was a printer next to it so I

543
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,980
think it was just a natural progression

544
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,260
that if computer then printer and for

545
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,120
whatever reason the writers decided that

546
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,000
printouts are safer than computers which

547
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,220
I don't know maybe maybe not doesn't

548
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,960
matter it just just amused me so I left

549
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,740
it

550
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,299
this is the episode though everyone says

551
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:56,520
why does the ship not have

552
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,380
authentication it's explained here

553
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,880
there's an episode called the neutral

554
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,580
zone data finds some Frozen humans the

555
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,100
doctor thaws them out and then just kind

556
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,320
of hilarity ensues as people from our

557
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,080
time end up in the 21st century and they

558
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,640
act like a bunch of morons and whatever

559
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,640
but at one point one of them calls the

560
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,280
captain on one of the ship panels and

561
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,679
the captain's like who is this why are

562
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,660
you talking to me and the guy's like you

563
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,919
need to come talk to me you know I'm

564
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:24,179
important or whatever

565
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,640
Picard goes to talk to this guy and he's

566
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,159
like never call me again and the guy

567
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:30,780
says well why don't you protect your

568
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,179
panels with a password or something and

569
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,220
Picard says that people in the future

570
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,559
don't mean passwords because they've

571
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:40,860
evolved Beyond needing that that is a

572
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,720
lie

573
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,760
everything we've seen in this show

574
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,340
before this episode and after proves

575
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,400
that humans have not evolved to be some

576
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,020
sort of species that doesn't need

577
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,500
passwords definitely a lie

578
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,020
there's this this one's great too so

579
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,820
it's an episode called evolution

580
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,980
Wesley's doing his homework and he

581
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,080
forgets to close the container holding

582
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,059
the the Nano Bots or whatever he's he's

583
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,760
using and they accidentally get out and

584
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,380
become sentient because things just

585
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,000
become sentient in Star Trek and that's

586
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,179
normal then they take over the ship and

587
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:16,740
of course the ship is everyone's

588
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,539
freaking out because the ship is is

589
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,700
being taken over by such a Nanobots that

590
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,880
the intern let go and then the solution

591
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,000
to this is they let the Nanobots infect

592
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,780
data so he can talk to them

593
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,580
what

594
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,860
no don't what just I I don't even know

595
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,720
what to say to this like I can't

596
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,940
parallel this is like saying there's an

597
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,460
attacker in the system uh attacker could

598
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,840
you take over the phone network so we

599
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,480
can talk to you like no don't don't do

600
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,820
that it's and these people are morons

601
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,780
that's that's the thing so now one of

602
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,760
the the best time data takes over the

603
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,039
ship is an episode called brothers and

604
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,919
this is it's a lot of poetry in this one

605
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,840
there's Brothers on the ship having an

606
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,700
incident data and his evil brother have

607
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,440
an incident down on the surface they

608
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,780
meet data's father it actually fun fact

609
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,700
I I scrubbed this episode I went through

610
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,380
it with a fine-tuned coma trying to find

611
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,400
a picture of data lore his evil twin and

612
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,559
uh Dr noonian soon who is the old dude

613
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,419
in that picture and then I realized

614
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:21,120
they're all the same person like I'm

615
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,679
never gonna see all three of them in the

616
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,240
same scene because that's just like well

617
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,919
beyond probably the budget the show had

618
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,720
way back in the day but that didn't stop

619
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,700
me from wasting more probably two hours

620
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,500
trying to find a frame so anyway data is

621
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,480
on the ship he like goes into this

622
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,299
trance he turns off the life support on

623
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:40,980
the bridge so all the humans have to

624
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,780
leave he's a robot he doesn't need to

625
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,760
breathe so he just stays there and

626
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,460
everyone leaves he locks the door they

627
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,919
can't get on the ship he takes over the

628
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,460
ship he mimics Picard's voice to lock

629
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,620
the computer which that I'm pointing to

630
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,000
a password that's a password that's

631
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,559
actually a pretty solid password I would

632
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,000
I would say that'll get like all the

633
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,500
green bars if you're using the password

634
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,320
oh meter right and so he locks a ship

635
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,179
with that password with Picard's voice

636
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:07,559
of course because that's normal

637
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:10,679
apparently and then he goes down to the

638
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:12,840
planet and they're trying to break back

639
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,760
into the bridge and it's just a big mess

640
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,140
and it's everything you can possibly

641
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,720
imagine and anyway then kind of at the

642
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,340
end everything just goes back to normal

643
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,200
like it always does in Star Trek and

644
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,360
they clearly did no postmortems they

645
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,520
didn't ask any questions about how did

646
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,220
any of these events happen they we see

647
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,720
this again where they get locked out of

648
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,080
the bridge again like these people suck

649
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,780
at security Wharf should not have a job

650
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,860
now there's another episode called

651
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,740
disaster everything like just fails the

652
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,200
computer the ship they like crash into

653
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,640
something no one knows what's going on

654
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,640
they have problems eventually Commander

655
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,700
Riker the second in command and Dana's

656
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,320
head only his head I won't tell you why

657
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,140
end up in engineering and they hooked

658
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,020
data's head up to the computer

659
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,940
but that was good because he actually

660
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,760
saved the ship so that time hooking data

661
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,200
up to the computer was okay we'll say

662
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,960
but only that time

663
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,820
there's this is this is another good one

664
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,900
the game

665
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,260
so this one I I think about a lot from

666
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,020
the just perspective of as a defender in

667
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,380
the industry so there is

668
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,140
a game that makes its way onto the ship

669
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,779
that when you play it it turns you evil

670
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,299
basically it turns you into a zombie of

671
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,700
some other alien race we never see again

672
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,340
which is a common theme in the show

673
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,100
the aliens take over most of the adults

674
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,279
the adults turn off data because data

675
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,080
apparently can't be taken over in this

676
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,580
one he does in other episodes but

677
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,100
whatever and then Wesley's like the only

678
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,260
person left and this is actually an

679
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,080
interesting incident where you have a a

680
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,320
good guy The Blue Team who has a ton of

681
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,720
internal knowledge and has to use their

682
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,200
knowledge to basically defend against

683
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,120
the all of the other insiders who have

684
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,740
turned evil and this is one of the ones

685
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,419
where Wesley takes off his com badge and

686
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:07,860
they're like oh no we can't find Wesley

687
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,240
anywhere on the ship everyone what are

688
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,260
we going to do

689
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,080
and they eventually find him after he

690
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,580
does a bunch of ridiculous things one of

691
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,080
the things he does is he turns data back

692
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,700
on so actually Wesley and data together

693
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,159
saved the day in this episode so that

694
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,779
was very interesting to me however it

695
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,220
makes you think like what would happen

696
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,380
if everyone turned evil and he was the

697
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,840
only good guy I don't know

698
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,539
another one I love this one conundrum

699
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:33,419
everyone loses their Memories We as the

700
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:35,520
viewers are aware that something is

701
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,400
wrong but none of these people do so

702
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,860
what happens is the Enterprise pulls up

703
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,080
to a ship there's like a bright flash of

704
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,840
light and then when everything comes

705
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,419
back we see this guy here that's a

706
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,520
commander McDuff which we've never seen

707
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,960
before but everyone's like oh

708
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,580
everything's fine because they don't

709
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,260
remember anything and the computer says

710
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,419
this guy's second in command and his

711
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:00,480
viewers were very confused but then it's

712
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,600
amusing to me because these aliens have

713
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,200
no technology capable of ending the war

714
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,400
they're in because what they want to do

715
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,480
is they want to take over the Enterprise

716
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,559
and use the Enterprises vast power to

717
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,900
just wipe out their enemy so they have

718
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,220
the technology to wipe everyone's Minds

719
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,419
modify the computer without being

720
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,720
detected and then insert themselves into

721
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,240
the ship and try to convince everyone to

722
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,500
go to this other planet and kill

723
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,760
everyone else

724
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,260
and it's like

725
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,480
you can do all those things and you just

726
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,220
like can't build a freaking bomber or

727
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,080
even just send your damn mind wiping

728
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,659
ship to the bad guy like it's it's

729
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,120
hilarious anyway the Enterprise goes and

730
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,580
and just sanity wins because they're

731
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,840
like wait a minute we can't kill all

732
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,100
these people like they have they have no

733
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,200
way to defend themselves and then they

734
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,880
shoot the bad guy and he looks like that

735
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,100
and everything goes back to normal again

736
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,919
and and this one I like because I think

737
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,500
uh if you had like anything resembling

738
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,260
backups or signed you know data

739
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,080
Integrity of your system or anything

740
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,840
then they don't have like them ah this

741
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,880
one is great fist full of datas

742
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,520
they hooked it up to the ship why not

743
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,640
and he takes over the Holodeck all the

744
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,279
carrot dwarf is there with his son and

745
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,460
counselor Troy reenacting a western and

746
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,900
so hence the name you know it's Fistful

747
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,700
of Dollars being the the old Western

748
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,100
Title Fistful of Davis here

749
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,080
they hooked it up to the computer data

750
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,960
takes over the ship and of course the

751
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,700
Holodeck safeties are disabled because

752
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,279
why wouldn't they be and so now you have

753
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,400
Commander War his son and the counselor

754
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,059
in the Holodeck up against a a bunch of

755
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,520
datas trying to kill them all and of

756
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,200
course they don't die because you just

757
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,400
don't kill people in the Star Trek

758
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,220
usually and then yeah at the end

759
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,320
everything goes back to normal and

760
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,240
nothing changes

761
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,760
because that's how we roll here this is

762
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,779
my favorite of all okay so data this

763
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,279
episode takes place on Deep Space Nine

764
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,140
okay so this is where kind of like the

765
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,240
Star Trek d59 crossover is one of those

766
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,220
ways of like Deep Space Nine ratings

767
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,559
suck we need to do something everyone so

768
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,480
they go to deep space the Enterprise

769
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,340
goes to Deep Space Nine

770
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,220
they find they found a device on a plan

771
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,720
right that like thing that's kind of

772
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,700
glowing there in the picture they found

773
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,720
that

774
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,520
and then they're like we should turn

775
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,460
this on and see what it does

776
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,899
and then of course data's standing in

777
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,059
front of it because why wouldn't you do

778
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,000
that he stands in front of it it zaps

779
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,679
them did they find it in the parking lot

780
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,919
it was on a planet in the camouflage it

781
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,440
might have been in a parking lot

782
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,440
all right no that's is that is it I

783
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,640
think you're right I think that is by

784
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,799
the war of course I did it well done

785
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,200
okay we're going after the center right

786
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,360
right yeah see these people are idiots

787
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,760
so anyway anyway they take this weird

788
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,159
unknown device they plug it in they turn

789
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,919
it on it zaps the robot robot starts to

790
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:00,779
dream which is a little weird oh granted

791
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:03,480
but whatever and then they wake data up

792
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,399
the data's like he's startled because

793
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:06,659
you know when you wake up from a dream

794
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:08,760
that's what happens to you and then

795
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,919
they're like I just had a dream I saw my

796
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:12,480
father they're talking about it and then

797
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,480
he's like we should do this again

798
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,580
and then they do it again

799
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,799
and then he drinks more which isn't it I

800
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:20,940
mean it's a very interesting story and

801
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,980
some of the dream episodes with data are

802
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,100
like chef's kiss in the show but

803
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,860
come on how many of us this is like the

804
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,840
classic Trope if you find a USB drive in

805
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,179
the parking lot right like go plug it in

806
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:34,320
I mean how many of you plug into your

807
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,960
cybercon flash drives yeah I plug mine

808
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,480
in I'm not gonna lie I run Linux though

809
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,340
so if I run Linux like I can't get my

810
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,779
stuff to work most of the time so I know

811
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:43,679
they're not going to get it to work

812
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,360
either but they do like that's cool

813
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,640
anyway there's it's fine there's there's

814
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,440
only the eCard test wires out there

815
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,580
you're fine

816
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,659
um go plug it into your corporate

817
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:52,620
Network

818
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,059
so anyway

819
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,580
they're more ads we'll keep going Max I

820
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,080
love this episode too just from a

821
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,580
storytelling perspective it's fabulous

822
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,980
they find an Alien Probe they scan the

823
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,020
Alien Probe the Alien Probe takes over

824
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,580
the ship and takes over data for some

825
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,299
reason

826
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:07,980
and then everything starts turning into

827
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,260
an Asian Temple and this again is one of

828
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,820
those incidents of like

829
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,980
what is wrong with you people validate

830
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,779
your damn inputs or something here how

831
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,640
do you scan something and get hacked

832
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,980
this is bananas but whatever it's just

833
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,940
what happens

834
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,240
and again this is one of those episodes

835
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,100
everything's crazy the ship is turning

836
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,659
into an ancient Temple there's one point

837
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:29,700
they were going to blow up the probe

838
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,720
which is in the picture in the middle

839
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,740
you see how big it is like the

840
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,059
Enterprise looks really small they're

841
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,220
gonna blow it up and they they get their

842
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,620
their Photon torpedo ready

843
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,220
and they they it turns to snakes like

844
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,659
it's just a weird episode but it's bad

845
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:45,059
it's fantastic uh what about some threat

846
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,100
modeling ideas right we love to talk

847
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,500
about some of the weird things the ship

848
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,179
has but what about some of the threats

849
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:53,399
we think about in real life uh there's

850
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:56,220
an episode where Picard best the devil

851
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,980
and it's it's a very good episode uh

852
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,720
there's if you there there's I put the

853
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,520
devil picture in because it's Top Notch

854
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,220
but there's a lady named Audra who goes

855
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,720
to a planet that apparently made a deal

856
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,279
with the devil thousands of years ago

857
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,799
and the devil came to collect on his bed

858
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,720
or her bed I guess in this case

859
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,120
and then the Enterprise shows up and the

860
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,620
devil claims oh we own the Enterprise

861
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,080
now too and she appears to have all

862
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,520
these powers and she claims she's the

863
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,640
devil and the solution is instead of a

864
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,279
fiddle competition they have a trial and

865
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,720
they put the Android in charge as a

866
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,419
judge and luckily they figure it out

867
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:31,799
because they Star Trek their way out of

868
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:32,760
it and at the end of the show everything

869
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,580
goes back to normal so it's fine but yep

870
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,919
yep I love it uh time Loops how many of

871
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,419
us have been stuck in a Time Loop for

872
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:42,140
two years maybe

873
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:44,580
this is a great episode too this is oh I

874
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,899
forget the name of it off the top of my

875
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:47,600
head doesn't matter what time what is it

876
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,820
well three is the message they send back

877
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,799
right is it three yeah it's three

878
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,020
because it's this episode if you've

879
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,399
never watched the entire you know the

880
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,779
name

881
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,460
common factor

882
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,919
cause and effect thank you I'm sorry yes

883
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,539
it's like one of the best stuff it's

884
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:05,220
probably my favorite Star Trek episode

885
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,320
by far cause of effect and they get

886
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,240
stuck in a Time Loop and it just made me

887
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,279
think about like sometimes these

888
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,140
security incidents truly feel like time

889
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,320
Loops I think log for Jay that was like

890
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,299
I felt like I lived the same day for two

891
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,460
months of my life when that happened and

892
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,779
I don't think that'll ever change with

893
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:23,880
this episode fantastic

894
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,980
uh what about unlimited beings how many

895
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,299
of us account for omnipotent beings and

896
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,340
our thread levels I don't think many of

897
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,080
us run into these this is where there's

898
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,419
a character named Q who appears about

899
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,399
once a season give or take and he just

900
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:37,620
causes General hilarity and Mayhem he's

901
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,539
an omnipotent being he harasses Captain

902
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:42,299
Carr it's fabulous every time he shows

903
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:43,919
up something ridiculous happens and I

904
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,019
absolutely love it but anyway it got me

905
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:47,940
thinking like what if we had an

906
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,220
omnipotent attacker what would we do I

907
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,140
don't know they need him every time just

908
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,919
by the way so it's possible

909
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,559
um Mark Twain Mark Twain is a threat in

910
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,140
the Star Trek universe

911
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,880
due to a series of events I won't get

912
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,500
into here because it takes too long to

913
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,659
explain they end up back in time and

914
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:08,280
they interact with Mark Twain who is

915
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,139
about as annoying as you'd expect Mark

916
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,580
Twain to be if you've ever read his

917
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,219
words and then eventually through a

918
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,040
series of hilarious events he ends up on

919
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,560
the Enterprise in the future and he of

920
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,359
course is annoying and weird and then

921
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,040
eventually he saves the day when they

922
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,599
send him back in time again after he

923
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,580
messed everything up and and they've got

924
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,679
it's it's a it's called Uh Time Zero

925
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,659
it's a two-part episode it is absolutely

926
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,940
fantastic and the guy who plays Mark

927
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,280
Twain is fabulous it's so good yeah he's

928
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,099
like he's such a jerk I love it uh Eagle

929
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:41,520
twins so in in the Next Generation I I

930
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,739
found two Riker has an evil well Riker's

931
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,418
twin isn't evil yet he gets evil so I

932
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,280
count that and then Dana has a brother

933
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,980
who's evil and very annoying and

934
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,260
actually the the episode with Dana's

935
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,119
evil twin called datalore is the famous

936
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:56,339
shutout Wesley that everyone references

937
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,500
all the time so you gotta love that

938
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,300
uh but anyway

939
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,119
what about if the competitions Nikes

940
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,040
your senior leadership for reactions

941
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,020
inside of knowledge right what happens

942
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,760
then

943
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,460
in in this particular episode the Borg

944
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,680
the Borg which we get and funny enough I

945
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,180
took out all of the board except this

946
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,040
the board could fill like 10 talks on

947
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,500
their own they're an awesome bad guy

948
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,619
that the humans always beat it's it's

949
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:24,720
one of those things that at the end of

950
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,119
Star Trek like every enemy they come up

951
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,460
against is easily defeated in an hour I

952
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,320
love it so anyway the board kidnapped

953
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,480
card they obviously gained access to all

954
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,160
of his knowledge and insight and then

955
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,780
they use that to their advantage when

956
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,000
attacking the earth and the Federation

957
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,520
and of course they kidnap a card back

958
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,859
eventually they

959
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:46,980
on board came a bit and then he uses his

960
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,720
board Insider knowledge to help them

961
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,720
defeat the board so haha touche board

962
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,820
but then they put him back in charge the

963
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,980
next day

964
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,920
I'm just saying if if I had leadership

965
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,060
who was kidnapped by an adversary

966
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,200
probably brainwashed definitely abused I

967
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,160
would not put them back in charge

968
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,500
immediately probably never but I'm just

969
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,300
saying this is Star Trek everything goes

970
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,280
back to normal everything is fine right

971
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,140
that's fine that's fine uh what about

972
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,119
ghosts how many years to come for ghosts

973
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:20,460
this is a terrible episode actually this

974
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,980
one uh this is

975
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,260
Dr Crusher is like the main character in

976
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,720
this her grandma dies her Grandma's in

977
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,980
love with the ghost that's her grandma

978
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,599
sort of coming back to life from the

979
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:31,619
ghost weird

980
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:33,060
um this episode sucks but there's a

981
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,400
ghost so it was funny if I left

982
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,440
uh what about attackers who only speak

983
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,099
in metaphors

984
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,510
if you know any

985
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,500
[Music]

986
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,680
anything darmok and Gillard at tanagra

987
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,000
and no one knows what the hell that

988
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,740
means they figure it out eventually

989
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,960
Picard and the other Captain become

990
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,579
friends after they kidnap a card and

991
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:57,839
send them to the planet and they fight

992
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,880
some elect like lightning monster or

993
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,740
something but the whole episode is

994
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,359
fabulous but it's one of those things

995
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,060
like what happens I don't know

996
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,280
what if the CEO is replaced by an exact

997
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,380
duplicate who acts weird there's an

998
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,320
episode where an alien species kidnapped

999
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,599
Captain Picard they put him in a jail

1000
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,579
cell with a bunch of other people in one

1001
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:19,140
of their plants is there which Picard of

1002
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,060
course figures out eventually and then

1003
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,800
they put a duplicate of a card on the

1004
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,140
ship who acts really really weird and

1005
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,700
then everyone figures it out they know

1006
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,380
there's something wrong

1007
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,760
um would you know though if your CEO act

1008
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,380
really weird does your CEO already act

1009
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,720
really weird just saying

1010
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,960
all right so now all that that was a lot

1011
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,079
of talk why did I do this I did it

1012
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,280
because I wanted to watch a lot of Star

1013
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,359
Trek

1014
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:44,339
but that's probably not a good enough

1015
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:46,020
reason but

1016
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,880
I think there is a lesson here for us

1017
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,280
and I I legitimately started this talk

1018
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,660
because I just wanted to watch a lot of

1019
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,220
Star Trek I'm not going to pretend I had

1020
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,079
some like higher meaning in all this I

1021
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,220
thought of the title name and thought

1022
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,300
I'm just going to watch a lot of Star

1023
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,260
Trek and I did and a lot like four years

1024
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,200
worth but I think there is a lesson here

1025
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,579
for us and it says security doesn't have

1026
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:07,079
to be boring necessarily like I've been

1027
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,839
talking for 37 minutes now about stupid

1028
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,579
hilarious Star Trek stuff and if you're

1029
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:13,800
a Star Trek fan this is super amusing

1030
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,500
this talk was so much fun to write I

1031
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,640
have been through it like a million

1032
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,960
times I've shown it to a bunch of

1033
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,640
friends I can't wait to give it again

1034
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,700
because it's just been a treat going

1035
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,619
through this data looking at what I can

1036
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:28,380
learn and so this is kind of

1037
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,060
this is the thing I've been thinking

1038
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,700
about is what if we took some of this

1039
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,619
and we brought it to the next level like

1040
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:38,339
I I truly plan to put together a if

1041
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:39,839
you're in the corporate world we have to

1042
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:40,920
do these things called tabletop

1043
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,040
exercises where you like pretend you

1044
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,540
basically Drew like Dungeons and Dragons

1045
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,400
style role-playing a security incident

1046
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,740
right what if instead of doing your

1047
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,540
tabletop against modern infrastructure

1048
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,820
you did your tabletop on the Starship

1049
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,660
Enterprise

1050
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,579
and you put together some sort of attack

1051
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:59,040
that was so ridiculous no one can

1052
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,320
nitpick because one of the complaints I

1053
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,180
always have is anyone who's ever done

1054
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,160
these tabletop exercises is you try to

1055
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,740
make a semi-realistic environment and

1056
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,960
there's always that well actually guy

1057
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,400
and you just want to punch him in the

1058
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,900
freaking face because it's like I know

1059
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,579
it's not exactly like this it's close

1060
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,440
enough just play the damn game so we can

1061
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,800
get done okay and and that's the thing I

1062
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,900
keep thinking about is I think we can

1063
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,420
make some of this fun if we take it and

1064
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,880
like even this talk I there are real

1065
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,920
security lessons in this that you can

1066
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,960
take away I mean I think the two-factor

1067
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,940
off is a big one it's easy to look at

1068
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,740
the ridiculous authentication on this

1069
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,660
ship and say like literally if they had

1070
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,880
a human key like this show would have

1071
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,000
sucked you know and that's okay that's

1072
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,160
cool I like them I like the fact that

1073
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,180
you can say like don't let your Android

1074
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,040
go and do anything alone you know

1075
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,839
there's so many things we can learn from

1076
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,760
this don't let the interns have like

1077
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,099
unfettered access to technology maybe I

1078
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:58,260
don't know I don't know so anyway all

1079
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,720
right this was

1080
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,960
that's it questions comments concerns

1081
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,820
all right I have one

1082
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,160
one question everyone asks am I going to

1083
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,880
do this with another Star Trek series no

1084
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,940
it was it was too much work I I no just

1085
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,300
no way

1086
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,000
there's I have news coming out about I'm

1087
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,680
not doing it but there's a Star Wars

1088
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,900
thing coming out uh uh the fourth the

1089
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,740
fourth of April they're being

1090
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,440
announcement I'll let you know what's

1091
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,540
that start again you know I only ever

1092
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,220
watched a Stargate movie I never really

1093
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,440
watched the show it I know I know it's

1094
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,940
supposed to be good I just haven't ever

1095
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,430
done it

1096
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,629
[Music]

1097
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,200
but

1098
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:49,219
[Music]

1099
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,099
yeah it was it's been a treat any other

1100
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:54,890
questions no

1101
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:58,200
[Music]

1102
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,540
no I did not and I thought about that

1103
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,040
and then I was like you know what I've

1104
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,079
been working on this long enough but I

1105
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,880
do think the movies are super

1106
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,440
interesting because they have like

1107
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,599
there's what they put like the hack into

1108
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,339
Georgie's visor in one of them which is

1109
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:13,920
great the one where the board go back in

1110
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,900
time to change you know to create their

1111
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,119
Paradox or whatever and and I agree the

1112
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:20,099
movies I think are even dumber in the

1113
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:22,740
show in many respects so I think they

1114
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,320
could be way more fun to tear apart but

1115
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,060
and and they just ah they do such dumb

1116
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,560
stuff in those movies anyway the whole

1117
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,000
show is like this but whatever whatever

1118
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,560
it doesn't matter it's all fake all

1119
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,119
right all right any other questions

1120
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,940
awesome well thank you all this has been

1121
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,839
an absolute truth

1122
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,119
right here
