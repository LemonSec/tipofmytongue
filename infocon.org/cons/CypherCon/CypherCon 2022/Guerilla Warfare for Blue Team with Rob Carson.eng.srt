thank you

3
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:29,238
[Music]

4
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,218
all right

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,460
foreign

6
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,099
Warfare for the blue team so to start

7
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,680
off how many of you have unlimited

8
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,180
budget and all the Staffing you need for

9
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,619
your security program

10
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,299
yeah there's always like one I had a

11
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,100
drink last night oh okay I just want to

12
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,540
make sure yeah and that is kind of the

13
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,580
point of this so neither did Al-Qaeda

14
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,040
neither did Dash neither did the Cubans

15
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,860
the Irish or our American forefathers

16
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,400
American revolutionaries same thing

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,780
underfunded understaffed we're still

18
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,180
able to create effects on Target and

19
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:30,960
that's what we're going to talk about

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,759
today

21
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:32,960
foreign

22
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,540
[Music]

23
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,860
something nobody understands what's

24
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,900
going on can't get the support you need

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,579
we're gonna talk about Communications

26
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,460
how to push out your i o campaign things

27
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,259
like that and there's a lot of memes so

28
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,380
if nothing else it'll be fun

29
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,340
um

30
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,360
one of the things though that uh

31
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,860
there's a challenge with this talk is

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,360
making sure that we say I try to say

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,500
vacantly accurate but I'm going to be

34
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,360
talking about Che Guevara I don't say

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,520
Tong all sorts of people some of these

36
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,659
are more Infamous they're not

37
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,000
necessarily All Good People however they

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,380
were able to create effects we're going

39
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,399
to talk about their tactics and

40
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,800
techniques not their uh politics if that

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,040
makes sense I want to get canceled

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,140
all right so what's my background why am

43
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,720
I to qualify to talk to you so

44
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,459
I was an infantry officer in the Marine

45
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:21,660
Corps

46
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,420
um so I did unilateral counterinsurgency

47
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,660
operations as an occupying power in Iraq

48
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,280
um I also live with the Iraqi Army for a

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,980
year uh as a host nation advisor and

50
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,540
that was uh incredible incredible

51
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,700
experience because I was able to see the

52
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,980
effects of people in process when they

53
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,300
didn't have the technology they didn't

54
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,340
have the American Muscle and they were

55
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,519
very very effective in dealing with

56
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,200
their own problems and they had good

57
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,720
messaging and they

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,500
um

59
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,080
did it with way less and that was very

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,819
impressive to me so I want to talk about

61
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,680
that and then obviously corporate

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,660
background so I've uh sat on the blue

63
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,220
team who's the head of security a couple

64
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,980
places now I uh help people do uh what I

65
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,300
call the Arts and Crafts cyber security

66
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,480
equipment and Security Programs ISO

67
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,280
stuff like that

68
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,360
um

69
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,760
yeah it's gonna be fun

70
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,800
all right

71
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,019
so what this talk is not about this is

72
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,840
not a talk about overthrowing your boss

73
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,850
all right

74
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,060
[Music]

75
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,080
changes in leadership will produce

76
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,540
undesired results

77
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,340
also if you take anything back from this

78
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,019
don't go back to your company and talk

79
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:28,920
about you're going to launch an

80
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,080
Insurgency campaign or you might wind up

81
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,120
starting your own company ask me how I

82
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,959
know

83
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,819
yeah

84
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,459
yeah uh

85
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,540
yeah all right so let's talk about a

86
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,099
background so how many people here are

87
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,540
veterans

88
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,760
okay a few people so for those of you

89
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,200
with the non-military background we do a

90
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,459
little bit of a primer on what Warfare

91
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,560
is so we kind of get a little bit of a

92
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,379
background it'll be great so first gen

93
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,860
Warfare right that's basically people

94
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,540
online with bows and arrows up the

95
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,640
muskets thing Revolutionary War the

96
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,040
British side second generation Warfare

97
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,780
same thing they're still online to fight

98
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,659
each other but now we've got uh rifles

99
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,180
right so World War One how the European

100
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,060
spot uh your third generation Warfare

101
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,939
think of that as like uh World War II

102
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,918
big maneuver elements things like that

103
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,600
it's also similar to probably your

104
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,940
networks in a pre-covered world where

105
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,139
you had your network you had big

106
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,000
firewalls in your safe space there was a

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,460
there was a perimeter you know but now

108
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,380
in a post-covered world we're now in

109
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,580
fourth generation Warfare which is

110
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,980
decentralized right

111
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,340
[Music]

112
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,259
um

113
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,360
yeah so we're talking decentralized

114
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,500
we're talking ideologically driven

115
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,639
that's what that's what fourth

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,840
generation Warfare is in the real world

117
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,639
but at the same time like there's no

118
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,139
safe space anymore everyone's working

119
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,360
all over the place and it's it's the

120
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,820
same kind of concept and then your fifth

121
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,960
generation Warfare which is still

122
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,500
debatable is essentially uh non-physical

123
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,740
more for uh less ideologically driven or

124
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,060
generally more of like a ransomware

125
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,860
stuff like that where you're just more

126
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,280
pirate pirate side of uh Warfare Google

127
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,660
all right

128
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,660
next thing three block war so this is

129
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,419
the term uh coined by General krulak so

130
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,759
the concept is essentially in three

131
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,040
contiguous city blocks you could be

132
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,199
handing out candy taking care of people

133
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,900
you move to your second block you're

134
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,000
doing patrols governance things like

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,800
that and then your third block could be

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,180
in kinetic action

137
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,039
it's not that different than a day of a

138
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,139
security person where you wake up in the

139
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,759
morning give some training to people

140
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,800
help them out you know working through

141
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,539
different problems doing a change

142
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,880
management meeting governance and then

143
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,259
you activate your incident response plan

144
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,479
at 4 pm on Friday because nobody ever

145
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,160
hacks you on Tuesday 9 A.M when you've

146
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,620
had your first cup of coffee like is my

147
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,120
experience

148
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,699
um but what's important about that is it

149
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,139
requires a different mindset right so

150
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,560
the way you act during those different

151
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,300
blocks is critically important to a good

152
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,580
Insurgency campaign you know so when

153
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,960
you're handing out candy you're being

154
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,759
patient with people like we used to hand

155
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,020
out etcha sketches when they got

156
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,580
infected so they had a tablet they were

157
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,160
secure for a minute you know like solve

158
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,419
a problem instead of like my analysts

159
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:07,560
screaming at them because like they let

160
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,880
their kids do homework on their laptop

161
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,580
and now we have ROBLOX

162
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,580
um yeah I'm not the only one that's had

163
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,100
that problem huh

164
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,780
you know so we want to make sure that we

165
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,820
have those Rules of Engagement as our

166
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,919
mindset right like how do we handle how

167
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,060
do we operate in those different

168
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,100
environments is a key piece to an

169
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,720
Insurgent campaign

170
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,860
um because essentially like if you

171
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,819
create

172
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,220
if it goes bad you start yelling at

173
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,280
people people stop talking to you right

174
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,199
um

175
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,060
yeah the best part does me are and

176
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,139
instant response that's when you can

177
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,699
tell people to shut up and color like

178
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,520
we've got stuff to do right

179
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,600
yeah

180
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,120
all right hybrid Warfare this is

181
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,280
essentially yeah you like I told you got

182
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,259
good names nothing else

183
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,600
um think of that as uh when Russia

184
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,720
invaded the Crimea in 2014 uh they were

185
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,639
sending out text messages to their to

186
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,919
the local population

187
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,960
um to to help with their effects that's

188
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,360
using technology and so the virtual and

189
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,880
the physical to create an effect same

190
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,979
thing as somebody sending in a Dell

191
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,080
laptop to your company or a Macbook

192
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,340
whatever it is they know that's what you

193
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,740
use it gets shipped in gets into your

194
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,300
inventory next thing you know you've

195
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,260
already created a

196
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,340
[Music]

197
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,259
we put a laptop on your environment you

198
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:23,699
have no idea what's your commanding

199
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,380
control issues and that's where things

200
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,300
like you look at hybrid warfare that's

201
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,160
where things like uh some of these

202
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,840
Frameworks ISO stock too those things

203
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,099
help because essentially if you're

204
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,259
looking at physical and virtual uh

205
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,639
issues and you're not just focused on

206
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,060
one thing

207
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,800
so the other thing about hybrid Warfare

208
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,440
uh that I look at is you know you can

209
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,639
push out all the fishing terrain you

210
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,319
want but like I would at least in a

211
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,940
pre-copic world I'd put posters up

212
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,940
rotate them around uh has anyone ever

213
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,560
thought about inviting their executive

214
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,699
team or some of their Business Leaders

215
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,259
to one of these hacker conferences you

216
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,240
ever thought about that yeah we bring

217
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,500
them here because then essentially like

218
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,639
they're starting to get the

219
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,020
understanding of what's going on for you

220
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,699
that's right it's putting in Beyond blue

221
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,340
team sucks like right you're underfunded

222
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,500
it's not sexy nobody's like yeah I want

223
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
to be a blue team when I grow up like no

224
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,419
like that's not a thing right so

225
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:13,740
bringing them there so they they can

226
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,060
kind of they get that understanding they

227
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,400
go oh crap right

228
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,780
and then of course you've got your trip

229
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,060
wires you know tracking dock flow honey

230
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,340
nuts honey traps things like that

231
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,520
all right any questions on background

232
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,060
all right

233
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,979
prerequisites so what do we got to have

234
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,020
to launch a good Insurgency campaign you

235
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,240
got to have an attractive cause so with

236
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,958
the sunnis uh in 2000 and

237
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,479
2007 we had what was called the Sunni

238
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,360
Awakening in Iraq where

239
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,040
we got the sunnis who were

240
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,360
disenfranchised we were able to work

241
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,160
with them created a cause where they

242
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,779
were able to take control of their own

243
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,240
areas and essentially have their patrols

244
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,279
they certain neighborhood watches things

245
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,480
like that they got control they were

246
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,920
disenfranchised they're already dealing

247
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,320
with a lot of Blue on Blue but with

248
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,519
fighting their own people things like

249
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,440
that so you want to have a cause that's

250
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,380
going to get people to care so what does

251
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,839
that mean for the corporate world right

252
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,760
well for running around going the

253
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,320
hackers are coming that's not going to

254
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,740
get any no one cares right so if your

255
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,540
cause is something about what the

256
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,160
business does what do other people care

257
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,260
about in the company it's not about you

258
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,240
it's about them right how do we protect

259
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,060
people's paychecks because like at the

260
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,959
end of the day you can buy your

261
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,399
employees LifeLock you can't buy them

262
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,480
new jobs

263
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,279
so what do we want to

264
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,100
um what's going to matter right and also

265
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,360
you want to cause this kind of generate

266
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,220
outside support that's another big piece

267
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,500
is you know what do your customers care

268
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,940
about they care about these things

269
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,040
leveraging that never let a good crisis

270
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,740
go to waste right uh your investors

271
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,360
things like that making sure you have a

272
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,100
cause that has internal support and

273
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,320
external support so you know if your

274
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,360
cause is to help protect this line of

275
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,100
business which also ensures that this

276
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,320
executive gets this bonus that's a good

277
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,720
cause right it's not about the money

278
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,880
it's all about the money so help them

279
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,899
you know that's what you got to think

280
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,160
about your mindset how you're talking to

281
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,320
people does it cause resonate with them

282
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,060
do they care about what you're talking

283
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,920
about

284
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,779
and Doctrine and mine said Can anyone

285
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,720
here tell me whose code of arms that is

286
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,800
or who said this quote

287
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,540
are you

288
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,120
excuse me uh anybody else all right so

289
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,519
that's Che Guevara all right so again

290
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,560
what you take from this talk is

291
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,540
important one thing that you don't want

292
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,640
to take is do not call your fellow

293
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,700
employees peasants

294
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,980
okay I won't go over a while

295
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,440
um but the point is is pretty valid

296
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,760
right so you want to work with your

297
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,260
employees right screaming at them

298
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,399
because they did something stupid they

299
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,839
clicked on something it's not going to

300
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,220
be a very effective process they're

301
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,779
going to stop talking to you they won't

302
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,640
tell you what's going on and the next

303
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,720
thing you know it could be worse right

304
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,240
so having that good communication with

305
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,560
your with your people taking care of

306
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,360
them helping them understand it like we

307
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,000
all clicked on stuff you know except for

308
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,100
this guy right here but the rest of us

309
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,740
you know uh We've clicked on stuff so

310
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,120
the thing about those Rules of

311
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,500
Engagement how do you how do you engage

312
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,240
with people you know one of the things

313
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,100
that we did is we put in a warrant

314
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,079
system so that I if the manager came to

315
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,160
me so I think my employees on Facebook

316
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,140
all day I don't care it's a management

317
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,000
problem unless there's a security issue

318
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,820
it's not my problem so it keeps my team

319
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,320
which is you know I got a small

320
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,779
Insurgency right or a small team

321
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,399
what are we focused on what matters

322
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,279
right and that way it stopped them it

323
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,600
stopped us from being big brother so

324
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,980
other employees were more interested in

325
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,600
working with us because they knew that

326
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,519
like hey we aren't just snooping around

327
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,079
on people's stuff but we don't care

328
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,640
unless there's a reason

329
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,540
who has time

330
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,640
um

331
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,860
yeah

332
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,040
all right

333
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,600
plan

334
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,240
communication playing matters

335
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,040
all right does anyone know these people

336
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,540
nice

337
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,880
impressive all right

338
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,200
um so

339
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,640
the difference between these two guys is

340
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,320
one of them had good Communications and

341
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,200
one of them is no longer in power so the

342
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,540
guy on the left Hussein Mubarak was a

343
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,880
prime minister of Egypt or president of

344
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,680
Egypt whatever it was

345
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,300
um he lost control of this

346
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,800
Communications through groups of

347
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,420
activists things like that they were

348
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,740
able to get Torah in there and they were

349
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,200
able to get their message out doing and

350
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,820
during the air spring of 2007 200 10. I

351
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,839
think

352
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,279
um in Tahir Square

353
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,560
right got their messages out and they

354
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,540
created an outside support for their

355
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,120
cause which put eyes on what was going

356
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,600
on in Cairo which stopped movard from

357
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,760
potentially doing waste you know using

358
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,260
options that would have shut down that

359
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,399
uh

360
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,880
uh protest in a way that would not be uh

361
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,959
optically pleasing if you will but

362
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,360
erdogan this guy shut down a coup with

363
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,860
FaceTime

364
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,139
right and the point is like having good

365
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,820
cons he created a cause that resonated

366
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,740
he created almost a modern day Tiananmen

367
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,139
Square he had tanks he there were the

368
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,459
coup that had tanks on the a major

369
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:14,220
bridge and on Bosphorus in Istanbul

370
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,500
and they had people on the bridge facing

371
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,899
it down he got his support out there out

372
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,000
into this out into the streets to stop

373
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,560
the coup

374
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
like that's

375
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,760
a cause that resonated right

376
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,680
um so the point is like having good

377
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,000
comps right

378
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,620
you know think about your IR response to

379
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,180
social media you know when you guys do

380
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,060
tabletop exercises or instant response

381
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,899
training how often do you bring

382
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,480
marketing into your IR training making

383
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,560
sure that they're part of it because

384
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,060
there are some of us who are not

385
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,740
qualified to talk to the public

386
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,320
blessed are I'm not I have somebody that

387
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,339
would handle that for me it's like

388
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,019
there's no way

389
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,339
um but that's an important thing right

390
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,079
is who's going to hand what's your

391
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,399
what's your communication going to be

392
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,720
like how do we handle that like I love

393
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,220
how United like you complain about

394
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,180
United

395
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,700
10 seconds later hey DM me let's take

396
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,839
this offline let's have a conversation

397
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,760
what's going on like that's exactly what

398
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,320
you know how do you how are you going to

399
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,899
engage with somebody in social media

400
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,519
and also like when you're talking to Dev

401
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,980
all right talk to them about their code

402
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,779
secure code they want to talk about that

403
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,060
because it resonates they do not want to

404
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,139
hear about you taking away their

405
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,600
MacBooks it's their precious

406
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,880
move on we have jamf now for that it'll

407
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,120
be fine

408
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,019
so gotta have a plan right

409
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:29,459
you know making sure you have economic

410
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:30,240
growth

411
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,700
cause it resonates using that

412
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,940
intelligence right so you know I used to

413
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,339
put people I would try to find

414
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:39,480
you know either people that like

415
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,279
security or just want that were friendly

416
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,320
in different lines of business in a

417
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,660
company and get them to help be part of

418
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,160
the solution giving us that Intel of

419
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,480
like hey this is what the organization's

420
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,860
doing or this is we're looking to get

421
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,360
into this new third parties whatever

422
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,279
we're doing so we can be part of the

423
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,540
solution but getting that intelligence

424
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,399
of what's going on inside the company

425
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,720
you know insurgents are going to put

426
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,920
people in all these different Villages

427
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,779
you can do the same thing there's

428
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,160
nothing to stop you right from

429
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,900
understanding that

430
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,139
[Music]

431
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,339
um

432
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,019
you know and also you think about like

433
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,279
uh

434
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,260
Your your long game right using your

435
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,000
resources strategically shutting off

436
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,680
Facebook on day one

437
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,060
probably not going to win a lot of

438
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,380
hearts and Minds

439
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,180
shutting off Myspace that'd be

440
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,040
interesting to see who complains like

441
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,320
that one I might do you know

442
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,320
like just to be like oh okay you're we

443
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,519
know who that is that might be a way to

444
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,260
get us to mental right

445
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,579
um and the other thing is asymmetric

446
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,740
communication so one of the things that

447
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,600
marketing people did in the 1950s is

448
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,760
they realized they needed to start doing

449
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,440
these like uh working groups where they

450
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,060
would basically get start Gathering more

451
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,040
and more information from people right

452
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,779
well

453
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,240
that's asymmetry would pull tons of

454
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,040
information from people how they think

455
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,660
what they like what they want to do and

456
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,120
then they turn around using eight so

457
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,980
straight quick zono asymmetric

458
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,839
communication means

459
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,100
okay good are you ready man are you

460
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,519
drinking water sorry uh so symmetric hi

461
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,440
Hi how are you I'm good

462
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,060
asymmetric

463
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,100
right now this is asymmetric I'm talking

464
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,420
to you

465
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,040
and we're talking to you

466
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,740
there you go so

467
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,120
and then they turn around and get them

468
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,500
to make those decisions same kind of

469
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,300
thing so when you're doing your training

470
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,040
having those discussions with people

471
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,320
like not maybe having Dev as a separate

472
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,000
security training so you're talking

473
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,680
about what death cares about you can

474
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,120
have a better conversation you're

475
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,860
Gathering that Intel on how they operate

476
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,959
what they care about so that you can

477
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,420
turn around and use your i o campaign to

478
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,680
create the effects that you desire

479
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,519
sorry I get upset

480
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,259
all right you know look at your

481
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,120
ecosystem right

482
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,980
what's your core business what are the

483
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,240
things that can affect those internal

484
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,100
and external threats how you look at

485
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,180
things

486
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,339
all right remember the cyber world

487
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:54,839
Warfare it's going to be limited right

488
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,820
you only have so many resources you need

489
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,800
to create those effects dominance is

490
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,360
difficult to achieve so you need to

491
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,339
think about where you're like what is

492
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:03,899
what does that ecosystem look like where

493
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,699
are you going to be most successful

494
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,419
why are you not

495
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,400
all right and then threat Intel

496
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,559
so one of the things I tell everybody is

497
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,000
draw two or there's always two org

498
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,380
charts in an organization there's the

499
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,179
official one and then there's the

500
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,859
unofficial one there's the The

501
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,480
Unofficial one is the one that tells you

502
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,939
hey this guy is friends he's been

503
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,799
friends with this guy for for life he

504
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,240
goes he goes to the CEO's birthday

505
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,340
parties but he's just a PM but he's

506
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,600
really not just PM because he's an

507
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,820
influencer or this VP brought in this

508
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,799
guy and these guys are boys from back in

509
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,480
the day over here that stuff happens

510
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,919
right every organization you've been to

511
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,679
or anytime the m a stuff happens we all

512
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,240
know how that goes right new leadership

513
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,960
all of a sudden extra people show up

514
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,080
um

515
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,880
and you need to because the other piece

516
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,460
is For Thread Intel like there's plenty

517
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,660
of companies here that'll sell you lots

518
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,679
of cool things

519
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,400
I'll be honest with you like uh you know

520
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,140
you can get a poor man threat fee with a

521
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,840
tweak deck and a uh I have a component

522
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,480
account let's start right just subscribe

523
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,039
to a few things you get some news you

524
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,080
can get some Intel that way but the

525
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,760
other thing to think about is when

526
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,020
you're trying to build that threat Intel

527
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,580
is the cost to uh for effects right so

528
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,960
if you know if you don't know the

529
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,220
identity of who's going to come after

530
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,100
you and you don't know what the risk is

531
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,240
you're going to spend a lot of money

532
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,280
cyber security industrial complex is

533
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,539
good I thought they will happily sell

534
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,480
you lots of things to do that

535
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,220
um but you spend a lot of money with a

536
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,780
fairly limited effect but if you know

537
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,340
the identity but it's not known risk

538
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,200
you're getting closer no one identity

539
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,480
known risk now you can definitely go

540
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,280
against it so building that intelligence

541
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,440
is an important piece and that can be

542
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,480
you know inside your organization too

543
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,460
right like who's against you who doesn't

544
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,660
want

545
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,400
biggest afraid of Big Brother watching

546
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,720
things like that what are the risks what

547
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,919
can they do how can they affect you

548
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,419
if you do nothing else I would copy this

549
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:00,179
down something I highly

550
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,760
hi everybody we built your intelligence

551
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,679
building out your key performance

552
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,679
indicators right so how are you going to

553
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,059
attractive see your processes are

554
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:09,960
working how do you gain that

555
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,580
intelligence that people are doing what

556
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,960
you think they are how do you measure

557
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,520
that and what are you going to do about

558
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,539
it

559
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,280
obviously Burt Reynolds rest in peace

560
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,460
it's not a security engineer anymore but

561
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,080
uh

562
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,880
that's one thing that I found pretty

563
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,160
useful here uh

564
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,780
[Music]

565
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,340
all right we're talking about four

566
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,460
minutes recipe again you know cheap way

567
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,080
there's all such good stuff out there

568
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,600
but that's a start

569
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,679
all right

570
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,720
let's talk about our assets right we

571
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,679
want to embed to people right

572
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,900
decentralized Workforce Social Security

573
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,720
got to decentralize it

574
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,640
get involvement understand their

575
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,559
processes training training is huge I

576
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,080
feel like I've got no before which I've

577
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,140
got a whole comment on that but uh

578
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,120
no more Force fishing training are you

579
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,200
going to train people on actually how to

580
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,520
follow your process

581
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,220
how how to get how to get software

582
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,559
approved how to do those things what

583
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,000
matters what do you care about things

584
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,960
like that

585
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,520
you know

586
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,900
um it's an important piece I think

587
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,700
misses out people just say they read the

588
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,100
policies but that's not

589
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,960
they read the politics making sure that

590
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,039
they can actually they know how to

591
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,600
follow the policies and they understand

592
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,700
what's going on they also can you know

593
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,780
look at the third parties if you say

594
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,460
like hey if you're handling this type of

595
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,260
data I'm looking for vendors that have

596
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,480
ISO stock 2 or something like that

597
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,039
if you're not handling this kind of data

598
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,440
I don't care it's marketing whatever

599
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,660
like username and passwords finally

600
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,240
giving them helping them understand one

601
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,500
they don't want to necessarily handle

602
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,240
all the cool data because if they do the

603
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,200
rules suck right

604
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:43,980
all right and remember one of the things

605
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,900
that's important is

606
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,539
uh support is conditional right so as

607
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,039
you're building your Insurgency you're

608
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,980
trying to get your populations on your

609
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,320
side for a while but if you spend four

610
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,419
weeks to approve notepad plus plus or

611
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,820
Adam for some developers they're going

612
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,440
to revolt you have lost their support

613
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,740
okay so you got to think about taking

614
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,299
care of the little things and that we're

615
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,520
going to talk a little bit more but

616
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,720
where can you start where can you

617
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,700
actually be effective not trying to boil

618
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,380
the ocean not trying to do all the

619
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,539
things like let's try to win where we

620
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,419
can you have limited resources

621
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:21,740
use them effectively

622
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,940
i o

623
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,700
start early Dev is more paranoid than we

624
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,600
are

625
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,100
they will create the fear of the unknown

626
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,500
they will create like they will think

627
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,360
that the acceptable use policy is you

628
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,740
know stop them from working they're not

629
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,940
going to do their job it's gonna be

630
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,260
terrible

631
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,820
and it turns out if you can be compliant

632
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,559
and do a thousand pushes a day in devops

633
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,720
it's totally doable but you have you

634
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,100
know you can't use ITIL change

635
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,120
management

636
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,860
fun fact change management doesn't mean

637
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,720
change meaning just

638
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,940
you know anytime you go back to your

639
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,500
shots there

640
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,120
um but you got to make sure that you're

641
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,460
using that propaganda because propaganda

642
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,880
is propaganda pushing it out to inform

643
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,460
people okay you can't use propaganda to

644
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,720
fool people that's what the bad guys can

645
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,880
do unfortunately you're the blue team so

646
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,179
you can't fool but you need to push that

647
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,340
stuff out now I've been guilty of

648
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,320
putting threatbud up when they we

649
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,960
thought there was a DDOS attack and I

650
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,400
thought that she reboot the firewall

651
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,900
told him hey I'm monitoring the heck out

652
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,340
of this right now like one of those

653
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,620
attack Maps it's funny

654
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,820
um but you gotta be vigilant against

655
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,100
misinformation right it's a critical

656
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,260
piece of your i o campaign

657
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,640
you know interpretation security

658
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,360
policies security policies is it's it's

659
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,460
phenomenal what you think you said or

660
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,740
wrote down and what was interpreted

661
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,600
so making sure you're Vigilant against

662
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,000
that I mean I had a guy the other day

663
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,440
he's like well I think you know if I put

664
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,820
on encryption my macbook's gonna slow

665
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,860
down I was like I'll hold your MacBook

666
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,840
he's like oh you're old it's like that

667
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,580
shit's already turned on bud

668
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,039
yeah so but you gotta you gotta make

669
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,299
sure you're you're ahead of that stuff

670
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:58,620
because that's how people think people

671
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,700
still think encryption is going to slow

672
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,940
them down they have chips way better now

673
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,280
um the other part is you know we think

674
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,900
about IO in the real world like remember

675
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,059
when Snowden came out first it was Booz

676
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,440
Allen Hamilton

677
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,480
a week later government contractor

678
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,980
government contractor wasn't Bruce

679
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,500
allenham was just government contractor

680
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,000
all of a sudden they were able to push

681
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,260
the message of just government

682
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,360
contractor it's not associated with a

683
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,940
specific company things like that think

684
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,980
about like when Airbus and uh when

685
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,480
Boeing has a problem Airbus has a

686
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,740
problem the other one's silent they

687
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,820
never sit there and go oh that's

688
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,820
terrible because that will affect uh

689
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,580
their uh

690
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,919
when something goes wrong with them

691
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,620
turn around's fair play also it could

692
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,280
create uh fear in the in the uh in the

693
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,780
public of

694
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,100
should we fly on planes are they safe

695
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,539
things like that like that's not a

696
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:50,580
productive discussion so like when

697
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,220
somebody gets hacked stuff happens well

698
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,260
it would never happen to me you know

699
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:59,760
yeah huh right well you know but for the

700
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,380
rest of us

701
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,400
um

702
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,380
you know do you have your own i o ready

703
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,780
for for instant response you know that's

704
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,980
why I always make sure like I have

705
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,659
marketing there like pre-canned scripts

706
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:11,280
like making sure employees are trained

707
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,900
this is how we answer the question when

708
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,640
customers call in hey it's under

709
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,620
investigation we'll let you know or if

710
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,000
they have something to say because if

711
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,140
you don't give them something to say

712
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,480
they will say stuff

713
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,039
they'll start offering their opinions

714
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,480
and you know you have some people in

715
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,799
your companies that would love to just

716
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,559
offer their opinion right

717
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,820
let's take truth power all day

718
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,600
all right

719
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,120
let's talk about execution

720
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,740
all right

721
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,960
so

722
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,780
where do we start first

723
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,580
for those of you who are too young this

724
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:49,020
is a copy of the office in the TV show

725
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,220
um yeah so like I said Isis the Marine

726
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,960
Corps we use you know disenfranchised

727
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,380
sunnis that was the place to start

728
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,179
um so where can you build those those

729
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,100
bases where can you get work done where

730
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,600
can you be effective you know not trying

731
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,760
to do everything at first right

732
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,140
um

733
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,120
but remember using a mutual cause lines

734
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,860
this can change just find something that

735
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,080
like everybody wants to win on you know

736
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,480
I was working with a customer and it was

737
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,059
a quite an adventure with them and

738
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,919
we start we start with a single sign-on

739
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,419
because they're ongoing onboarding

740
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,580
process was terrible they had tons of

741
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,559
user account issues so hey let's do

742
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,179
single sign on no new passwords and make

743
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,700
it everyone's a win-win right having

744
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,320
figuring out what you can start with is

745
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,900
going to be effective as opposed to hey

746
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,520
we're going to go roll out MDM and shut

747
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,080
off half the company's phones for three

748
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,820
days like that's probably not where I

749
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,179
want to start you know

750
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:43,260
because also like

751
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,960
stuff happens right

752
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,740
all right

753
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,640
drawn out execution

754
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,960
so

755
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,460
you're trying to build your program or

756
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,320
run your program continue to improve it

757
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,260
there's there's the uh Mal is all about

758
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,779
like the long walk right

759
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,880
um so one of some of the issues like

760
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,740
it's good to go slow sometimes right you

761
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,120
want to move at a medium pace but if you

762
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,919
go too slow you lose loss of will people

763
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,059
don't care

764
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:10,919
missed opportunities you know I never

765
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,539
really get crisis go to waste one-time

766
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:14,700
marketing tagged instead of taking you

767
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,740
to the article it took you to uh some

768
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,360
news feed sites third-part news feed

769
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,100
site it got corrupted took you to porn

770
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,860
so customer click on your website I took

771
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,539
them to porn marketing became in scope

772
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,880
of my security program

773
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,880
same day it's great

774
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,159
um also you get a call from Brian Krebs

775
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,299
I'm sure he's a great person I don't

776
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,679
want to get a call from you

777
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,659
like for those who don't know it's dying

778
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,100
story of infosec like you don't want to

779
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,100
talk to that guy it's not good

780
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,219
um

781
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,360
yeah so you're moving at a medium pace

782
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,220
right you know Confucius Gotta Have

783
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,140
Confucius quote it doesn't matter how

784
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,400
slow you go as long as you don't stop

785
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,539
right making those continual

786
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,460
improvements is a key piece and that's

787
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,779
one of the big things that I've seen in

788
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,700
Security Programs is like I feel like

789
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,320
moving slowly if you can make one

790
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,760
percent ten percent improvements every

791
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,480
week

792
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,299
boom you within you know a few months

793
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:04,740
all of a sudden you made 100 change in

794
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,059
your security program you're not going

795
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,039
to get it all done at once

796
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:09,480
I mean there's products out here that

797
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,159
I'm sure will tell you that they can but

798
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:12,600
you know

799
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,100
it's life right

800
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,200
like if you write a newsletter

801
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,460
don't do what I did and have your

802
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,779
monthly newsletter come out once every

803
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,700
six months maybe have like four

804
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,559
newsletters ready to go

805
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,179
so you can keep up with that

806
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:28,980
shortcut method so this is what Isis did

807
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,840
in Iraq

808
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,320
right so

809
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,659
uh after we after the military left Iraq

810
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,539
big boom it went it went hardcore into

811
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,039
Alabama right as soon as we're

812
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,440
disenfranchised same thing

813
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,820
well that's kind of like what you do

814
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,080
right before your audit trying to get

815
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,940
something done or after a brief those

816
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,020
are probably the only two times where it

817
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,640
works really well or you can get away

818
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,520
with it because like you break stuff but

819
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,880
it happens uh people will be more they

820
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,620
might work through it with you as

821
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,020
opposed to other times but otherwise

822
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,720
just trying to go all in can be quite a

823
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,039
challenge like rolling out your policies

824
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,020
things like that giving something to

825
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,520
them all at once they're not going to

826
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,260
absorb it all

827
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,440
it's all or nothing right

828
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,940
all right movement

829
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,919
so

830
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:18,900
we're back I love that one uh we're

831
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,220
moving out again we've got our campaign

832
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,419
going

833
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:23,700
moving through starting to be effective

834
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,440
now we gotta change our tactics

835
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,120
techniques and procedures we've got to

836
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,320
continue to change things up and

837
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,400
continue to think through how we're

838
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,260
going to solve the next problem not

839
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,820
relying on ourselves not relying on what

840
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,860
we already did but what what else can we

841
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,740
do you know what the Iraqis use or the

842
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,140
the insurgents in Iraq they used to put

843
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,059
out uh

844
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:45,000
garage door openers and you drove across

845
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,860
it IED would blow up blow up your

846
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,840
vehicle with the Marine Corps do I'm

847
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,460
sure the Army did too but I'm a marine

848
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,320
so we were there

849
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,000
um yeah uh they put a six foot metal arm

850
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,100
in front of the vehicle that was heated

851
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,600
up by spark plugs that would basically

852
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,760
set it off so the IED would go into the

853
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,679
engine block what are the insurgents do

854
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,900
okay they've got around that we're going

855
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,059
to use cell phones what do we do we

856
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,100
start jamming Communications I mean

857
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,559
everybody's Communications even ours but

858
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,860
they couldn't go off right that was you

859
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,299
know continue to shift stuff around

860
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,700
because like

861
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,380
the business that can continue to change

862
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,419
so will you right you need to make sure

863
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:25,620
you don't rest on your laurels continue

864
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,720
to evolve what made sense before it may

865
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,100
not make sense again your risk treatment

866
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,080
plan you got a big thing hey we're

867
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,940
putting in I don't know an email

868
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,039
security Gateway we need this and turns

869
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,419
out like that's not the biggest problem

870
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,159
we have now we need to do something else

871
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,960
you know ransomware is a bigger problem

872
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,940
or whatever it is

873
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,559
um

874
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,120
yeah

875
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,919
you know I like to change my pen testers

876
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,960
stuff like that looking at different

877
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,360
types of automation like continuous red

878
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,000
team and stuff like uh

879
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,600
this company called randori they do uh

880
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,799
continuous stretching so they actually

881
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,200
exploit they they take the

882
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,820
vulnerabilities and show what can

883
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,940
actually be exploited as opposed to just

884
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,940
getting you a CVSs score that's like

885
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,620
heavily weighted on availability which

886
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,000
may not be the big thing if you're not a

887
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,320
day trading platform or something like

888
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,419
that like so making sure you actually

889
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:16,919
know like what things are actually what

890
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:18,899
actually matters and sometimes these

891
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:19,860
vulnerabilities it's critical

892
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,779
vulnerability but it's so far into your

893
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,120
environment that

894
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,760
if they got to that they've already got

895
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,100
command and control like doesn't matter

896
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,380
right so making sure you're thinking

897
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,919
through those things

898
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,179
cessation

899
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:40,559
you know when you win

900
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,240
let's say you win something somebody has

901
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,100
to you know they tap down like okay fine

902
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,340
you can encrypt my laptop whatever it is

903
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,120
um

904
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,700
make peace right so if you look at what

905
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,260
was going on with the Taliban right

906
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,539
after we left Afghanistan they were

907
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:56,340
pushing out their their i o campaign was

908
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,679
hey we're not going to stop women from

909
00:30:58,679 --> 00:30:59,820
going to school we're going to do these

910
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,899
we're gonna do stuff right that's what

911
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:01,860
they were saying I was saying that's

912
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,000
what they did that's what they were

913
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,799
saying they were doing that to want to

914
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,120
keep the US from coming back in because

915
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,440
we were at that precipice where we could

916
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,820
hop right back in

917
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,100
well and they also want to they don't

918
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,020
want to create a new Insurgency with

919
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,240
people they just disenfranchise that are

920
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,220
no longer in power right so it's in

921
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,919
their best interest to make sure that

922
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,360
the population that they just became in

923
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,860
charge of doesn't turn on that

924
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,059

um

957
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:01,140
you know a limit he talked about a

958
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,700
limited War so achieving rapid effects

959
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,100
in a limited War right so focusing on

960
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,140
one thing knocking it out right not

961
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,880
trying to do everything

962
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,080
that's one of the things he talked about

963
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,059
he also talked about updating your plan

964
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,500
as you come to terms of the future so

965
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,299
understand future changes change your

966
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,220
plans if you look at how the Marines

967
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,440
came into World War one and why World

968
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,760
War One change when the Marine Corps got

969
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,779
there I'm sure there were other people

970
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:23,519
but it's because we started doing

971
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,440
maneuver Warfare while everyone else was

972
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,700
stolen trenches they tried to put us in

973
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,000
trenches and we said no

974
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,820
[Music]

975
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,059
um next guy Mount got that one all right

976
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,340
Mosaic War so a bunch of little

977
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,019
different things going on talked about

978
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,399
that each battle may be different so

979
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,519
understand what you do it's Gonna Change

980
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,100
okay you got the beret

981
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,980
not Jay the other one that's uh Roger

982
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,059
trancier

983
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:51,480
okay uh French dude fought in Algeria

984
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,179
there's a movie about stuff he was all

985
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:56,820
big into uh his idea of uh interrogation

986
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,080
was he was fine with slapping people

987
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,580
around they gave him the information to

988
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,899
give him a cigarette say okay have a

989
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:01,980
good day

990
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,899
um I don't recommend that controversial

991
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:06,240
guy however he was very effective and

992
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,860
one of the things he talked about was

993
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,199
making sure that uh and you complain

994
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,159
about the French army they were

995
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,560
preparing for World War II while they

996
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,739
were losing in Indochina and losing in

997
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,418
Algeria because they were still trying

998
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:21,540
to fight a World War II Type battle in a

999
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,639
different place that's why like when I

1000
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,080
see these big firewalls and all this

1001
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,359
stuff that's great but hey perimeters

1002
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,000
dead on with the new perimeter all right

1003
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,040
all right so we got tranquier

1004
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:42,639
[Music]

1005
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,699
uh he says avoid a single long operation

1006
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:50,159
right so play the long game but fight

1007
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,440
confusion plan for loss of command and

1008
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,119
control so when you're instant response

1009
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:56,699
stuff kill internet or kill kill email

1010
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:59,700
kill single sign-on turns out L that's

1011
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,020
single sign that's great except for hey

1012
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,820
we can't get to the HR stuff so we can't

1013
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,440
contact our employees but we can't log

1014
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,460
in

1015
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,920
oh crap maybe single sign is not great

1016
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,420
for everything

1017
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,619
um

1018
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:13,980
but you know make sure you you plan for

1019
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,839
that what you're out of band comes you

1020
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,220
know but fighting that confusion he was

1021
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,480
big on that

1022
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,880
Che we already talked about Shay earlier

1023
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,180
but uh

1024
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,440
one of the things he talked about was

1025
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,460
that every Every Act you know every uh

1026
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,200
everything you do should be followed

1027
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,180
along with the propaganda campaign so

1028
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,400
when you're rolling stuff out you need

1029
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,660
to roll stuff out with the

1030
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,119
communications around it hey we're

1031
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,440
making you do multi-factor

1032
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,320
authentication here's why

1033
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,099
not just shut up and color here's why

1034
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:49,619
like I'm married to a physician she's a

1035
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:51,240
wonderful woman but she was very pissed

1036
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,200
off the other day because they're like

1037
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,180
well now I can't log into Citrix on my

1038
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,200
personal computer I can only do it on

1039
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,140
this other computer you know smart

1040
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,880
person but she's

1041
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,099
she's a user right what is your

1042
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,720
propaganda campaign it's the part we

1043
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,040
spend the least amount of time on that's

1044
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,020
why security is such a bad name because

1045
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,040
like they sit there and think they're

1046
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,140
gonna lock you down and nobody knows why

1047
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,339
even these things are getting put in

1048
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:13,079
place they're just being told to do it

1049
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,240
and we gotta gotta push that propaganda

1050
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,760
campaign out there and I said to inform

1051
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,240
not to fool them to inform

1052
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,000
and then uh

1053
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,280
I'll see here oops

1054
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,140
sorry about trying he also wants

1055
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,820
population on your side is important and

1056
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,060
then margella so sorry about Che so the

1057
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,280
other guy is margellus Brazilian counter

1058
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,960
insurgents are uh actually not counter

1059
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,720
Insurgency uh girl Warfare guy

1060
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,520
fascinating dude

1061
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,339
um he was all about uh essentially a

1062
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:45,780
girl Warfare used to be a renaissance

1063
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,800
man so if you're familiar with

1064
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,599
Machiavelli he wants to be able to have

1065
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,400
a sword fight and sing a song at the

1066
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,980
same time like you need to be able to do

1067
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,359
a lot of different things

1068
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:55,980
same kind of thing that's what a

1069
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,240
renaissance man is that's the same thing

1070
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,700
as what Margaret wants a security person

1071
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,619
to be I'll be honest I know enough about

1072
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,060
a cryptography to call somebody better

1073
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,900
at cryptography than me but uh same time

1074
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,940
making sure we know enough about what's

1075
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,760
going on right and if you're from the

1076
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,980
90s and you don't understand you know

1077
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,260
the ephemeral and kubernetes and

1078
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,300
containers and you're trying to put AV

1079
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,579
on uh you know micro service or

1080
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:21,420
something that doesn't make any damn

1081
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,940
sense like

1082
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,380
update yourself right

1083
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,160
all right

1084
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:34,500
current events

1085
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,060
let's talk about Russia

1086
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,500
all right let's worry about this talk is

1087
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,760
that every six months I can get this

1088
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,380
talk every six months and there's some

1089
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,359
new stuff right

1090
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:44,339
so let's talk about information right

1091
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:46,320
how the i o campaign is working so

1092
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,060
Russia they banned all the media sign a

1093
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,960
message

1094
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,760
but that message only and their message

1095
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,320
only generates internal support it's not

1096
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,460
really creating support on the outside

1097
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,339
world ukrainians they did nationalize

1098
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:58,740
their media so fun fact however they

1099
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,619
still allowed you know all the uh other

1100
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:04,920
reporters still inside the country right

1101
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,020
that generates external support I mean

1102
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,300
look at their i o campaign I mean the

1103
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,180
president spoke at the Oscars

1104
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,300
like since when have we had you didn't

1105
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,040
even know where Ukraine was after doing

1106
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,900
this room probably wouldn't until

1107
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,839
recently I was there in November by the

1108
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:22,740
way

1109

um a Marriott guy but Hilton it came

1110
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:27,000
with a gas mask next to the minibar

1111
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,920
like Mary I really missed up their game

1112
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,440
just throwing that out there

1113
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,260

1114
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:37,040
all right what questions we got

1115
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,579
