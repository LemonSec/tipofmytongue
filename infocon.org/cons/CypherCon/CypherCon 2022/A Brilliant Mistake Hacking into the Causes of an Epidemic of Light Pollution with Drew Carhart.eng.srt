[Music]

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,700
thank you

3
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:29,238
[Music]

4
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,218
all right

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,460
foreign

6
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,320
I prefer to talk about more as a

7
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,040
nighttime conservation but uh

8
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,680
um so in in

9
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,020
basic overview of this topic a lot of

10
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,360
you have probably seen Graphics that

11
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,580
look like this this is a this isn't a

12
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,880
photo of the United States it's a

13
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,939
rendering of what uh modeling actually

14
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,880
of what the man-made light shining out

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,159
into the environment is like at night

16
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,119
this is from 1994 the data used for this

17
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,479
is from weather satellites and this is

18
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,040
the for these are the first years where

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,079
we had Digital Data like this from the

20
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,579
Department of Defense and their weather

21
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,939
satellites we can take models like this

22
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,979
we don't don't have that Digital Data to

23
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,020
see what the skies and the nighttime

24
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,700
conditions were like from years before

25
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,840
this but we can look at actual readings

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,520
that were made of the brightness of sky

27
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,500
in various places at various times and

28
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,000
we can regress this

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,940
I'm going to take it back 30 years from

30
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,940
this 1994 date to uh 1964 and this is

31
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,599
approximately what the nighttime Skies

32
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,080
would have looked like 30 years prior so

33
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,300
what we're seeing here is a real change

34
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,040
is it a little thing you have to stare

35
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,239
at it much to CEO there's a little

36
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,560
change in there this is like an

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,080
explosion that happened in outdoor

38
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,120
lighting during that period and what

39
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,400
caused it oh I should preface this by

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,900
saying I've been looking at this issue

41
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,800
since almost then I grew up in these

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,080
years and I watched this guy go away

43
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,780
I've been looking at this seriously as a

44
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,080
cause as a effort to do something about

45
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,000
it for like 15 years or so now so you're

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
going to be hearing my take on these

47
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,440
things what caused this is really very

48
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,060
simple it's a change in technology

49
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,959
pretty much we went from the 1950s and

50
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,599
60s being lit by dimmer mercury vapor

51
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,160
lights and even still incandescent

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,900
lights outdoors and even fluorescent

53
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,280
lights in some places

54
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,940
to the more ubiquitous yellowish sodium

55
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,640
highest pressure sodium street lights

56
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,200
they're much brighter they make more

57
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,540
light for the amount of electricity they

58
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,360
consume so instead of keeping the light

59
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,959
levels the same as they were in the 60s

60
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,480
and using less energy with these more

61
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,760
efficient lights we just made everything

62
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,220
a lot brighter so of course there's also

63
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,780
new street lights added in this period

64
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,280
too because you very rarely take out

65
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,500
three lights you just put in new ones

66
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,840
so why does this matter at all

67
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,860
um this is the main thing I want to

68
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,019
touch on today before challenge you all

69
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,700
to do something about it

70
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,420
um

71
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,200
we can break down five major issues of

72
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,640
things that are affected by this

73
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,620
artificial light out in the environment

74
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,019
at night and I'm going to put these in

75
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,940
no particular order because the priority

76
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,220
would depend on who you are but your

77
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,599
priorities are what your community's

78
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,299
priorities are we'll start out with

79
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:07,920
energy waste because that's a simple one

80
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,720
and we can break that down into

81
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,640
questions like

82
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,560
are we putting the right amount of

83
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,939
lighting out there if we're putting out

84
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,260
twice as much light as we need we're

85
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,000
using twice as much energy as we need

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,820
that simple physics if you're using if

87
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,440
we're making it eight percent brighter

88
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,880
than it needs to be we're using eight

89
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,979
percent more energy so again pretty

90
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,040
simple physics next question is

91
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,720
are we winning the whites when we don't

92
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,540
really need them do we turn on the

93
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,820
lights over a parking lot or over a road

94
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,900
or whatever

95
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,580
when there's traffic there and there's

96
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,259
activity there or do we have them go on

97
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,880
when the sunsets and turn off in the

98
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,160
morning when the sun comes back up

99
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,860
we can ask are we only lighting what

100
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,040
areas need to be lit

101
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,139
if we need to light up this parking lot

102
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,240
are we also lighting up the properties

103
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,800
on either side of them and down the

104
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,419
street and things like that too that

105
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:00,000
aren't our Target area that needs to be

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,020
lit

107
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,960
and the top of the list for energy waste

108
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,120
and Outdoor Lighting is the efficiency

109
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,280
of fixtures so let's look at that

110
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,740
kind of really quickly here here's a

111
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,300
light fixture you can buy today here's a

112
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,759
street light you can buy today

113
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,400
um it looks like a street light I mean

114
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,919
it's you plug it in and it goes on so it

115
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,600
it's an appliance it uses electricity

116
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,180
and reuse to the idea of our energy

117
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,160
consuming devices

118
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,860
these days being rated for how efficient

119
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,840
they are we see these yellow stickers

120
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,039
everywhere whether you buy a computer

121
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,139
printer or a washing machine you buy

122
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,820
your car it's got that stick around it

123
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,560
says how many miles per gallon it should

124
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,419
get how much it'll cost you to run it

125
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,160
for a year things like that

126
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,100
for outdoor lighting the efficiency

127
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,960
rating system looks like

128
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,759
oh there is no efficiency rating for

129
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,919
outdoor lighting I'm sorry I was leading

130
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,900
you down a path there so there is no

131
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,580
efficiency reading

132
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,039
um we can figure it out here's the cut

133
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,740
sheet on that light you'll notice from

134
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,660
the manufacturer's catalog there's no

135
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,100
yellow sticker on there that talks about

136
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,800
Energy Efficiency there is on the other

137
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,979
hand a big data set that the

138
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,780
manufacturer provides

139
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,180
that has the photometric data for this

140
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,220
light fixture and they have to provide

141
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,780
that for the lighting designers who need

142
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,240
to be able to calculate how many light

143
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,120
poles to put in and what spacing with

144
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,280
what modded lamps in them to provide the

145
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,660
illumination they need but we can take

146
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,660
that data and put it into other software

147
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,860
which gives us a view that looks

148
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,539
something like this

149
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:32,940
the colored disc there is actually a

150
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,860
sphere it's the severe light coming off

151
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,620
of the street light and it's divided up

152
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,620
into zones so down in the lower left

153
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,960
is this green quadrant

154
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,880
that's the light that's heading toward

155
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,160
the street that this pole is next to so

156
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,020
it's hitting down and out and across the

157
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,039
street

158
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,720
and then the table on the right hand

159
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,240
side of that indicates to us the amount

160
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,880
of the light that the lamp inside that

161
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,340
fixture is creating that goes into that

162
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,440
area so it's telling us in this case

163
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,080
that little less a quarter of the light

164
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,580
that the lamp makes is going down into

165
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,740
that green zone to light up the street

166
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,080
behind there's the yellow moderate it's

167
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,460
got a little light blue at the bottom of

168
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,680
it that's the light going into the yard

169
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,039
of the house along that street away from

170
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,560
the street there and the little like

171
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,300
loose spot the bottom is what's

172
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,740
theoretically shining down on the

173
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,259
sidewalks of that street so where the

174
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:26,639
pedestrians might be so that could be

175
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,160
useful light but we see in that backward

176
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,960
Zone there that almost supported the

177
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,759
light from the lamp is going there

178
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,680
then there's this dark blue band across

179
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,940
the middle which is

180
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,220
really inaccurately small this is the

181
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,599
lighting Industries

182
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,199
um

183
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,539
breakdown of directionality of light

184
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,639
that's their glarezone the glarezone

185
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,460
should really extend downwards much

186
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,979
farther down right laser is almost

187
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:51,840
burned out here

188
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,580
it should be much deeper than that

189
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,259
because light that shines out horizontal

190
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:56,940
down the block there's really nothing to

191
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,919
illuminate the street it's really only

192
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,380
effective down at lower angles but in

193
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,440
any case they still admit that 11 of the

194
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,880
like from the lamp is going into the

195
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,319
glare Zone

196
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,139
and then we have the topper the entire

197
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,240
upper red hemisphere

198
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,300
which is light which is 100 wasted so

199
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,940
that energy is 100 wasted and it's going

200
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,259
into the sky it's lighting up the

201
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,819
bottoms of birds and airplanes and

202
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,039
clouds and things and that serves no

203
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,800
public good and for this fixture half

204
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,220
the white 49.9 of the light from the

205
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,060
lamp

206
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,919
is going upward and directly being

207
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,599
erased it so talking about Energy

208
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,520
Efficiency again

209
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,099
how would you rate this map which you

210
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,080
can buy today it's it's horrible and it

211
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,219
doesn't matter

212
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,320
what the light bulb is inside of that

213
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,339
lamp

214
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:45,060
um

215
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,040
half of the energy being wasted is half

216
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,680
of the energy being wasted and what does

217
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,600
that mean well somebody's paying for the

218
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,100
energy first off if that's what matters

219
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,600
to you if it's Street lighting it's

220
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,760
probably taxpayers paying for it if it's

221
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,580
uh anybody paying for it there's an

222
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,620
environmental cost wasting electricity

223
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,080
too from whatever method is used to

224
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,720
generate electricity so

225
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,459
the conclusion here is in the yellow

226
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:09,480
there

227
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,399
today it isn't delightful we're so used

228
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,320
to indoors worrying about whether we've

229
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,000
got the newest Light Bulb that's being

230
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,240
the most efficient outside efficiency

231
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,800
isn't determined by the light bulb it's

232
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,019
determined by how good the fixture is at

233
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,760
putting the light it makes down where

234
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,260
it's needed

235
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,839
so we'll go on to Safety and Security we

236
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,540
have we put up lights to be able to be

237
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,040
active at night and we want to be safe

238
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,200
and we want to be secure while we're

239
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,120
doing our nighttime activities well

240
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,240
here's a street light it must make

241
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,040
it must make that screen safer because

242
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,320
it's a light and it's a street light you

243
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,180
know it's kind of glary though it's kind

244
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,220
of like these lights shiny at me if you

245
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,839
hold your hand up

246
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,300
to block the glare maybe you can see a

247
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,740
little bit more and oh

248
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,120
you might notice that there's actually

249
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,500
somebody standing under the street light

250
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,480
that you couldn't see without holding

251
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,800
your hand up to block the glare from the

252
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,060
street light because it's so poorly

253
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,600
designed so uh this is just one

254
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,000
example but believe me it's really true

255
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,380
that

256
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,420
good lighting can help us at night it

257
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,060
can enable us to be more active it can

258
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,040
make us safer and more secure

259
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,779
but bad lighting can do just the

260
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,279
opposite it can actually make it worse

261
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,320
for our visual process to see what we're

262
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,620
doing so uh this second consideration

263
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,899
with where lighting comes from

264
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,420
environmental disruption I think I would

265
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,740
probably put at the top of the list for

266
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,839
myself personally now now that I've been

267
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,120
studying this for quite a few years

268
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,019
um

269
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,200
to really quickly get the concept across

270
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,459
I think most people would understand

271
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:39,899
that if you took

272
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,019
a nice natural Meadow and you turned it

273
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,940
into a shopping mall

274
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,339
you'd be doing a lot of environmental

275
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,800
disruption there you're taking

276
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,200
this natural situation and you're

277
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,000
totally upending it

278
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,680
what we don't tend to think as much

279
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,600
about the fact that if you take an area

280
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,060
that has a natural cycle of Darkness at

281
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,120
night a light in the daytime and you

282
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,500
make it light in the daytime and

283
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,959
Perpetual Twilight all night long

284
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,180
you're also creating a tremendous amount

285
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,700
of environmental disruption and we are

286
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,940
very daytime oriented as human beings

287
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,700
and we if it's not daytime out we turn

288
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,320
out a bunch of Lights to make it so it's

289
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,760
a kind of like daytime out that's our

290
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,060
instinct to do that and uh what we we

291
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,120
have to remember is that

292
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,339
um that's not true for the rest of the

293
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,100
living things on the planet I have a lot

294
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,399
of papers that were research has done to

295
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,980
look for the effects of man-made white

296
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,160
in ecosystems and on organisms and I

297
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,779
will say out of hundreds of studies that

298
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:43,800
I have

299
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,079
um that I have read

300
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,360
I had called a single one they found no

301
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,500
impact from man-made light out in

302
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,000
ecosystems and on organisms usually it's

303
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
the other way around the uh impacts are

304
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,579
quite notable they're quite substantial

305
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:03,420
so uh the thing to remember again is for

306
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,519
billions of years and the millions of

307
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,380
years that all the things that are

308
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,060
living today on the planet have evolved

309
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,779
over

310
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,360
there was night with nothing more than

311
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,579
Starlight and periodic Moonlight and

312
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,740
light sunlight during the daytime and

313
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,300
that was the cycle of things and it's

314
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,380
just in the last blink of an eye

315
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,700
geological history wise we've been

316
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,500
upending that by making it light all

317
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,940
night long

318
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,459
but on health concerns we're animals too

319
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:33,180
uh Does having too much light at night

320
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,320
affect us

321
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,660
I I usually tell people that I think if

322
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,120
you studied human physiology

323
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,800
30 years ago

324
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,519
um

325
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,500
it was 40 years ago your textbook

326
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,000
probably wouldn't have say much at all

327
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,040
about

328
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,839
photosensitivity in human beings it

329
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,959
wasn't really a two notably study Topic

330
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,680
in the last 20 years there's been a lot

331
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,399
of research which has uh upended that

332
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,920
and shown demonstrated how

333
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,800
very photosensitive we are and

334
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,260
that too much exposure to light at night

335
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,399
could be very upsetting to our

336
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,260
physiology and uh

337
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,160
I think we're really just at the door

338
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,320
opening stage of understanding that and

339
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,880
there's a lot of research going on to

340
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,980
try to quantify how much we're talking

341
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,560
about so there's potentially concerns

342
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,360
about our own health too I'm going to

343
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,760
put

344
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,860
as I say we're more light sensitive than

345
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,899
we used to think or that maybe we want

346
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,820
to think we don't want to think that

347
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,680
turning our lights at night could be

348
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,079
possibly bothering our health but maybe

349
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,720
we should start thinking about that some

350
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,180
I've got is number five the last on list

351
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,360
is dark skies and that may be at the top

352
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,800
of your list it may not be on your list

353
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,180
at all if you live in an urban area

354
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,160
don't really think about it those people

355
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,500
would think that this really only

356
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,899
matters to professional astronomers who

357
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,220
are trying to study the universe and

358
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,620
over having basically the window blinds

359
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,500
drawn over the view of the universe by

360
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,300
the ever increasing light pollution on

361
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,680
the earth it keeps us from being on the

362
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,920
sea the entire rest of everything

363
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,220
but I would pose this as just a

364
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,899
something to think about

365
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,120
as far as

366
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,339
keeping the skies dark and being able to

367
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,700
see the stars I'd ask what if Galileo

368
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,320
had never seen the stars in the sky or

369
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,959
what if Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein

370
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,180
had never seen the stars in the sky or

371
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,880
the people who put us on the moon

372
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,800
again what if they had never seen the

373
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,740
Stars what if Shakespeare had never seen

374
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,079
the stars or Van Gogh had ever seen the

375
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,360
stars in the sky well this is the state

376
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,779
we're at now actually there's 80 percent

377
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,160
of the people on the planet live in

378
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,839
places where they really can't see the

379
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,699
stars of the sky at night so we're

380
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,560
taking this away from our society and we

381
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,699
know that

382
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,339
since time immemorial for the whole

383
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,459
history of our species the sky has been

384
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:02,100
this window to something Beyond

385
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,620
ourselves and uh

386
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,959
now it's if you walk outside in

387
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:07,920
Milwaukee

388
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,839
at night tonight go if the clouds are

389
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,180
gone you'd look up and you'd see three

390
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,420
or four stars and that view is gone that

391
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,820
that window isn't isn't open anymore and

392
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,620
I think that that's actually something

393
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,779
to be concerned about

394
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,459
so no one can see the stars anymore

395
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,160
that's that's an issue so we have these

396
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
five main

397
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,139
problems then the question is again what

398
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,779
are we doing wrong that's causing these

399
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,600
problems well we can go back to this

400
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,839
image of that really badly designed

401
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,699
light picture that's for some reason

402
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:42,839
whether you're sending half of its

403
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,880
outputs right up into the sky and

404
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,639
wasting another quarter of it in places

405
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,160
where it doesn't belong

406
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,120
um

407
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,339
that's really straightforward we should

408
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:54,660
be able to think of when we put up a

409
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,320
light

410
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,240
there's some some activity that we're

411
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,560
doing that we're trying to provide light

412
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,880
for and lightly goes anywhere else is

413
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,240
either wasted or and or problematic for

414
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,360
some reason or another because where it

415
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,860
goes where it doesn't belong life

416
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,540
becomes pollution instead of being a

417
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,519
useful thing

418
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,820
so this is one factor

419
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,920
about where light pollution comes from

420
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,800
it's not the only one thinking it is the

421
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,600
only one leads to

422
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,300
the creation of this illustration which

423
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,160
probably some of you have seen because

424
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,680
it gets published around the place I've

425
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,779
really come to hate this illustration

426
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,720
a lot and it's because

427
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,000
it oversimplifies the issue

428
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,339
I made my own version of it for a talk a

429
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:44,040
couple years ago and it looks like this

430
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,079
he takes all those first four things in

431
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,579
the top illustration and says these are

432
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:48,480
all bad

433
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,880
and the reason they're bad is because

434
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,560
there's a white light bulb in the layout

435
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,060
and uh you uh can't address light

436
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,519
pollution in any serious manner without

437
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,680
talking about the color of the like the

438
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,540
spectral quality of the light that we're

439
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,740
talking about dumping into the

440
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,760
environment it's like talking about

441
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,740
water pollution is what are you dumping

442
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,660
into there the top one

443
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,480
is that of the uh

444
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,240
high pressure sodium white which is

445
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,040
primarily just yellow light it's got a

446
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,480
little green a little blue or a little

447
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,000
red in it there but it's primarily that

448
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,619
bright yellow lines

449
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,400
the bottom four are white LEDs like the

450
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,919
kind you'll find commonly in outdoor

451
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,299
lighting now what you have there is a

452
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,040
lot more short wave light coming out a

453
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,559
lot more green and then into the blue

454
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:36,480
especially coming out in those LED

455
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,039
lights that's what makes them appear

456
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,240
more white to the eye because they have

457
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,980
a more bill on Spectrum

458
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,280
what's the trouble with blue light

459
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,340
well it was a photoreceptive chemical

460
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,600
called melanopsin and it's we have it in

461
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,860
the retinas of our eyes it doesn't

462
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,620
contribute to our visual system but it

463
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,380
tells it's connected to the very

464
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,120
primitive the reptile part of our brain

465
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,100
and it tells our brain

466
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,679
whether it's day or night and our brain

467
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,700
can the the has triggers the uh

468
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,559
formation of melatonin which you've

469
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,440
heard of which signals tells the whole

470
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,059
rest of the body it sends that nested

471
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,919
around it's nighttime you should be

472
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,340
resting uh if you go into breast mode

473
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,720
sleep mode

474
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,140
so this isn't just a human thing uh

475
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,500
melanopsin was discovered in frog skin

476
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,539
was found in the human eye frogs can

477
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:31,919
tell whether it's day or night through

478
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,039
their skin their skin is light sensitive

479
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:37,140
it's been found in algae

480
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,919
it's been found all across

481
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,840
several kingdoms of living things it's

482
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,900
an incredibly archaic very very uh

483
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,299
ancient

484
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:51,480
photoreceptive chemical and it's only

485
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,880
sensitive to Blue Light and that kind of

486
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,980
makes sense from an evolutionary sense

487
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,020
um it's blew out when it's daytime even

488
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,240
if it's cloudy the sky is blue basically

489
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,340
in the shade you're still getting more

490
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,780
blue light so it's a great thing to use

491
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,520
for a trigger of whether it's day or

492
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,679
night you could use that for our photo

493
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,360
self you know putting out to see whether

494
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,100
it's day or night but why don't you just

495
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,840
stick with blue and that that helps so

496
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,720
that's an issue there blue light is

497
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,880
biologically extremely active here's

498
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,260
Rayleigh scattering this is what makes

499
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,200
the sky blue when you shine red light up

500
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,880
up and through the sky it'll just keep

501
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,559
on going when you shine blue light it

502
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,780
scatters so we shine enough blue light

503
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,360
at night up in the sky it wants to turn

504
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,039
the sky blue like it is in the daytime

505
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,679
the glow spreads out the light scatters

506
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,200
so if we're shining up more blue light

507
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,700
in the sky

508
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,620
we're going to get much more sky glow

509
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,600
than we do with shiny longer wavelengths

510
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,679
up into the sky

511
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,320
here I also tossed in as another item

512
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,760
here at glare response the human eye

513
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,620
glare response is heavily blue sensitive

514
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,100
so you might notice by some headlights

515
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,120
make you win more than other ones do and

516
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,559
it's generally because the wider ones

517
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,360
have a lot more blue in them so they

518
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,000
trigger that both the discomfort and the

519
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,880
disability glare issues with the eye to

520
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,179
have more blue and the light

521
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,940
um here's this in practice there's a

522
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,179
county in Washington state that was

523
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,179
going to do a county-wide refit of their

524
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:20,039
street lighting so most of these Street

525
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,080
lighting that we had was there was

526
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,660
anywhere from 10 20 30 40 even 50 years

527
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,660
old most of it was high pressure sodium

528
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,179
a lot of it was in Old fixtures which

529
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:31,860
wouldn't be considered dark sky friendly

530
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,299
they have the hanging Globes and things

531
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,679
like that

532
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,419
the new fixtures which they're going to

533
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,900
do a county-wide switch out again

534
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,419
by LEDs they're in dark sky friendly

535
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,000
fixtures that only shine downward so you

536
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,320
would think that

537
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,980
when these folks did this study to

538
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,780
measure the actual sky brightness over

539
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,120
the county before and after the switch

540
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,100
out they would have found a notable

541
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,240
Improvement

542
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,460
and they found a notable degradation in

543
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,340
the uh bottom illustration here showing

544
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,340
the this is a skywide panorama of the

545
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,440
relative intensity of the sky glow over

546
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,020
these this County area and the bottom

547
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,840
one you can just visually see that the

548
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,299
explosion there of Skyward glow is

549
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,460
notably larger than the tablet that's

550
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,520
after the switch out so the switching to

551
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,380
better fixtures that shouldn't lie

552
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,780
downward didn't make up for the also

553
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,059
switching to White Light which bounces

554
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,039
off the ground and shines up in the sky

555
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,020
and creates tremendous English

556
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,179
tremendous and more sky glow

557
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:39,179
so that's that in practice

558
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,919
um let's talk briefly about U.S lighting

559
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,900
stairs and I can be really brief because

560
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,580
there there are no U.S lightning

561
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,620
standards for outdoor lighting

562
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,159
um

563
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,659
there are these things called

564
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,940
recommended practices which you will see

565
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,380
reference to any of you have worked in

566
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,600
lighting of any sort or even

567
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,640
peripherally read about it

568
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,460
will have or will if you do we'll run

569
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,500
into the RPS or recommended practices

570
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,740
that are developed by the IES which is a

571
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,659
trade group of lighting engineering

572
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,240
trade group and we are using their

573
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,340
recommendations in most places for halt

574
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,799
right to make a parking lot or a street

575
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,860
or a sidewalk or a basketball court for

576
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,840
that matter

577
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,559
um

578
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:23,000
I will say that ipsrps are

579
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,580
not necessarily developed in the most

580
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,700
scientific way the most data-driven way

581
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,320
they're generally done by consensus and

582
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,880
I was literally told this by someone who

583
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,080
was on a committee who said they went

584
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,360
into a parking lot and just looked at

585
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,380
each other and said do you think this

586
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,299
looks bright enough and they said they

587
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:40,500
agree yeah it looks bright enough and

588
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,059
that became the recommended practice for

589
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,220
parking lot lighting and this is how

590
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,039
we're doing things in this country and I

591
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,780
will add again another personal note for

592
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,580
me that uh

593
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,620
lighting Engineers tend to see the

594
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,840
solution to every problem anywhere on

595
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,820
the planet to be adding more lighting

596
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,299
and it's really the truth every stop and

597
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,100
say wait a minute why are we talking

598
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,419
about lighting this up in the first

599
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,480
place it just doesn't happen so well

600
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,980
um so again let's look at that in

601
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,299
practice

602
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:13,440
we look at all these roadways and uh

603
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,299
why are they as bright as they are well

604
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,340
nobody really knows actually there's not

605
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,220
data driven analysis that says there

606
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,320
will be this many accidents if these

607
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,820
roads are lit to this level and that

608
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,400
many if they're lit to this level and it

609
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,440
just doesn't happen that way the other

610
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,520
guys the question I would ask about

611
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,260
these pictures is

612
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,659
where the hell are the cars

613
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:34,280
um

614
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,780
if any of these roadways needed to be

615
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,520
lit this much if it actually increased

616
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,640
their safety at rush hour at 7 30 PM say

617
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,340
to have this level of lighting why are

618
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,559
these lights still on at all around at

619
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,020
this brightness at whatever hour this is

620
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,640
when there's not a single vehicle out of

621
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,020
the road

622
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,640
um does this make any sense at all is

623
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,200
this good lighting practice I don't

624
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,700
think so

625
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,320
I'm going to sort of end on a

626
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,640
story that shows that we can do better

627
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,280
so this is the town of Flagstaff Arizona

628
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,020
which for

629
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,720
almost 50 years now has been working at

630
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,100
controlling its outdoor lighting

631
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,320
regulating its outdoor lighting to try

632
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,780
to help preserve the sky and they've

633
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,000
been very successful at it this is the

634
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,760
same sort of analysis the sky glow done

635
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,820
for we have Flagstaff in the top

636
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,860
illustration there with the sky over it

637
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,620
and down in the lower half is one of

638
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,840
Cheyenne Wyoming Cheyenne was picked

639
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,820
because it's the populations exactly the

640
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,100
same as Flagstaff and it's also kind of

641
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,840
set off by itself it's not in a big

642
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,480
urban area with a lot of other

643
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,280
municipalities running into it there

644
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,480
there's 11 times more light this guy

645
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,059
over Cheyenne than there is over

646
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,340
Flagstaff and it isn't that they don't

647
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,159
have lights in Flagstaff

648
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,539
I've been in downtown so I accept a lot

649
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:57,240
at night um it's a college town but you

650
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,860
go on Saturday night but it's dark out

651
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,440
and it's just wrongs of people it's it's

652
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,760
very well like you can see what you're

653
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,919
doing it's just that it's lit properly

654
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,860
it's lit uniformly they use the warm

655
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,080
colored light the Amber lighting there's

656
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,400
no glaring lights in your face and

657
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,720
they're all directed down toward the

658
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,159
ground and just

659
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,020
all right doing those fairly simple

660
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,100
things

661
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,780
this is from

662
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,400
Buffalo Park

663
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,039
where we do a yearly public star party

664
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,440
with telescopes out there level parks in

665
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,120
the city limits of Flagstaff and this is

666
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,820
the sky for both little park so

667
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,299
um it works so we can do a lot better

668
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,400
job

669
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,580
and I'll finish on my challenge to uh

670
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,220
to the creative hacker crowd of the

671
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,159
world with things that we need to do yet

672
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,159
um there's a ton of research that needs

673
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,799
to be done both figuring out techniques

674
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,860
for research and ways to go with things

675
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,419
figuring out how to measure Sky glow

676
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,520
better how to measure these impacts how

677
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,100
to measure the issues with different

678
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,580
light sources this map this is the more

679
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,440
current uh

680
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,919
model of brightness over the lower 48

681
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,380
states this is from 2015 data the

682
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,600
satellite the the data comes from that

683
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,760
this map is derived from

684
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,100
is that the images in it are

685
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,340
functionally blind to Blue Light

686
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,620
they're made to image for weather

687
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,480
Imaging and they don't want the

688
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,279
scattering that you get a blue light in

689
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,380
their nighttime Imaging so they're blind

690
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,120
to Blue Light and we need to see what

691
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,679
this blue light is shining up the sky

692
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,080
all you're seeing in these images is

693
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,720
basically the longer wavelengths of Y so

694
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,880
this is not really good indication on

695
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,860
the level of Sky glow but it's what

696
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,960
we've got we need better satellites so

697
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,159
anybody who wants to build a better

698
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,159
satellite you can come and see me

699
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,539
there's a tremendous amount of data

700
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:49,559
mining that could be done there's

701
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,500
already lots of data out there about

702
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,779
everything from ecological issues human

703
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,700
health things safety issues like those

704
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,220
roadway things the data is out there and

705
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,080
there's also data about light pollution

706
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,559
and Lighting systems and things there's

707
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,320
a lot of correlation that could be done

708
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,799
to provide good research to give us more

709
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,740
tools to work with

710
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,799
this whole question of roadway safety

711
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:19,679
so by far more fatal accidents happen on

712
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,000
the roadways during the daytime at night

713
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,799
but your odds of having accident or

714
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,440
night or higher and that has always been

715
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,360
blamed on it being dark

716
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,559
well of course you have more accident

717
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,600
because it's dark so what we do is we

718
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,640
put in street lights

719
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,980
but the reality is it's well known now

720
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,740
that roadway accidents are heavily

721
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,400
influenced by alcohol and by fatigue

722
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,020
it's also known that both of those

723
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,520
things are much more prevalent at night

724
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,020
than they are during the daytime so how

725
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,820
much of the nighttime increase in

726
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,860
accidents per mile driven is because it

727
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,419
got dark and how much it was because of

728
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:56,700
these other issues and does the lighting

729
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,799
help these other issues at all again

730
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,240
there's data out there on these things

731
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,120
but it needs to be analyzed more

732
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,779
um

733
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:06,659
I have thousands literally of papers

734
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,360
looking at light at night issues from

735
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,279
all across these different

736
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,240
fields from Health to engineering to

737
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,860
ecological things

738
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,740
we don't have one good resource set up

739
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,700
we could definitely use some help with

740
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,039
creating libraries that researchers

741
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,960
could use if say if you're working on

742
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,460
health and you're also interested well I

743
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,500
wonder how this affects the animals you

744
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,640
know these things I'm looking at human

745
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,620
health it'd be great to be able to pull

746
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,779
these things together so I see a real

747
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,340
need for that and then finishing up

748
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,159
there's a lot of always need for

749
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,620
outreach things we need web development

750
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,779
we need video creation and things like

751
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:47,580
that to tell these stories more

752
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,460
effectively in places in the halls in

753
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,200
the halls of power where they matter so

754
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,260
we can get things done so I will finish

755
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,179
up by showing

756
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:59,700
my contact information

757
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,200
um I don't want to take time now and

758
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,580
open up your questions I think I've

759
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,380
probably eaten my time over right about

760
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,659
to the minute so uh that's me I drew at

761
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:10,200
illinoislighting.org that's one of the

762
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,640
organizations that I'm in by Illinois

763
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,320
Branch

764
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,520
um

765
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,100
contact me or see me after when you see

766
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,840
me around here or something or other I

767
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,220
would be glad to answer questions

768
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,740
discuss things more or recruit people

769
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,539
who would actually like to join in on

770
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:26,580
this uh this effort so thank you very

771
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,740
much for your attention

772
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:34,180
[Applause]

773
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:46,639
there we go

774
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:00,020
right here

775
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,650
[Music]

776
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,340
thank you
