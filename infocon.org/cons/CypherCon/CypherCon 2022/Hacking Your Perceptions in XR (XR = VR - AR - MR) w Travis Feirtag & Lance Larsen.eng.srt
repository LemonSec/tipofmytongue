1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,399
[Music]

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,700
thank you

3
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:29,238
[Music]

4
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,218
all right

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,460
foreign

6
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,220
real is simply electrical signals

7
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,420
interpreted by your brain

8
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,860
what's up I'm Lance Travis and Ben uh we

9
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,100
all formed a company called holasoft

10
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,299
holasoft is really a company where we

11
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,820
leave the information age has evolved uh

12
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,500
welcome to the age of experiences and we

13
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,299
like building the XR experiences so

14
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,240
we'll come keep coming back to that

15
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,000
so we also uh run and found in the

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,560
madison.net user group so if you like

17
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,759
the computer if you like to program

18
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,360
computers uh we have the we have an

19
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,280
online group now we'll go back we'll go

20
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,200
back in first at some point in time

21
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,560
uh but let's see can your perception be

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,140
hacked so let's see

23
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,759
the fact that reality is whatever your

24
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,799
mind infers from the nerve impulses sent

25
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,020
by your sensors based on its model of

26
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,540
the world is at the heart of what makes

27
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,758
VR different and more powerful than

28
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,560
anything that has come before pick a

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,379
pill and keep your eyes on it

30
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:17,959
got it let's mask off everything else

31
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,840
interesting you were pretty sure that

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,760
out there in the real world one pill is

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,400
red and one was blue but they're exactly

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,379
the same shade of gray take a good look

35
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,840
at the blue tiles on top of the left

36
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,239
Cube

37
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,520
okay now take a good look at the yellow

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,940
tiles on top of the right Cube

39
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,500
you think those are colors you're seeing

40
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,400
now

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,140
let's mask off everything but those

42
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,099
particular tiles

43
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,440
they're all exactly the same shade of

44
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,780
gray see the white tile under the desk

45
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,000
and the black tiles just outside the

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,180
desk

47
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,440
again let's mask off everything else

48
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,940
and again they're both exactly the same

49
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,739
shade of gray

50
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,900
but if one of them is that is in Shadow

51
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,000
and is that shade of gray it must be

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,780
white

53
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,580
and if another one is in bright light

54
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,440
and is that shade of gray it must be

55
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,400
black

56
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,560
your visual system does the inference

57
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,840
for you automatically and what you see

58
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,360
is white and black rather than gray here

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,000
we have a nice Square checkerboard let's

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,180
add some dots and see what happens

61
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,340
this happens because some line detectors

62
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,019
fire that normally wouldn't be triggered

63
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,879
by a checkerboard rather than looking

64
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,040
orthogonal the corners look bowed

65
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,400
okay that's just weird

66
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,080
here's what's actually happening

67
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,599
real objects especially faces tend to be

68
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,239
convex so your visual system assumes

69
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,220
convexity in the absence of cues to the

70
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,120
contrary

71
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,680
the only way to make that assumption

72
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
work in this case is for the head to be

73
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,000
moving in very odd ways so that's

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,340
exactly what you see

75
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,739
as the Oracle might say here's what's

76
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,360
really going to bake your noodle later

77
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,340
on now that you know what's happening

78
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,160
try to see the dragon as it really is

79
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,820
I bet you can't do it a little bit of

80
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,560
conscious knowledge isn't going to undo

81
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,180
millions of years of evolution in a

82
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,740
lifetime of looking at faces

83
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,740
obviously she's saying Bar Bar Bar now

84
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,040
let's watch a slightly different video

85
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,040
bar

86
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,639
here we can clearly hear her saying far

87
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,500
far far

88
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,900
except that she isn't

89
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,300
the video shows are saying far but the

90
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,400
audio track is still of her saying bar

91
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,259
exactly if she did in the first video

92
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:08,280
the visual input overrode the audio

93
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,139
to make it Crystal Clear what's going on

94
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,240
let's look at this one more time

95
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,340
once again we'll have a soundtrack that

96
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,380
says bar but this time we'll have a

97
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,540
split screen with a face saying far on

98
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,520
one side and a face saying bar on the

99
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,180
other

100
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,520
as this plays move your eyes from one

101
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,979
side to the other and observe how what

102
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,940
you hear changes

103
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,259
so when do you guys hear

104
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,360
as you moved your eyes from one side to

105
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,580
the other did you say you're a change on

106
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,800
that weirded the crap out of me

107
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,220
I mean that was pretty wild so uh so

108
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,680
let's let's step back now that's a that

109
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,539
proved to me that you could have had my

110
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:58,560
perception

111
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,039
uh let's talk about what we can do with

112
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,539
an efforts in that perspective in

113
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,460
regards to Exxon so let's step through

114
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,020
and see what these different

115
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,580
Technologies are

116
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,039
so is this what Dr is can you guys read

117
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,580
that in the back

118
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,699
so heads up this next one's not me

119
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,280
so that's definitely VR for me that's my

120
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,840
favorite game that's what I spend a lot

121
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,460
of time doing my exercise now what

122
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,840
augmented reality

123
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,160
can anyone tell me what augmented

124
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,300
reality is

125
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,220
is it this

126
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,840
is the first thing that we started is

127
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,759
this what got augmented reality into our

128
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,220
vernacular it is for me and it is I

129
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,560
think it actually lent a lot of credence

130
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,440
to what we do on a daily basis that this

131
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,759
was the first thing that got augmented

132
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,680
reality into our vernacular but

133
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,380
augmented reality is also this

134
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,000
this is all about the metadata

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,819
that allows us to negotiate all these

136
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,440
different uh scenarios in this

137
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,819
particular case going through a

138
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,080
warehouse I want to know where that data

139
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,060
is I want to know where that outlet is

140
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,280
this is also meta daily

141
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,020
into where we are in the grocery store

142
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,479
and this is also metadata this is

143
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,220
slightly speculative there are a couple

144
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,780
cars that are actually doing this but

145
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,840
this is going to be amazing a couple a

146
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,340
couple cars that I know as of right now

147
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,560
I have some heads up display is and

148
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,759
they're getting more and more and we'll

149
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,740
get to this

150
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,090
what is mixed reality

151
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,000
[Music]

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,750
[Applause]

153
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:47,599
[Music]

154
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,699
Microsoft hololens brings Holograms into

155
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,759
your real world using transparent lenses

156
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,039
spatial sound and an understanding of

157
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,740
your environment Holograms look and

158
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,300
sound like they're actually part of the

159
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,220
world around you that is mixed reality

160
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,380
if you haven't seen the hololens

161
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,639
hololens allows you to basically use

162
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,060
mixed reality to scan your surrounding

163
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,800
with the sensors it basically has a

164
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,960
connect sensor in the band if you've

165
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,400
ever seen a connect sensor remember the

166
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,500
connect sensors back from the Xbox

167
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,620
exactly famous good stuff uh so it has

168
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,539
that entire cut sensor basically built

169
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:25,800
into the mixer and mixed reality

170
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,720
headsets so that's going to allow us to

171
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,099
do things like this it's a lot of people

172
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,860
just like today we can collaborate in

173
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,440
the scenario of an architectures group I

174
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,000
know I went to college with an

175
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,919
architecture major and the little

176
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,559
freaking toothpicks of wood was burp all

177
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,839
over the room all the time now this is

178
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,060
what they're using

179
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,360
iot heads up displays now we've got all

180
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,580
of these devices that have generated all

181
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,440
this data but they don't have displays

182
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,880
on them we're going to be able to take

183
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,940
that data and turn it into heads up this

184
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,839
way and we'll be able to see in

185
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,480
augmented reality

186
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,459
what is Exxon

187
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,399
XR is literally just extended reality

188
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,720
and it's a combination of b-r-a-r-m-i

189
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,160
how real could xrv

190
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,380
let's look at that

191
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,860
oh no

192
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,260
that is so cool

193
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,839
I'll have to go back I don't want

194
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,940
ah

195
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,560
oh my God oh my God

196
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,459
okay

197
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:04,560
so how does XR work

198
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,180
so

199
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,680
before we start we're going to talk

200
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,839
about degrees of freedom so degrees of

201
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,160
freedoms are the way that users can move

202
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,060
in XR back when we had the the go uh we

203
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,560
only had three degrees of freedom so you

204
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,380
could basically get your your yaw your

205
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,680
pitch and your roll but now with all the

206
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,740
latest devices we have the up down left

207
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,720
right front back so you have the full

208
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,300
degree so you can move through your

209
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,160
reality and it really becomes real at

210
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,420
that point in time

211
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,760
but your result song Works VR

212
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,620
communicates to your brain in a

213
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,180
different way than looking at a stream

214
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,640
when looking at a screen like our TV or

215
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,740
phone our brains read this as a flat

216
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,200
image the same way it would a picture if

217
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,120
an object on the screen gets bigger or

218
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,920
smaller or the person on TV moves

219
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,959
towards the camera you don't feel the

220
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,820
need to take a step back or move out of

221
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,399
their way but in VR you might want to

222
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,079
because you're not looking at one screen

223
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,300
you're looking at two and those two

224
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,279
screens are literally right in front of

225
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,959
your eyes projecting a slightly

226
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,480
different image into each eye which is

227
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,160
how our Vision Works in the real world

228
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,620
each eye takes in stimuli from a

229
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,959
slightly different Vantage plane you can

230
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,880
test this hold your finger up in front

231
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,560
of your face and wink each of your eyes

232
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,899
your finger should jump back and forth

233
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:21,540
that jump is the difference between what

234
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,700
your left and right eye are seeing and

235
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,000
the differences between what your IC

236
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,980
conveys depth it conveys three

237
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,260
dimensions this is known as steriopsis

238
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,240
and VR developers have spent a lot of

239
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,000
time I'm perfecting it but what uses

240
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,579
depth if you can't move through it which

241
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,200
brings us to the next most important way

242
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,600
virtual reality tricks your brain you

243
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,000
are the camera and it's fast enough

244
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,880
where your brain starts interpreting it

245
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,700
as your perspective head tracking allows

246
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,040
a person in VR to look and move around a

247
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,720
fake world in the same way that we look

248
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,120
and move around a real one if you look

249
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,980
to the left you'll see more of the world

250
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,660
to your left and if you look down

251
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,620
[Music]

252
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,800
yeah okay maybe don't look down other

253
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,959
subtle effects make virtual spaces feel

254
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,420
more real like 360 audio which is a big

255
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,640
part of the plank experience as you turn

256
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,380
your head the wind will subtly change

257
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,600
the plank creaks and if you listen

258
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,360
closely a heartbeat slowly begins to

259
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,940
speed up our brain takes all this new

260
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,860
virtual stimuli and begins to believe

261
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,420
this is reality

262
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,740
our brain has never really learned

263
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,560
within the last 150 000 years to

264
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,240
actually distinguish between computer

265
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,060
generated content and the real world Dr

266
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,980
Frank Seneca has been studying immersive

267
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,200
Technologies like VR for nearly 20 years

268
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,480
and if all the cues that we perceive

269
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,040
from the virtual environment are so

270
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,779
similar to the cues that we get in the

271
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,300
real world it is makes kinds of sense

272
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,980
that we are unable to clearly

273
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,019
distinguish between both our brains

274
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,820
quickly adapt to Virtual environments

275
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,160
largely because it's wired to trust our

276
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,779
sense of sight there's some research

277
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,700
showing that approximately 80 percent of

278
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,079
all the information that we perceive

279
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,760
from our environment are based on vision

280
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,740
and this allows VR developers to

281
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,260
manipulate our reality even further we

282
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,959
found out about 10 years ago is that we

283
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,180
if we guide users on a circular Arc with

284
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,399
a radius of 20 meters they have no

285
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,079
chance to identify that they actually

286
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,180
walk on a circle in the real world when

287
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,980
they see a straight path in the virtual

288
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,260
environment you can walk an entire

289
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,540
Virtual City without ever leaving a room

290
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,980
once we believe the environment is real

291
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,200
and accept that we're actually in it our

292
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,940
brains then go on to fill in some other

293
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,740
blanks there are interesting findings

294
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,180
that for example if you are in the

295
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,760
virtual world in a very let's say slow

296
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,120
or icy environment people feel cold

297
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,620
although they're in the real world in a

298
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,779
maybe in a hot environment outside of

299
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,579
games VR has actually shown a lot of

300
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,260
Promise in the medical world from

301
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,180
reducing pain in burn victims by

302
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,800
immersing them in a snowy World while

303
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,779
their bandages are being changed and

304
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,639
with exposure therapy that helps people

305
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,160
with phobias like a fear of heights and

306
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,740
body dysmorphia it's also being used for

307
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,899
physical therapy like assisting elderly

308
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,000
people with their balance right now

309
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,920
we're still Tethered to a system with a

310
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,380
headset on our faces the graphics are

311
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,959
nice but not perfect and so we're not

312
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,120
fully immersed when we hover 80 stories

313
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,339
above the ground that is we can still

314
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,920
remember to take the headset off Seneca

315
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,540
cautions that it might not always be

316
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,339
that way we can easily assume that

317
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,079
within the next five to ten years or so

318
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,360
we will not be able to distinguish

319
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,940
visually computer generated content from

320
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,860
from Real World content anymore and then

321
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,000
of course there are a lot of ethical

322
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,760
questions for now VR might not look

323
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,100
exactly like reality but it follows a

324
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,720
lot of the rules our brain has learned

325
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,420
to perceive as real and that's often

326
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,860
enough to make us sweat

327
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,380
so

328
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,300
through XR our brains become become

329
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,760
accurate recording memories why is this

330
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,880
important because this universe in

331
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,160
Maryland studied nine percent more

332
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,440
accurate between desktop computer

333
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,500
learning and virtual area nine percent

334
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,480
that that's pretty that's pretty

335
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,339
significant on the other hand 12 faster

336
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:15,779
uh traditional training versus VR

337
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:16,860
training

338
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,500
so those don't seem like big numbers but

339
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,940
nine to twelve percent could be the

340
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,740
difference between winning and losing or

341
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,420
an extreme Circumstance the difference

342
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,699
between light and death we're using

343
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,040
these training techniques in the NFL the

344
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,260
trains to train players we're using

345
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,880
these uh training techniques and

346
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,940
education if you can do 97 12 better on

347
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,160
your test and take you from a b to an A

348
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,560
or maybe even from an F to a c and you

349
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,600
live

350
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,079
uh XR activities our XR activates the

351
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,540
motor cortex and our sensory systems in

352
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,240
a way that height is highly analogous to

353
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,519
real life experiences and we can see

354
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,980
that in Mr exam and basically brain

355
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,199
scans and they can look at all of the

356
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:00,480
activation centers of your brain and see

357
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,100
it in your brain who uh has had 150 150

358
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,779
000 years of getting to where we are

359
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,899
essentially or cognitively cannot tell

360
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,160
the difference

361
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,079
between a good VR XR simulation and real

362
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,260
life you maybe know at this point in

363
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,660
time I say at this point in time you

364
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,760
know your brain doesn't know so we can

365
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,279
use that to put you into these scenarios

366
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,560
where you learn a lot better in a more

367
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,320
uh interactive with what we're doing

368
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,019
one thing I always get is you know I

369
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,760
don't want to try VR I get the I get

370
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,600
sick

371
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,720
so let's talk about that really briefly

372
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,959
what is VR sickness uh VR which is also

373
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,040
called VR Motions like this

374
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,540
so if you are sick because the cause is

375
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,519
a conflicting signals from your eyes

376
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,339
versus your inner ear so what your eye

377
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,199
sees and your inner ear as long as they

378
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,839
go together you're good but as soon as

379
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,120
your eye see something and your ear goes

380
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,060
ah I don't I don't sense it the leading

381
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,900
theory is that your brain says holy crap

382
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,140
I've been poisoned and the poison is

383
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,299
actually stopping the coordination

384
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,160
between those two things so when you're

385
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,380
poisoned what do you want to do

386
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,020
you want to do it the pumpkin's done so

387
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,000
that is the leading theory thus far and

388
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,220
it to me it has a lot of credibility

389
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,720
um this I mean I don't get sick on

390
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,359
roller coasters I don't get sick on on

391
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,660
you know cars boats but if you put me in

392
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,559
an uncomfortable game it's no good I'm

393
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,760
not going to be in that game for very

394
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,539
long

395
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,900
so as an XR user what can you do

396
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,179
take comfortable games they have a

397
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,700
rating when you go to get the games uh

398
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,740
pick the ones that are comfortable uh

399
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,260
pick a pick box loss for example is a

400
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,000
fantastic game where you're kind of like

401
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,799
a God over this little mouse and kind of

402
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,299
helping him negotiate you through

403
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,179
territory versus epic roller coaster

404
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,460
vomits I mean ever wrote up a roller

405
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,360
coaster coaster so do that now as an XR

406
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,500
creator

407
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,620
what to do well it's really important

408
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,660
to make sure that we get our frames per

409
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,380
second which when you are running a game

410
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,360
uh every time in a game Loop it keeps

411
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,100
running through that frame and you need

412
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,020
to make to be sure make sure that you're

413
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,020
displaying 60 frames minimum 60 to 90

414
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,200
frames or they get too slow and it can

415
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,799
cause uh it can cause VR sickness at

416
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,840
that same point in time anyone know what

417
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,240
teleportation is in a game

418
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,240
cool so what that basically is do

419
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,799
teleportation versus Force movement

420
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,980
teleportation is the you trick your

421
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,580
brain by doing little leaps so instead

422
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,960
of walking through the game like

423
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,020
dragging through slowly you do little

424
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,880
leaps

425
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,679
and that actually tricks your brain and

426
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,120
you can actually figure out what your

427
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,179
threshold is uh how many little leaps it

428
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,919
takes to go through there there are

429
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,380
things that they're working on uh in the

430
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,900
underlying operating systems uh that

431
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,000
will hopefully just make that ubiquitous

432
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,039
for all games you'll be able to set that

433
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,820
on a per individual basis but right now

434
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,620
take teleportation games or at least

435
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,260
pick that option and go through things I

436
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,360
really like fixed play area games like

437
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,220
beatsaber you're in a fixed place you're

438
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,200
kind of moving yourself space pirate

439
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,940
trainers and another excellent one where

440
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,280
you're kind of moving in your space

441
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,580
um so that's great and choose

442
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,620
I like mixed reality

443
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:37,080
versus versus strictly VR so if you use

444
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,820
Pastor anyone know what pass-through

445
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,380
mode is

446
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,460
so pass-through mode basically shows you

447
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,740
uh in in the quest uh it's really nice

448
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,299
because you basically see the background

449
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:49,980
you see I would see if I had the quest

450
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,020
set on now I would see a black and white

451
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,179
version of the entire crowd and that

452
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:55,860
gives me a really good reference to the

453
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,260
world so that I when I move around I've

454
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,419
got a very comfortable scenario I'm not

455
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,760
basically completely immersing unmvr

456
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,419
scenario so those are my tricks

457
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,700
um one thing that a lot that they're

458
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,200
working on now that I've seen some very

459
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,539
progress and the good progress on is

460
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,500
something called Galvin galvanic uh

461
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,780
vestibular stimulate stimulation GDs

462
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,740
that's stimulus there you go thank you I

463
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,620
got a call on call for experts uh so

464
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,419
that they do is they Place little pads

465
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,700
on your skin and send a 3d motion

466
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,799
signals to your inner ear tricking your

467
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,440
brain into feeling what you're seeing so

468
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,480
when they do that and they coordinate it

469
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,820
with what you're seeing visually you can

470
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,799
actually get rid of all those scenarios

471
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,900
but again that right now relies on

472
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,260
little paths attached to your head

473
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,880
so let's get the hacker

474
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,039
uh response so I'm gonna say we have

475
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,960
three categories just like most hackers

476
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,640
we have three categories here we've got

477
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,220
the white hackers in regards to VR and

478
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,539
these are people that are responsible

479
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:03,059
experimentations uh beneficial

480
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,220
manipulations

481
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,880
um then you have the gray hackers uh

482
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,220
irresponsible experimentations selfless

483
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,480
manipulations and addictions maybe

484
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,059
that's a company that puts uh

485
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,720
did you guys know that uh um if you give

486
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,539
little brief Snippets of cats popping up

487
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:24,059
that it actually triggers uh endorphins

488
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,100
in your brain that make you happy I

489
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,660
believe that explains the entirety of

490
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,280
the Internet by the way

491
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,539
so

492
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,580
you can have a little pop-up kittens

493
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,900
little pop-up things and that actually

494
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,820
makes it so you pay attention more for

495
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,440
the next 30 seconds scientifically

496
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,179
proven that you pay attention for the

497
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,559
next 30 seconds more than you did

498
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,840
previously if you did not don't know

499
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,980
that those kittens the puppies are

500
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,000
popping up

501
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,340
uh so that's an interesting one and then

502
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,440
obviously we have the black hackers they

503
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,480
can do malicious things and purple heart

504
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,919
purposeful harm and we'll talk through

505
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,900
some of those scenarios what those

506
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,180
purposeful harm can be

wow what a future that could potentially

550
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,760
be I mean there were a lot of great

551
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,740
things look at this part remember when

552
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,020
the road clears and it gives you really

553
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,320
clear information about a second because

554
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,880
someone is coming right yeah that

555
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,559
somebody's talking to me that that

556
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,179
safety you're under the road you know

557
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,799
the good you know the road get out of

558
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,820
the way it's going to give you some

559
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,960
information contextual information

560
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,059
there's a lot of great information in

561
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:24,000
there but however when this happens

562
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,820
that wasn't supposed to happen not the

563
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,799
half of getting in there

564
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,900
and then this

565
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,760
you can't take out your augmented

566
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,799
reality potentially maybe she has

567
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,240
contacts on

568
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,100
she can't take it off this person's

569
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,320
digitally masked themselves

570
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,299
and garbled their face so they can't see

571
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,700
what who they are and they're able to

572
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,559
come in there and then get a bio a bio

573
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,940
scan Trace from her getting her blood

574
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,919
okay theoretical not here yet but I find

575
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,140
that that has got both really good

576
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,360
points and really bad points and when

577
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,100
we're talking about really hacking your

578
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,820
perception that is absolutely perfect

579
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,140
analogy of what we're going to do

580
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,480
so now

581
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,039
this is again this is the part where

582
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,360
we're going to have more interactive

583
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,340
even more than we have so far let's

584
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,220
analyze some vulnerabilities together

585
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,440
what are the vulnerabilities here

586
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,620
first of all what is this

587
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,520
setting up the bathroom absolutely

588
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,020
correct

589
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,640
what are the vulnerabilities that people

590
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,380
think could potentially happen here if

591
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,059
somebody is able to get access to your

592
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,480
headset

593
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,039
you can block them into other dangerous

594
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,720
things you could welcome them very

595
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,120
interesting things uh what if it's near

596
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,460
your stairs and you as somebody could

597
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,100
basically extend that boundary slightly

598
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,320
out past that stance

599
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,419
very fascinating they've actually done a

600
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:48,299
study with this a lot of games are you

601
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:49,919
know pretty pretty stationary in the

602
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,140
middle they did something called the the

603
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,679
human joystick effect and you're able to

604
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,340
take that person and just subtly move

605
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,500
them and they don't realize that they're

606
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,940
moving because the environment looks

607
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,000
like it's 99 stable and the person

608
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,580
starts in one location and they take the

609
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,679
headset off and they're in a completely

610
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,000
different location they don't know how

611
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,799
they got there

612
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:17,039
yeah I mean again you could the the

613
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,140
researchers made some really wild Flames

614
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,179
at this point in time like maybe you're

615
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:22,740
trying to assassinate that person and

616
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,120
you maneuver them in front of a window

617
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,899
but a little while but still the ability

618
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:30,600
that you're controlling their particular

619
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,840
environment have you gives you a lot of

620
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,880
control over what they're doing

621
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,200
yeah

622
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,279
who knows what this is

623
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,899
and you're looking at your desktop this

624
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:47,760
is the way a lot of us are going to work

625
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,620
moving forward at some point in time

626
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,539
probably closely than we expected to be

627
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:53,460
and this is amazing you're able to have

628
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,500
a full keyboard you have to have all

629
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,120
your monitors outlayed in front of you

630
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,500
how many tabs you can have open metals

631
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,419
tabs all over your house you know what I

632
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:07,020
always I always say on my laptop I have

633
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,960
a tab addiction uh I have half the

634
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,760
memory for the operating system and half

635
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,640
the memory for Chrome

636
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,700
oh my God

637
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,880
and so but in this particular scenario

638
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,679
now we've got pass-through motor we got

639
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:25,380
something else like Pastor mode what are

640
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,240
the possibilities of if I'm a hacker and

641
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,399
have access to your system and Facebook

642
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,260
and meta haven't done a nice job of

643
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,860
securing this

644
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:37,679
you could

645
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,220
just like you can make what a capacitor

646
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,760
looks like because you can control

647
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,340
absolutely if you can take that data

648
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,220
and and be able to see it and then

649
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,600
manipulate it

650
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,520
you can absolutely change it but what

651
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,179
else about what about recording it yeah

652
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:58,919
ah what if you're going to have the

653
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,080
ability potentially again if it's a nice

654
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,580
job the med has done a really nice job

655
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,460
so far to with my experience of making

656
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,260
so developers don't have access to this

657
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,880
but they're not the only device in town

658
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,480
you can scan an entire entire like areas

659
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,820
of course

660
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,080
data and like have that all mapped up

661
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,059
yep you thought there were companies

662
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:20,059
that freaked out about Pokemon go yeah

663
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:22,200
literally freaked out you can't play

664
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,120
Pokemon go in our location because it's

665
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,460
it's whoever recording every bit of data

666
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,799
about our location did you invite giant

667
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,600
copies literally banned him

668
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,659
a game on your phone you're looking out

669
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:35,340
the window so you can catch landmarks

670
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,100
and stuff and be able to physically yeah

671
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,960
that's exactly right exactly you could

672
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,120
know exactly where the if their device

673
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,500
didn't tell you enough about where they

674
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,299
were you can basically figure out where

675
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:49,200
they are by by locator yeah so do those

676
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,000
snaps have glasses that they have lots

677
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,500
here today at the same kind of

678
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,659
capability of whether or not like to

679
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:57,679
triangulate like

680
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,419
so the triangulation happens at a

681
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:03,360
machine learning level yeah so as long

682
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,159
as they have the ability to capture that

683
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,899
video that's a possibility

684
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:10,919
so

685
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,919
but on the other hand there's a lot of

686
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,080
huge benefits from these things so the

687
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,640
question is we gotta Leverage The you

688
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,140
know we gotta weigh one versus the other

689
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,179
any anything else anyone thought about

690
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,419
here

691
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,820
let's go to this one now my device can

692
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,260
see my hands

693
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,899
you can see how I'm moving

694
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:32,399
what can what else what do you think

695
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,120
what's the problem with this

696
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,959
fingerprint somebody based on

697
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,760
they move

698
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,760
what they're actually typing yep that's

699
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,000
exactly right there

700
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,799
you got all their passwords by seeing

701
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,659
where their fingers are every single one

702
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,039
of them

703
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,620
talk about the the the man in the middle

704
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,679
kind of attack

705
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:09,300
but we'll tidy this into a second with

706
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,399
something else you have the ability to

707
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:15,000
see every way this person moves

708
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,879
you could build a digital twin of this

709
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:20,118
person

710
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:26,480
so the way you like you're doing

711
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:30,659
that like I know I've heard there to be

712
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,820
away with like the way that you tie them

713
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,520
selves a little ad into that kind of

714
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,679
Security will you be able to recreate

715
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,619
that through like actually

716
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:43,020
well as long as we can see what keys

717
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:47,099
they're typing right

718
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,440
I mean you're gonna be able to get

719
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,300
literally the entire Cadence of the way

720
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,280
that they're interacting

721
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,440
so that's something we got to watch out

722
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,619
for

723
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,700
I mean even if you can't see the

724
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,000
keyboard extrapolate enough data yeah

725
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,119
the distance between keys to figure out

726
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,260
exactly it's almost like a crypto a

727
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,500
crypto what is it crypto Cypher key

728
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,780
basically you figure out the bait on the

729
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,000
frequency that they hit X Y and Z key

730
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,160
you can then derive based on the

731
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,380
distance based on the frequency all of

732
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,180
the keys that they're doing

733
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,220
so what about this scenario that we

734
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,839
showed earlier this is the heads up

735
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:26,400
display

736
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,280
headless to send us this way

737
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,260
so this is the iot scenario there's a

738
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,460
lot of data coming from these devices

739
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,900
and these guys see these green these

740
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,880
these uh scanners and say oh it's green

741
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,440
it's good

742
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,980
what if it's not good yeah the boilers

743
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,440
will make the boiler explode you can

744
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,140
control all of that data at that point

745
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,440
in time

746
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,020
what about this one

747
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,259
foreign

748
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,720
actually 55. or hey

749
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,119
there are so many ways that depending on

750
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,579
the opacity of your windshield

751
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,740
uh I mean if it's able to go ahead this

752
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,200
is actually already in case they mandate

753
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,420
backup cameras on cars and they're thin

754
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,220
cases where the video feed will

755
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,160
momentarily freeze people keep backing

756
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,400
up because it's a clear view

757
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,099
because the the picture froze for just a

758
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:29,099
second I don't know that's but this of

759
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:30,900
course is way more you know but that's

760
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:36,119
cool that's something that exists so

761
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,280
yeah we've been taking people all kinds

762
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,560
of strange ways how about this one

763
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:50,610
[Music]

764
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,739
[Applause]

765
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:03,859
[Music]

766
00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:07,619
he looks pretty good I have to put you

767
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:09,540
down to deep bank and then on top of

768
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,240
that so now we've got deep phase and we

769
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,359
know all the way that you move

770
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,640
you can make a complete digital tweet

771
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,200
himself right now

772
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,940
and take it over take over that

773
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,280
particular way my mom already did that

774
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,860
here

775
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,899
[Music]

776
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,720
nice all right

777
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,760
we're gonna be at the end here here's

778
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,780
something that I thought that was

779
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,540
passing VR diet

780
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,240
food that is virtually enlarged to be 50

781
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,460
bigger leads to 10 percent less

782
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,720
consumption

783
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,820
and while and while food that is

784
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,520
virtually shrunk by 30 makes people eat

785
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,540
15 more

786
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,760
so this this was a Japanese researcher

787
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,680
and the papers online and it's

788
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,180
fascinating and he was able to

789
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,520
manipulate that and over the scan of a

790
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,500
number of people was able to determine

791
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,140
these figures so what I mean if we

792
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,520
started having these nice augmented

793
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,260
reality views and we want to go on a

794
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,040
diet

795
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,740
we have VR start changing our food they

796
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,859
also did a study that uh you could

797
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:22,920
change the color of the drinks or of the

798
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,220
food and change how appealing they are

799
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,280
wherein you could actually take a pretty

800
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,220
pretty bland piece of food and actually

801
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,160
make the person perceive that it tasted

802
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,700
much better than it was after the fact

803
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,599
so these little things are really

804
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,540
amazing

805
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,099
question when they figure out this size

806
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,579
paper

807
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,940
cookies it does I know I would look like

808
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,500
Robert Downey Jr to my wife

809
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,599
[Music]

810
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,420
all right so we're gonna finish a little

811
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,800
bit early here but we have plenty of

812
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,619
time for questions here's my takeaway as

813
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,900
long as we responsibly approach the

814
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,240
future of XR with our eyes wide open to

815
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,180
the dangers the good that comes from XR

816
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,599
will greatly outweigh the bad enjoy the

817
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,180
XR of the day and look forward to the XR

818
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,660
of tomorrow so I think that's pretty

819
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,880
good I mean I would add to that please

820
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,119
coming from a company that has lots of

821
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,020
social controversial yes XR just like

822
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,599
social media platforms is a tool a tool

823
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,940
like a hammer can be used to build a

824
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,040
house or whatever you use to smash your

825
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,500
kneecaps yeah yeah yes exactly

826
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,940
everything's everything people who who

827
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,640
equates uh only bad that things aren't

828
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,619
looking nearly at the benefits that they

829
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:58,380
can basically bring with people so uh

830
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,980
if you're interested in uh programming

831
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,099
XR or anything along that line I had a

832
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:06,720
series of blog posts on there to get 30

833
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,460
requests

834
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,380
um please hop on there this I actually

835
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,839
show you how to go through uh and set up

836
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:15,000
your quest set up pass-through set up

837
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,160
controllers all kinds of stuff so this

838
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,300
is really

839
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,720
I love this view we love this view we

840
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,720
see the huge potential and we're doing a

841
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,579
lot of work in this particular field but

842
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:28,680
we know that there are not nearly enough

843
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,420
we can't do it all

844
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,579
and they're not nearly enough smart

845
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,680
people basically working on these

846
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,180
problems and are going to capitalize on

847
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,640
so we're trying to basically while we

848
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,280
learn our path and how to do it spread

849
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,140
that why spread it out to everybody here

850
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,540
and spread that along across the world

851
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,599
um so get involved and basically give

852
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:50,400
yourself the tool and first of all give

853
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,980
yourself the prop for being here

854
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,260
and watching these talks and engaging

855
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,540
Beyond nine to five

856
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,400
so you should all be very proud of

857
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,079
yourself for basically being here and

858
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,940
taking this time to invest in you

859
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,920
yourself and your future so thank you

860
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,440
very much

00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,579
