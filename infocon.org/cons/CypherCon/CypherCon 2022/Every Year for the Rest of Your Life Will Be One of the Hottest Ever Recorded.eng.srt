[Music]

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,920
okay

4
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,839
oh

5
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,800
hello

6
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,920
um

7
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,080
my name is bruce

8
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,000
and i'm a physician

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,240
uh retired from

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,720
practice of pathology

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,479
and i'm very grateful for the

12
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,119
opportunity to talk to you about the

13
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,159
health effects of climate change

14
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,880
there's a handout that goes with my talk

15
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,280
and it should be on the

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,040
website of site ciphercon does it

17
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,159
has anyone encountered it

18
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,840
okay well mike getzman told me that my

19
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,560
handout is available to everyone

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,880
and and you should check it out because

21
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,200
it has all the references i'm not going

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,159
to

23
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,880
show you all the references in my talk

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,439
and also the handout might be better

25
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,799
than the talk

26
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,439
um another thing i have is i have these

27
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,040
wallet cards they have uh what i think

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,520
are the best five websites for

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,920
scientific information about climate

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,560
change i just wanted to talk

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
if i could pass it down to you

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,399
and you could uh

33
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,440
just let and uh they're especially good

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,920
if you know uh teenagers that are

35
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,319
interested in computers

36
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,680
um

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,239
anyway those the websites on there will

38
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,160
tell you everything there is to know

39
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,359
about climate change

40
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,720
okay

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,720
um

42
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,319
climate change

43
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,120
is

44
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,440
probably the most important event in

45
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,920
your life if you are less than 30 years

46
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,120
old

47
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,800
and climate change

48
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,280
is going to be the biggest medical

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,519
problem of this century

50
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,280
by 2050

51
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,239
it's it's estimated that more people

52
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,879
will die from climate change than will

53
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,879
die from heart disease

54
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,400
or cancer

55
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,640
or diabetes

56
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,000
and

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,640
you can see this statement that was made

58
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,959
by the lancet commission on climate

59
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,239
change

60
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,480
probably have some of you heard of the

61
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,920
medical journal of the lancet

62
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,560
well anyway the lance is a british

63
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,440
medical journal and occasionally you

64
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,440
hear about them in the news

65
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,840
and in

66
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,080
2014 they put together a commission

67
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,640
to study the health aspects of climate

68
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,920
change and this quotation was from the

69
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,040
first report by the lancet commission

70
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,720
and on my handout you'll see the most

71
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,920
recent the 2021 report

72
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,000
by the lancet commission

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,720
and uh it gives you probably the single

74
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,319
best summary

75
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,560
of health and climate that there that

76
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,239
you can find

77
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,080
um

78
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,439
now the thing is

79
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,640
it doesn't have to be this way

80
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,599
we can actually change the world and we

81
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,760
have to

82
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,639
by eliminating the combustion of fossil

83
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,759
fuels

84
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,600
from our economy

85
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,560
and

86
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,840
we can have a much healthier world

87
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,520
by doing that

88
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,560
and and much better for our children

89
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,320
and grandchildren

90
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,600
so

91
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,960
right now

92
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,919
we if we make

93
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,199
very significant changes maybe you might

94
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,520
i might say drastic changes

95
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,919
we can make the world a lot better

96
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,960
instead of a lot worse

97
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,240
now the way

98
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,639
that what the way we cause climate

99
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,680
change

100
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,639
is that fossil fuel combustion

101
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,880
releases greenhouse gases into the

102
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,400
atmosphere

103
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,440
and these retain heat on earth that

104
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,520
would otherwise be released to outer

105
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,759
space probably you've all heard that

106
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,840
you're familiar with that idea and i'll

107
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,600
try to explain it a little bit more

108
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,840
later

109
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,160
well

110
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,840
i'm going to start with the mental

111
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,520
health effects of climate change

112
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,400
i'm not a psychiatrist or psychologist

113
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,520
i'm a pathologist so i'm taking this

114
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,120
information from

115
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,919
uh

116
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,840
you can see at the bottom of the slide

117
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,960
mental health and our changing climate

118
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,240
it's a report from the american

119
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,800
psychological association

120
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,680
and

121
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,360
um

122
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,520
and

123
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,000
but but one thing you might do

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,639
and that i would advise if you really

125
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,880
want to understand climate change is to

126
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,680
read this novel never let me go

127
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,000
uh by ishiguro

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,120
and i i think that this novel takes us

129
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,400
to the like the true heart of darkness

130
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,280
of climate change uh this is a science

131
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,800
fiction novel

132
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,360
and it uh i'm not going to tell you the

133
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,039
story but i believe my interpretation is

134
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,039
that this is a novel about climate

135
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,240
change it doesn't openly say that in the

136
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
book

137
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,000
but it's only my opinion

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,800
and uh you might read it and think i'm

139
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,440
mistaken but but anyway for what it's

140
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,160
worth i think if you could only read one

141
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,639
thing about climate change i would read

142
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,280
never let me go um

143
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,039
okay so

144
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,479
uh

145
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,840
younger people

146
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,000
are subject to

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,680
serious

148
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,840
mental health problems

149
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,960
that are related to climate change

150
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,479
and younger people

151
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,599
suffer more than older people like me

152
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,800
because

153
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,880
it's their life it's their life that's

154
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,759
being uh that's being harmed

155
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,720
and

156
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,960
according to the american psychological

157
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,840
association younger people feel fear

158
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,039
well i feel fear and i'm not young but i

159
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,720
feel plenty of fear

160
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,520
anger and despair and betrayal

161
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,680
um

162
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,840
now this is a slide that i took off the

163
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,440
internet i don't know who took the

164
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,479
picture

165
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,639
uh but this is from

166
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,160
a a

167
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,160
student climate strike in dublin in 2018

168
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,639
and i like the sign that illustrates the

169
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,919
concept of anger and betrayal

170
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,440
that people feel because of

171
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,080
their futures being tossed away by

172
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,639
climate change

173
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,840
okay so

174
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,440
then now we're going to talk about

175
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,599
mainly the physical health effects of

176
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,000
climate change for a bit

177
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,520
uh and

178
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,160
i want to start with a study by the

179
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,720
american college of physicians the

180
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,800
american college of physicians is an

181
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,280
organization that is in charge of

182
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,720
certifying

183
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,879
doctors to be internal medicine

184
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,840
specialists so all the internal medicine

185
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,720
specialists in the united states have to

186
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,039
be approved by the american college of

187
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,479
physicians

188
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,680
and

189
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
in 2016

190
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,240
they put together their own committee to

191
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,360
study health and climate change and they

192
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,199
issued a report

193
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,599
which was from a medical journal called

194
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,000
annals of internal medicine you probably

195
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,919
haven't heard of that but among

196
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,640
physicians it's a very famous journal

197
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,799
just like if you talk to me about a

198
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,799
computer journal i wouldn't know what

199
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,958
you were talking about

200
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,839
so

201
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,600
they predicted uh

202
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,360
what you can i know you can read the

203
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
slide without me reading it so i won't

204
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,839
do that but what i wanted to emphasize

205
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,920
was that they predicted that climate

206
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,519
change would cause

207
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,640
um

208
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,279
food insecurity and they thought that

209
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,839
would be one of the main problems that

210
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,399
climate change would cause for us

211
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,959
and and they predicted

212
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,399
that

213
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,959
the two biggest bread baskets in the

214
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:11,920
world

215
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,839
which are the united states midwest

216
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,360
where we all live

217
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,600
and the ukraine

218
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
would be devastated by climate change

219
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,839
and would cause

220
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,640
a decline in production of graves

221
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,880
and and i think

222
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,279
i think this is interesting in light of

223
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,440
russia's invasion of the ukraine is it

224
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,720
possible

225
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,279
uh that vladimir putin read the report

226
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,240
or is aware of this and he said well i

227
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,320
should really get my hands on the grain

228
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,839
in the ukraine

229
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,080
um i don't know this that's pure

230
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,240
speculation

231
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,680
so

232
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
i also want to point out waterborne

233
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,160
diseases the reason that

234
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,880
that climate change increases waterborne

235
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,959
diseases is because there will be more

236
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,480
floods and in fact wisconsin and the

237
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,560
northern part of the midwest

238
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,800
and also the northeast the new england

239
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,519
states are going to be the victims of

240
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,880
more flooding

241
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,200
and when you have flooding

242
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,320
then you have a contamination of our

243
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,240
water sources by sewage and by

244
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,360
manure

245
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,640
and by

246
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,360
other chemicals so that

247
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,600
we lose fresh water

248
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,760
and if you don't hear about it on the

249
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,640
news but every time there's a big flood

250
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,480
uh people get sick from diarrheal and

251
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,680
gastrointestinal illnesses

252
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,040
um

253
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,160
so

254
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,560
floods cause more waterborne diseases

255
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,040
now vector-borne diseases those that

256
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,680
means diseases that are carried by

257
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,640
insects and ticks and these increase

258
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,680
because

259
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,320
the insects and ticks are moving towards

260
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,120
the poles as it gets warmer and i'll

261
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,880
talk more about that later but i just

262
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,120
wanted you to understand so so that

263
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,760
report is from the american college of

264
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,680
physicians

265
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,079
uh the next report i wanted to talk

266
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,959
about is from a group called the u.s

267
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,279
intelligence community

268
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,760
and the u.s intelligence community

269
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,160
consists of the fbi

270
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,120
and the cia and the national security

271
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,320
agency

272
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,760
and at that time this was in 2018

273
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,920
this is the most recent report that's

274
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,560
available and this is a public report

275
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,519
you can look it up online and i think

276
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,200
the reference is in my handout

277
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,839
anyway this one was written by daniel

278
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,360
colts who used to be the director but no

279
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,519
longer is the director

280
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,160
and you can see what he predicted

281
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,920
a warming world

282
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,399
water and food shortages

283
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,839
and i know you can read the slide um

284
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,600
now i wanted to mention forced

285
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,320
population migration and what this means

286
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,440
is that

287
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,800
when the climate becomes uh so severely

288
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,920
harmed

289
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,600
sometimes people are forced to move away

290
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,440
and seek a new home

291
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,360
and an example of this that we're

292
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,440
familiar with is

293
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,519
that new orleans is going to have to be

294
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,639
evacuated and already many people have

295
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,519
moved away from there and probably in

296
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,920
the future miami will have to be

297
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,959
evacuated but the places that are going

298
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,519
to really be hit the hardest are

299
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,160
the middle east from bangladesh

300
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,839
to israel it's going to be calm too hot

301
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,680
for people to live there

302
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,000
and uh so uh

303
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,399
i'll talk about this more later but

304
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,839
anyway people will be forced to migrate

305
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,399
away from that from places where they

306
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,240
live because of

307
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,000
the severity of climate change

308
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,040
larger wildfires everybody already knows

309
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,279
about that it's in the news every day

310
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,079
i'll talk about ocean acidification let

311
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,399
me just mention it briefly now

312
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,399
carbon dioxide is

313
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,200
the main greenhouse gas that we release

314
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,680
from industrial processes

315
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,200
and and that carbon dioxide dissolves

316
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,480
into the ocean

317
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,959
partly

318
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,240
carbon dioxide is soluble

319
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,639
slightly soluble in water

320
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,680
and when it goes into water it reacts to

321
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,880
form carbonic acid now if you just look

322
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,920
in your mind think you have co2 and you

323
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,720
have h2o if you add them together you

324
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,800
get h2co3

325
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,000
that's carbonic acid and so

326
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,560
when we release carbon dioxide

327
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,320
into the atmosphere

328
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,399
some of it a fraction of it goes into

329
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,760
the ocean uh roughly a fourth

330
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,560
and it makes the ocean more acidic so

331
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
a side effect of

332
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,920
of warming that's not related to warming

333
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,839
itself is ocean acidification okay

334
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,079
um

335
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,639
all right now

336
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,800
uh here is another report this is from

337
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,079
the united states army the us army war

338
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,199
college

339
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,240
uh

340
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,600
issued a report in 2019 about climate

341
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,160
change and and again this all these

342
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,240
references i talk about are on the

343
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,519
handout so

344
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,639
that's why the handout is good

345
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,680
and

346
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,160
and i wanted to point out that the army

347
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,000
is worried about geopolitical

348
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,519
instability

349
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,120
and what they say

350
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,720
is that

351
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,880
there's not going to be

352
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,920
enough fresh water for everybody

353
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,000
if the if the amount of fresh water

354
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,199
declines from floods and

355
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,399
and drought

356
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,480
and other climate problems well

357
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,880
in that case they are concerned that

358
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,079
there will be disputes between countries

359
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,360
or between

360
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,320
large groups over fresh water and the

361
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,360
example they give is that

362
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,639
china and pakistan and india

363
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,240
all depend on water that melts out of

364
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,399
the himalayan mountains

365
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,120
and so if one of those three was to

366
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,560
claim that that that water belongs to

367
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,680
them and not one of the others then that

368
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,480
would be the kind of geopolitical

369
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,920
instability

370
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,279
that

371
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,240
the u.s army is concerned about another

372
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,199
concern that the army raises is that

373
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,639
when the

374
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,920
arctic ice melts which which is

375
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,240
estimated to be about 2040 by about 2040

376
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,160
the earth will be warm enough that the

377
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,639
arctic ocean will no longer

378
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,920
have ice in the summer it'll still have

379
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,399
ice in the winter when it gets cold but

380
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,480
then it'll completely fall this summer

381
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,120
and the army said well we have no plans

382
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,800
at the present time

383
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,320
for defending the united states from

384
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
either china or russia

385
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,040
should they send a fleet into the arctic

386
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,079
ocean

387
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,120
so it would give us a new a new front

388
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,440
you might say to defend

389
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,880
um also relating the soldiers the army

390
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,160
said that their policy of giving water

391
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,800
to soldiers during combat is inadequate

392
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,680
it would not work under the new hot

393
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,160
conditions that they might have to face

394
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,519
and they have to create a new policy for

395
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,880
moving water

396
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,800
another thing they're concerned about is

397
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,279
uh tropical diseases they expect to

398
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,399
increase

399
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,759
among soldiers um

400
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,519
let's see

401
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,680
oh and they do meant they also mentioned

402
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,639
that

403
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,639
uh and i think everybody knows this that

404
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,440
we have sort of an aging power grid and

405
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,480
that as it becomes hotter in the summer

406
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,599
there may be more power blackouts

407
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,359
because we can't meet the demand

408
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,240
okay

409
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,280
so this is my own personal list

410
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,039
of um

411
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,839
of the problems caused by climate change

412
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,559
to health problems and

413
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,599
a lot of these i already talked about um

414
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,079
but i was going to mention uh

415
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,480
extreme heat when a person is out in

416
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,880
extreme heat they can develop what's

417
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,360
called heat stroke the medical term is

418
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,000
called hyperthermia and that means that

419
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,200
you lose the temperature regulation of

420
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,840
your body and it's like if you had a

421
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,960
fever

422
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,600
and these people are usually about 104

423
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,760
degrees you have a fever but you don't

424
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,240
have an infection you have

425
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,520
an incorrect thermostat you might say in

426
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,640
your body

427
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,559
and and when a person is subjected to a

428
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,520
really hot temperature say 100 degrees

429
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,840
for several hours without

430
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,960
relief

431
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,600
that's when they may get hyperthermia

432
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,039
okay

433
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,200
there's also a new disease it's called

434
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,679
kidney disease chronic kidney disease of

435
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,240
unknown etiology that means the cause

436
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,520
isn't known

437
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,400
but it's closely related to heat and it

438
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,640
it only started it was only discovered

439
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,480
in the 1980s

440
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,320
and it's

441
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,240
people who work in

442
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,880
tropical countries outside

443
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,039
for long hours in the heat

444
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,440
after about two years they develop

445
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,840
kidney failure

446
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,039
and

447
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,080
and it's because it appears to be

448
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,640
because they are in so much heat that

449
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,320
they become dehydrated every day

450
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,880
these are usually people who are poor

451
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,280
and they have bad working conditions

452
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,840
they can't drink all the water that

453
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,960
maybe they would like to and um they may

454
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,760
they work long hours so far this has not

455
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,840
occurred in the united states it's

456
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,080
occurred in uh in central america

457
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,679
and in india

458
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,919
and sri lanka

459
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,360
and egypt

460
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,679
all all really hot countries but it's

461
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,280
called

462
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,760
chronic kidney disease of unknown

463
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,559
etiology

464
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,640
oh i should mention more powerful

465
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,320
hurricanes

466
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,799
a hurricane

467
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,320
takes heat

468
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,400
that is in the water

469
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,400
and it converts it into wind energy

470
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,000
uh and and in a sense this this is a a

471
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,799
hurricane is like an engine that uses

472
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,400
heat to do work

473
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,200
and the work that it does is

474
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,799
wind okay

475
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,679
so

476
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,160
if we make the ocean hotter

477
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,000
then on average

478
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,640
the hurricanes will become more powerful

479
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,799
there might not be more hurricanes and

480
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,200
i'm not saying that there will be more

481
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,559
hurricanes but the ones that occur

482
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,120
on average will be more powerful

483
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,559
and and actually in the last few years

484
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,919
the number of

485
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,480
category three four and five hurricanes

486
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,360
has increased

487
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,799
so

488
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,360
more powerful hurricanes is another

489
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,280
health problem

490
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
i think probably everybody knows about

491
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,919
rising sea levels if you

492
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,039
if you warm water then the volume of the

493
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,520
water increases very slightly like if

494
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,640
you warm water in a glass you can't see

495
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
that the volume increased it's a tiny

496
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,919
amount but if you warm the whole ocean

497
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,799
where the volume of water is immense

498
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,840
then you have rising sea level also

499
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,200
if you melt

500
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,840
a glacier and the glacier is located on

501
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,679
land and the water runs into the ocean

502
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,640
then you have rising sealant

503
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,240
so right now

504
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,960
about half of the sea level rise that's

505
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,000
occurred

506
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,440
is due to

507
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,360
thermal

508
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,840
thermal expansion of water and about

509
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,400
half is due to the melting of glaciers

510
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,679
on land if you melt the glacier

511
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,080
on the ocean it's already on the ocean

512
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,159
then it doesn't change

513
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,039
the height of the water okay

514
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,480
so

515
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,760
the fir so

516
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,240
what i was going to do now before i go

517
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,960
on

518
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,120
is to stop and see if there are any

519
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,679
questions or comments or anything that

520
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,240
anybody would like to say about these

521
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
health things or these reports that i've

522
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,559
gone over

523
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,200
okay well the next thing i'll i'll do is

524
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,280
i'll show you a few examples a few

525
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,000
health examples and the first one comes

526
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,080
from

527
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,600
the us army medical cert not us army the

528
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,720
u.s military medical service the the

529
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,080
military

530
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,360
has a combined medical service so that

531
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,400
regardless of what branch you're in

532
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,480
you're in the same health system it's a

533
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,159
single health system

534
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,679
and uh they did and they collect data on

535
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,360
all sorts of things

536
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,720
and a

537
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,760
a newspaper an online newspaper it's

538
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,720
called inside climate news

539
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,360
asked permission to look at their data

540
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,320
on heat stroke in the military so the

541
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,640
military didn't make this graph

542
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,280
that the the inside climate news made

543
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,440
the grass but they took the numbers they

544
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,159
got permission from the military to take

545
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,480
the numbers and make them into a graph

546
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,360
and

547
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,080
and uh i think you can see that in the

548
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,840
navy in the air force

549
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,960
the

550
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,520
the incidence of heat stroke has not

551
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,919
really changed and what we this

552
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,679
incidence its rate

553
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,200
per thousand so on the y-axis it's the

554
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,919
number of people who have heat stroke

555
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,000
out of a thousand okay

556
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,559
but you can see that in the army and the

557
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,840
marine corps

558
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,400
roughly speaking the number of cases of

559
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,039
heat stroke has doubled uh over the

560
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,840
10-year period of this of the data

561
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,960
collection

562
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,360
um now this was not

563
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,200
um

564
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,600
they didn't start they just took all the

565
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,400
cases okay so these are just all the

566
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,440
cases in the entire u.s military system

567
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,280
so they didn't like say are they in a

568
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,520
hot place or a cool place stuff like

569
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,559
that

570
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,120
all they did was take the raw data and

571
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,559
put it on a graph

572
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,360
so

573
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,919
anyway this is the evidence that

574
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,320
heat stroke is becoming a bigger problem

575
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,279
in the armed forces

576
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,640
now this is a study from canada and it

577
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,360
came it came out in a medical journal

578
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,240
called trends and parasitology i'm sure

579
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,919
you never heard of it it's kind of an

580
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,679
obscure uh journal but it was published

581
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,559
by

582
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,240
a laboratory from canada that does all

583
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,720
the testing for lyme disease in the

584
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,279
entire country of canada

585
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,279
canada is different from the us because

586
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,679
they have a national health care system

587
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,840
and so everybody you might say in a

588
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,320
sense everybody has the same doctor and

589
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,960
everybody has the same laboratory so

590
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,840
this laboratory did all the testing for

591
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,320
lyme disease of

592
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,760
from all canadians in the entire country

593
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,240
so so this is a unique study like you

594
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,320
can't you couldn't do it in the us

595
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,200
because

596
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,480
you'd have so many different

597
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,080
laboratories you know you would have to

598
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,480
say oh did i forget this one or did i

599
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,039
include that one but these guys could

600
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,320
include all of canada and you can see

601
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
that oh i should say

602
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,640
if you don't know lyme disease is an

603
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,600
infection it's caused by a bacteria

604
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,000
called aurelia that's the genus name of

605
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,559
the bacteria and you get it from a tick

606
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,880
bite so a tick

607
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,440
who who has the infection but doesn't

608
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,159
get sick the bacteria doesn't bother to

609
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,120
take bites a human and then the human

610
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,559
gets the infection

611
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,039
okay and and i'm sure you've all heard

612
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,880
of lyme disease isn't that isn't that

613
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,320
true okay

614
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,279
so you can see that in canada there's

615
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,279
been a huge increase in the number of

616
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,360
cases of lyme disease

617
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,640
between

618
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,400
2002 and 2015 and this is because canada

619
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,679
got warmer

620
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,520
and what happened was

621
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,720
the ticks

622
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,520
that carry lyme disease in the u.s

623
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,960
they're called exodes i-x-o-d-e-s

624
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,360
these tanks could not live in canada

625
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,000
until about 2002

626
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,760
because it was too cold they would

627
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,520
freeze in the winter

628
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,880
and

629
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,760
there's a mouse what happens is

630
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,279
a mouse also carries the bacteria a tick

631
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,240
bites the mouse and becomes infected and

632
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,880
then the tick bites a human and passes

633
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,000
the infection to the human okay

634
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,400
um so um and the the mouse which is

635
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,880
called the white-footed mouse and it's

636
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,360
scientific name um

637
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,400
oh

638
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,200
let's see what it is i know i have it i

639
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,159
but i forget it

640
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,600
oh it's perimiscus lucopas

641
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,880
the whitefoot mouse it also migrated

642
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,840
into canada as canada got warmer it

643
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,960
didn't it before the year 2000 the mouse

644
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,880
didn't live in canada and now it does

645
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,760
so both the tick and the mouse migrated

646
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,919
to canada and took

647
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,440
uh borrelia with them and now

648
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,279
lyme disease is a disease of canadians

649
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,120
as well as

650
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,239
as americans

651
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,240
okay

652
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,960
now these are just some examples of

653
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,360
infectious diseases that either are

654
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,880
increasing

655
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,279
in numbers because of climate change or

656
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,240
are expected to increase

657
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,679
malaria is everybody knows it's carried

658
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,840
by a mosquito the mosquito is called

659
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,679
anopheles and anopheles is migrating

660
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,240
towards both of the poles as it gets

661
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,120
warmer and it's also going higher up

662
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,240
mountains

663
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,440
and so in africa

664
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,399
they had more efforts to reduce malaria

665
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,279
that failed because the anaphyles

666
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,039
mosquito was able to migrate to higher

667
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,080
areas of africa that were formerly too

668
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,159
cold for

669
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,520
malaria

670
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,200
dengue fever

671
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,000
is a tropical disease carried by a

672
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,159
different mosquito that's called the 80s

673
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,360
mosquito

674
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,320
and

675
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,720
in that the last time there was a study

676
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,039
there was a study published in the

677
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,720
lancet also

678
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,880
in 2016

679
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
and they had data going all the way back

680
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,480
to 1950

681
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,240
and going from 1950 to 2016

682
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,880
the most cases of dengue fever occurred

683
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,720
in 2016.

684
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,320
2016 was the best year for dengue fever

685
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
in the history of the world as far as we

686
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,919
know and it's because the 80s mosquito

687
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,600
is moving north

688
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,080
and moving south away from the equator

689
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,039
and towards the poles and carrying

690
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,480
the virus that causes dengue with it

691
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,520
this last summer

692
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,320
the state of vermont reported

693
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,480
80s mosquitoes in vermont

694
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,600
that had never happened before but uh

695
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,440
the health department of the state of

696
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,279
vermont monitors

697
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,559
uh

698
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,840
uh animals uh that carry diseases and

699
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,399
they discovered 80s mosquitoes in

700
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,840
vermont for the first time

701
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
i i do have

702
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,520
have this list of floods

703
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,960
these are

704
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,880
the

705
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,360
microorganisms that cause

706
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,480
gastrointestinal disorders during a

707
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,399
flood in the united states they're the

708
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,159
most common cause

709
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,799
of flood-related gastrointestinal

710
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,880
disease probably you've heard of some of

711
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,960
them giardia is one is a more common one

712
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,080
uh e coli salmonella campylobacter

713
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,799
you've probably heard of some of those

714
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,279
and norovirus is the virus that causes

715
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,520
all the illness on cruise ships

716
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,760
but it it also causes uh

717
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,600
gastroenteritis during floods

718
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,840
um

719
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,679
okay now

720
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,000
i the next thing i wanted to talk about

721
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,960
is called a toxic bloom and a toxic

722
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,000
bloom is a threat to fresh water uh

723
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,399
toxic blooms have been occurring in lake

724
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,080
erie in the last few years and i think

725
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,520
two years ago

726
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,200
i'm not sure if it was two or three

727
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,120
years ago

728
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,760
the city of cleveland had to stop taking

729
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,760
water out of uh lake erie temporarily

730
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,360
because of a toxic bloom

731
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,679
and what happens a toxic bloom has two

732
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,520
causes a one cause is that the water is

733
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,720
unusually warm and you can see that's

734
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,960
the one related to climate change the

735
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,720
other cause is that

736
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,080
uh nutrients get dumped into the fresh

737
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,360
water and this usually comes from

738
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,760
these are nutrients from manure or from

739
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,159
fertilizer and the nutrients are

740
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,960
phosphorus and nitrogen

741
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,760
and what happens is that microorganisms

742
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,520
grow extremely fast in warm water that's

743
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,159
filled with nutrients and they grow so

744
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,919
fast that they deplete all the oxygen

745
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,880
probably you know this but bacteria

746
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,159
are comfortable without oxygen they can

747
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,840
continue to live whereas most of the

748
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,799
fish

749
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:09,600
and

750
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,559
plants in a lake cannot

751
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,159
so um

752
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,480
so what they do is they kill everything

753
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,840
in the lake

754
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,080
all the living things and they also make

755
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,440
the water

756
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,679
unfit to drink

757
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,159
now this picture comes from a beach in

758
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,559
florida and in florida

759
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,080
when they have uh they have um

760
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,240
toxic blooms but they call them red

761
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,039
tides and if you ever care to do it do a

762
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,360
search on their red tide and you'll come

763
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,000
up with toxic blooms that occur in the

764
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,200
ocean in florida and this is because

765
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,559
uh the

766
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,360
the

767
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,679
government of florida is very casual

768
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,240
about dumping things into the ocean

769
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,559
and so when the ocean water becomes

770
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,840
quite warm they get toxic blooms along

771
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,559
the florida beaches

772
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,200
so toxic blooms are a threat to fresh

773
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,240
water sources

774
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,640
okay now here's a graph of sea level

775
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,480
rise this goes

776
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,080
all the way back uh to the year zero and

777
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,640
i think you can see that in the past

778
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,519
there was virtually no change in sea

779
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,799
level in the world until the 20th

780
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,080
century and then the sea levels start to

781
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,720
rise and of course it's going to rise

782
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,640
quite a bit more than that in the in

783
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,399
this century

784
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,120
and

785
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,039
that's because of

786
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,519
thermal expansion of water and melting

787
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,559
of ice

788
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,120
on land okay

789
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,480
uh

790
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,919
i wanted to show this uh to show you the

791
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,440
idea that that everybody in in the us is

792
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,240
affected by climate change you might not

793
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,360
feel it every day but i'm using this as

794
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,919
an example this is a weather map from

795
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,679
september 15

796
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,440
uh 2020

797
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,240
and and that and and that you may you

798
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,840
might remember

799
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,880
uh

800
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,440
and that was a time when there were lots

801
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,240
of

802
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,960
forest fires in california and oregon

803
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,240
and washington and the brown color shows

804
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,360
the smog or the the smoke particles

805
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,799
moving across the united states from the

806
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,000
uh

807
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,559
from the forest fighters

808
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,120
and then you can also see that there are

809
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,399
two hurricanes one is located pretty

810
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,159
close to new england

811
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,200
and the other one is located um pretty

812
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,080
close to florida and uh

813
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,440
alabama

814
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,760
and um

815
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,200
and so you could see from this map that

816
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,360
uh just about the whole united states

817
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,720
was engulfed in some aspect of climate

818
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,600
change

819
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,000
on that day and of course it's going to

820
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,120
get progressively worse and unless we

821
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,000
take action

822
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,399
this is a study that comes from the

823
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,359
environmental protection agency and it's

824
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,879
a listing of the pollutants that come

825
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,520
from burning fossil fuels

826
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,560
and

827
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,119
the top line shows

828
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,839
the um the uh

829
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,560
amount of carbon dioxide released from

830
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,440
fossil fuel combustion now

831
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,520
there's really three kinds of fossil

832
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,359
fuels coal

833
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,399
oil and gasoline is under oil gasoline

834
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,800
is a derivative of oil

835
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,639
and natural gas

836
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,879
and

837
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,960
this is expressed

838
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,119
this is expressed as

839
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,800
pounds of carbon dioxide per billion btu

840
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,079
of energy

841
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,560
well a btu is called a british thermal

842
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,960
unit it's a a measure of energy that's

843
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,880
used by engineers

844
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,119
i i'm not an engineer and i'm not very

845
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,720
familiar with it but

846
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,440
uh it the the the

847
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,520
the one problem you learned in college

848
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,520
was the jewel you've probably heard of

849
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,960
jewels well a btu is roughly equal to a

850
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,440
thousand joules

851
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,760
so uh when we

852
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,160
burn when we burn fossil fuels we

853
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,359
release

854
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,720
you can see on the first the the top uh

855
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,160
the top row we release carbon dioxide

856
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,960
and

857
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,359
and coal is the worst

858
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,839
oil and gasoline are intermediate and

859
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,040
natural gas is the best but actually we

860
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,880
can't afford any of these we can't

861
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,560
afford to burn any of these fossil fuels

862
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,200
and keep increasing the

863
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,920
concentration of greenhouse gases in the

864
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,000
atmosphere

865
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,640
another thing i wanted to point out is

866
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,640
if you go down to the second line from

867
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,839
the bottom it's called

868
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:00,000
particulates and when we burn fossil

869
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,680
fuels we release soot or smog

870
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,040
into the air

871
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,160
and

872
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,480
some of these particles are extremely

873
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,680
tiny

874
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,359
and they're

875
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,280
they're

876
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,440
inhaled into the lung

877
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,160
and then they're distributed into other

878
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,079
parts of the body

879
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,680
and recent

880
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,079
studies in my own field of pathology

881
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,119
have demonstrated that you can find

882
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,400
tiny soot particles in human brains and

883
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,599
in the heart and in the placenta

884
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,680
and

885
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,240
it's been known for many years that air

886
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,599
pollution is harmful to people but it's

887
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,480
never

888
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,720
always been that clear exactly how it

889
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,720
does harm and so this is a new discovery

890
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,760
and it's a new idea that maybe

891
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,079
when these particles come inside of our

892
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,800
body that they are the cause

893
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,119
of the problems that we have with air

894
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,680
pollution like air pollution makes heart

895
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,960
attacks statistically more common

896
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,640
and now we know from recent discovery

897
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,520
that particles from the from air

898
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,520
pollution are deposited in the heart

899
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,640
and air pollution is associated with

900
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,320
premature birth

901
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,680
and with other problems at birth and now

902
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,640
we know that the placenta has tiny

903
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,640
particles of of air pollution uh and

904
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,520
uh

905
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,839
just this past summer

906
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:34,800
uh

907
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,400
in july

908
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,320
there was an article

909
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,800
from a british group of researchers

910
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,880
saying that there was an association of

911
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,560
statistical association between dementia

912
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,760
alzheimer's disease and air pollution so

913
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,560
that

914
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,200
the the more air pollution a person was

915
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,480
exposed to the the higher their risk of

916
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,480
eventually developing alzheimer's

917
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,880
disease and now we know

918
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,440
more recently that that the brain

919
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,599
actually contains particles from air

920
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,599
pollution and i'm going to just show you

921
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,240
one slide

922
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,079
and

923
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,560
now maybe those of you farther back

924
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,079
aren't going to be able to see this but

925
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,760
this is a a microscopic slide from a

926
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,000
placenta and it's

927
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,720
these green structures are the placental

928
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,440
villi and they're very irregularly

929
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,400
shaped the placental villi

930
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,079
grow into the uterus of the mother and

931
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,280
they are what provides air to the baby

932
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,480
okay so what happens is the placental

933
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,599
villus has a blood vessel and that blood

934
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,640
vessel gets very close to blood vessels

935
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,520
in the mother's uterus and then oxygen

936
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,400
is transferred from the mother's blood

937
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,599
vessel to the baby to the placenta blood

938
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,400
vessel and that's how babies get oxygen

939
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,280
so this is a microscopic slide and the

940
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,640
green part

941
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,440
uh

942
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,880
the green part is the placental villi of

943
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,520
the mother now you could probably see

944
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,320
that there are little white arrows

945
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,200
on

946
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,520
on different parts of the slide are you

947
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,440
able to see that from where you are and

948
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,680
next to those white arrows there's a

949
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,599
little tiny dot

950
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,240
and what that is is it's a dot

951
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,520
of smog or air pollution and the way

952
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,920
it's detected is

953
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,640
you have this green light that is going

954
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,880
through the microscope to show you the

955
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,599
placenta villi but then they took a

956
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,280
laser that is at a 90 degree angle to

957
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,440
the tissue and it's shooting through the

958
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,680
tissue and when there's a

959
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,960
solid particle not it's a solid particle

960
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,760
that's very hard harder the tissue that

961
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,880
then the laser is deflected and it looks

962
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,160
like a white spot okay so even though

963
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,400
we would call it a small black if we

964
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,800
could see it it would be like a brown or

965
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,760
black

966
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,839
it looks white in this preparation

967
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,240
because we're bouncing it's bouncing a

968
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,640
laser off of it okay

969
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,280
another thing i i don't want to go into

970
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,200
too much detail but

971
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,000
a way you can confirm this is

972
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,160
that these products of air pollution

973
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,000
contain iron

974
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,839
you've probably heard or maybe you've

975
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,240
heard that that one of the

976
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,960
things of air pollution is heavy metals

977
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,280
so air pollution sometimes contains

978
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,280
mercury and cadmium and lead and arsenic

979
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,160
but actually the most common metal that

980
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,280
it contains is iron so

981
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,400
you can

982
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,599
there's a

983
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,319
scientist in england developed a very

984
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,400
very sensitive way of measuring

985
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,200
magnetism and she can detect iron in

986
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,599
these slides she can confirm that

987
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,560
there's iron in those particles by

988
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,760
measuring by detecting the magnetism of

989
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,960
the iron

990
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,839
okay

991
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,200
so

992
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,160
all of us are in a sense victims of air

993
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,720
pollution the world health organization

994
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,599
says that four million people each year

995
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,040
die from air pollution and the reason

996
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,880
they die is because they have lung

997
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,240
disease that gets worse like asthma and

998
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,960
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

999
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,760
and also they get cancers like lung

1000
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,560
cancer is associated with air pollution

1001
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,319
and they have a higher risk of heart

1002
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,800
attack and stroke and

1003
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,560
and doing doing statistical modeling the

1004
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,560
world health organization

1005
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,000
says that about 4 million people die

1006
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,480
early deaths each year from air

1007
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,720
pollution mostly these are in most of

1008
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,200
these people are in china and india

1009
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,040
where the air pollution is a lot worse

1010
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,960
than it is here

1011
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
okay now

1012
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,560
this is a study

1013
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,440
from the journal science i'm sure you've

1014
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,200
all heard of the journal science it's

1015
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,760
one of the most well-known science

1016
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,880
journals and and this reference is also

1017
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,640
listed in the handout

1018
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,599
and

1019
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:12,480
um

1020
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
what they did was

1021
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,280
they they wanted to do the statistical

1022
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,400
risk

1023
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,160
uh to

1024
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,440
of people born in different years okay

1025
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,000
so uh in this graph they're looking at

1026
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,400
people born in 1960

1027
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,280
and what is if you're born in 1960 how

1028
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,200
many heat waves are you going to

1029
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,920
experience in your life and they came up

1030
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,480
roughly with the number four now this is

1031
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,200
for the whole world so it's an average

1032
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
over the whole world okay

1033
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,800
now say instead you were born in 2020

1034
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,599
what is your risk of a heat wave well

1035
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,280
this one that says times seven this is

1036
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,680
if the world does nothing about climate

1037
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,839
change and we continue on as we are then

1038
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,200
the person born in 2020 will experience

1039
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,440
seven times more heat waves

1040
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,720
than the person born in 1960 okay now

1041
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,880
the time six this is if we keep warming

1042
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,599
to two degrees centigrade so if we if we

1043
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,880
stop at two degrees centigrade then it's

1044
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,680
six-fold increase in heat waves and if

1045
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,680
we stop at 1.5 degrees centigrade

1046
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,760
i i don't know what maybe they're

1047
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,200
telling me i need to shut up

1048
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,079
if we stop at 1.5 degrees centigrade

1049
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,079
which is recommended by the

1050
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,000
intergovernmental panel on climate

1051
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,040
change then it's a four-fold increase in

1052
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,240
the number of heatwaves

1053
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,400
okay well

1054
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,480
let me stop here again and just see it

1055
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
does it does anybody have any questions

1056
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,560
or comments that they wish to make

1057
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,960
i'm sure the

1058
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,880
insurance companies would like that data

1059
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,839
on

1060
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:11,920
hurricanes you know as policies arise

1061
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,160
yeah yes actually there are several

1062
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,400
insurance companies that are working

1063
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,640
that are working on this and i'm sorry

1064
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,520
i'm not a business person but but

1065
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,000
there's a company that has

1066
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,119
done a whole bunch of work on insurance

1067
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,640
and climate change

1068
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,520
and also there's another company it's

1069
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,640
the name is called jupiter it's

1070
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,440
jupiter.com i believe and what they uh

1071
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,520
do is they

1072
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,640
risk they do risk assessment of property

1073
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,000
for sea level rise and you can hire them

1074
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,240
and and like just say if you're in

1075
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,960
charleston north south carolina you can

1076
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,960
hire them say i'm thinking of buying a

1077
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,839
building in charleston what is my risk

1078
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,560
of flooding and they will tell you they

1079
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,480
will calculate

1080
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,800
the sea level rise in the future and

1081
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,560
give you an estimate of the risk

1082
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,119
okay any other comments or questions

1083
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,720
i'm just going to go to my

1084
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,520
last slide here um

1085
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,240
this is a slide from oxfam

1086
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,000
oxfam you know gives food to poor people

1087
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,560
and and in the in the course of giving

1088
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,079
food to poor people uh they study

1089
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,000
what's happening in the world so that

1090
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,800
they can anticipate problems and this is

1091
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,720
a study that they did

1092
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,280
showing weather related disasters

1093
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,560
compared to

1094
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,760
civil conflict and you can see that

1095
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,119
civil this is before the ukraine war so

1096
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,079
it's it's dated by that but you can see

1097
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,119
that uh the green line is civil conflict

1098
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,520
there's been a small increase

1099
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,640
in

1100
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,599
this is this is measuring how many

1101
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,200
how many people are displaced by

1102
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,800
a disaster so the green line is how many

1103
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,599
people are displaced by war

1104
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,760
and the blue line is how many people are

1105
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,960
displaced by a climate disaster and you

1106
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,000
can see that there's been a big increase

1107
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
in the number of

1108
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,240
displaced persons due to climate

1109
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,440
disasters and and they translated this

1110
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,440
into a statistic that

1111
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,760
that i find helpful they said in 1980

1112
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,079
uh the number of days between

1113
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,240
billion-dollar billion dollar weather

1114
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,480
disasters was 80

1115
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,480
but in

1116
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,720
2016 the number of days between billion

1117
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,400
dollar weather disasters is 18.

1118
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,200
so it's a big change and that is and

1119
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,599
that's climate change so

1120
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,319
that's everything that i wanted to say

1121
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,560
thank you very much for listening and if

1122
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,720
there are any further questions or

1123
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,200
comments

1124
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,440
is there any hope

1125
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,480
yes we have to reduce uh use of fossil

1126
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,880
fuels that's what we have to do in fact

1127
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,440
let me just i do have here this is what

1128
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,640
you can do

1129
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,440
i have a list

1130
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,119
is there anybody who didn't get my card

1131
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,480
if you i have a

1132
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:26,160
i have a card that lists uh websites

1133
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,559
that give really good scientific

1134
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,720
information about climate change if you

1135
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,480
didn't get one come up here after the

1136
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,280
talk and i'll give you one

1137
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,839
okay well let's quit then thank you

1138
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,139
[Music]

1139
