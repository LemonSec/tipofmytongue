2
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:29,238
[Music]

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,920
okay

4
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,839
oh

5
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,680
all right hi i'm joe cicero and my talk

6
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,920
is going to be digi marsack or digital

7
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,840
marketing security

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,600
uh so today i'm going to cover a little

9
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,680
bit about the title um a little bit

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,520
about me just a small amount a little

11
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,280
bit about how the presentation came to

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,080
be

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,600
i'm going to talk about the red flag

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,840
concept and then i'm going to talk about

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,600
digital marketing

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,360
practitioners emails and digital

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,880
marketing practitioners domain ownership

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,799
all right so when i first thought about

19
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,799
this talk um i thought all right i'll

20
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,880
name it marsek so i ran out obviously

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,799
like an i.t uh person

22
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,360
google marsep and what pops up is uh the

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,759
us coast guard uses marsec already for

24
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,280
maritime security so i thought all right

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,840
well that's not a very good uh name

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,240
uh additionally i looked uh i looked at

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,840
a couple other links and i see here this

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,439
company and satan has trademarked marsec

29
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,880
all right i don't know how to get away

30
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,399
with that with the coast guard using it

31
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,960
but i don't want to break any trademarks

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,960
so i probably wouldn't want to use

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,399
marsept

34
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,000
continuing on i thought all right well

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,680
i'm going to be talking about digital

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,320
marketing security so when i googled

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,758
digi marsec there were no hits and due

38
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,520
to the advanced seo optimization of the

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,360
cyphercon con

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,200
if you google use uh duckduckgo put into

41
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,480
yahoo or put in a bing digi marsack the

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,280
first hit is this conference talk so it

43
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,720
really works out from a marketing

44
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
perspective

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,160
all right so for the last four years

46
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,560
i've been a senior security engineer um

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,720
18 years prior to that i was a i.t

48
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,400
security instructor

49
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,760
that's all i'm going to talk about from

50
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,200
my background if you're interested in

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,040
going into the depths of my background

52
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,519
you can go to joecicero.com which will

53
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,840
redirect you to my linkedin page or you

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,000
can snap that qr code which will bring

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
you to joecicero.com which will redirect

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,400
you to my linkedin page

57
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,120
um the talk is only 25 minutes long i

58
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,959
guess there's nobody after me so we can

59
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,400
we can go a little bit longer i don't

60
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,760
think we will i've got it timed out

61
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,680
pretty good it's going to be a machine

62
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,239
gun presentation so i have 30 slides

63
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,000
rather than putting bullets in a slide

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,599
and talking about the bullets every

65
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,959
slide is a bullet that way it's a little

66
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,480
bit bigger for you to see and we can go

67
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,400
through it pretty quickly

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,760
okay so four years ago on my first

69
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,640
second third fourth day of work an email

70
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,680
comes in

71
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,080
user says the security engineering team

72
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,599
should look at this email comes to the

73
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,239
security engineering team the subject

74
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,959
it's a yahoo email address the subject

75
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,400
is urgent reply requested

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,720
the body of the email says i'm sending

77
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,760
this on behalf of someone else please

78
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,120
open up the attachment for the free

79
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,720
evening

80
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
seminar

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,159
like it's got every flag you could

82
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,799
possibly want to say this is a phishing

83
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,799
email well after a little bit of

84
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:51,760
analytic

85
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,599
examination we found out no it was a

86
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,360
legitimate email

87
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,439
and a co-worker and i coined the term

88
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,000
stupid legit i was like this is just

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,879
awful but i started with a marketing

90
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,560
degree and i looked at the marketing

91
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,400
perspective of that and i said boy these

92
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,080
people that are doing this they really

93
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,439
don't know

94
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,560
all of these things so i i started

95
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,879
looking into resources that i could give

96
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,320
my marketing department or other

97
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,478
marketing departments all these things

98
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,399
that they shouldn't do from an i.t

99
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,560
security practitioner's perspective and

100
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,320
there was nothing out there so what

101
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,520
you're going to see today is a

102
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,360
culmination of all that information that

103
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,680
i said time after time after time right

104
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,199
this is a real mistake that these

105
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,639
organizations are making and if they

106
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,160
wouldn't make this mistake they wouldn't

107
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,400
have friction

108
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,360
so

109
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,960
red flag concept if you're an i.t

110
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,400
security practitioner you should be

111
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,639
familiar with the red flag concept the

112
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,280
red flag concept is when something is

113
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,479
amiss something's wrong it's a red flag

114
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,199
now any normal email or any normal

115
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,160
website can have a red flag one may not

116
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,840
be enough for you to say i'm not gonna

117
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,080
i'm gonna i'm not gonna block this but

118
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,680
you start getting more and more red

119
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,759
flags and you start saying all right

120
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,199
something is terribly wrong with this

121
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,720
now i want you to think about the

122
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
environment we're currently in from an

123
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,720
i.t security practitioners

124
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,759
uh a perspective we've got a war going

125
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,520
on with russia and ukraine we've got

126
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,160
tensions with china we've got korea

127
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,479
we've got hacking organizations that

128
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,440
have taken over i'm in healthcare

129
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,199
six months ago 24 hospitals falling for

130
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,560
health care uh related phishing emails

131
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,240
we're on edge

132
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,039
so

133
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,360
red one red flag

134
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,919
from an i.t security practitioner's

135
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,440
standpoint might be enough to block the

136
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,160
marketing practitioner's email or the

137
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,039
marketing practitioner's website so

138
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,639
keep that in mind as we go through these

139
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,919
slides

140
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,440
all right so every slide i'm going to

141
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,800
get into the presentation now and every

142
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,080
slide is going to be broken up into

143
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,680
three sections the top section is what

144
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,039
i'm going to be talking about the

145
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,400
section on the right is going to be a

146
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,600
screenshot of a website that had data

147
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,199
that's backing up what i say so you

148
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,639
don't have to say well joe cicero said

149
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,639
this you could say he provided me with

150
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,759
all of the

151
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,600
criteria on why he was making these

152
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,840
decisions down at the bottom is going to

153
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,080
be the url that will allow you to go to

154
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,000
see that web page so you can say all

155
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,240
right it's 20 years old why am i looking

156
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,600
at this or yeah all right this was from

157
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
2021 and it's recent all right so let's

158
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,080
start the presentation off url

159
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,479
shorteners what is a url shortener for

160
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,160
those if you don't know url shorter

161
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,280
takes a very long url and shortens it

162
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,680
down to something that's memorable that

163
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,440
you can type

164
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,600
why would a marketing practitioner want

165
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,319
to use a url sharpener well it's more

166
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,120
memorable and easy to type

167
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,080
why would a bad guy or a malicious actor

168
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,479
want to use a url shortener

169
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,120
because there's high risk url shorteners

170
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
there on the right-hand side because

171
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,680
when that email comes into the user it

172
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,479
now

173
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,639
doesn't show the actual domain that

174
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,000
you're going to it's going to go to the

175
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
url shortener which is going to redirect

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,639
to some other website

177
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,479
you'll notice number one and number

178
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,720
seven there bitly and uh

179
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,720
tinyurl.com are used a lot well my

180
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
response to this is why are marketing

181
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,319
practitioners using url shorteners when

182
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,199
was the last time you got an email with

183
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,000
a url shortened url and then called

184
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,240
someone up and said let me read you the

185
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,599
url

186
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,080
right the purpose of these is done we

187
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
don't do that you got it in an email

188
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,000
you've got a link to click click the

189
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,039
link

190
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,960
and you don't use the url shortener

191
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,080
besides

192
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
if size matters

193
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,680
the you are long url is better

194
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,520
all right tracking images what are

195
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,919
tracking images so marketers have

196
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,599
learned that you can take a one by one

197
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,440
pixel image and you can put it into an

198
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,880
html based email and when the user opens

199
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,440
up that email you now know the user

200
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,800
opened up that email why is the

201
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
malicious actor like that exactly the

202
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,360
same reason my email got through all of

203
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,520
the security mechanisms it needed to get

204
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,599
to to get to the user

205
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,639
now why is all this data meaningless

206
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,560
well if you are running a secure email

207
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,840
gateway it may have already visited that

208
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,440
link that

209
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,720
that pixel

210
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,479
making the marketing practitioner

211
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,800
believe that the email has been opened

212
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,560
when it has not

213
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,319
yet the email might be going through a

214
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,440
sandbox so the sandbox visits all those

215
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,240
links and so the marketing practitioner

216
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,759
who gets the information back oh someone

217
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,360
opened my email no nobody opens your

218
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,599
email that was a security mechanism that

219
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,839
was visiting that that link and so the

220
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,519
the no one did go to it

221
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,839
and then the third reason is if a user

222
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,800
is not viewing images in the email

223
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,600
they viewed your email but you don't get

224
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,399
alerted to it so the value of a tracking

225
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,839
image is very small it's a red flag for

226
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,399
the ik security practitioner so when you

227
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,320
use it we're looking at and saying is

228
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,800
this legit or not all right so for all

229
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,640
those reasons i would recommend to

230
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,959
marketing practitioners stop using the

231
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,600
tracking pixel or tracking image

232
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,160
all right what's a tracking link

233
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,320
tracking link allows a marketing

234
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,519
practitioner to s they provide you a

235
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,399
link

236
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,480
you get the email that link goes out to

237
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
one website that keeps track of

238
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,320
everything what browser were you using

239
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,800
what user agent were you using an email

240
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,720
what time did this happen

241
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,040
all of the data that marketers love to

242
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,279
get and then it sends you off to the

243
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,600
website

244
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,760
what do the bad guys do well they send

245
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,519
you links and i've seen them go through

246
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,839
eight other links so they'll send you a

247
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,839
link you that link is a legitimate

248
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,920
legitimate site it might be a

249
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,200
google drive it might be uh app.com some

250
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,440
microsoft website and that site

251
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,360
redirects you off to a credential

252
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,839
harvesting site or a malicious website

253
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,760
so the bad guys are doing exactly the

254
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,959
same thing

255
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,040
that's why the marketing practitioner

256
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,519
doesn't want to do this because for all

257
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,959
the reasons i talked about in the

258
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,880
previous slide this isn't going to

259
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
necessarily work for you you're not

260
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,839
going to get data back from the uh the

261
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,320
tracking link

262
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,839
i have a

263
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,959
few users that get marketing materials

264
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,480
every week

265
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,279
and every week they're blocked

266
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,839
and if i have time which i don't have a

267
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,680
lot of i want you to think about it

268
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,240
teams right i might have the time to go

269
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,560
say well i'll review that and then i'll

270
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,000
send it to the person so that they can

271
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,800
get to that otherwise they have to

272
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
create they have to go it gets blocked

273
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,880
they have to create a ticket they have

274
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,959
to that's making a phone call to the

275
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,399
service desk going through all that

276
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,240
process that ticket has to come to me do

277
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,560
you see all the friction here

278
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,279
like the marketing person wanted to get

279
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,519
you somewhere and you're never going to

280
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,200
get there so that's another reason you

281
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,040
want to stay away from the

282
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,880
the tracking links

283
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,000
all right this one i don't understand

284
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
fully

285
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,360
uh why would you get a blank email with

286
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,760
an attachment but it happens

287
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,240
with marketing material a blank email

288
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,720
comes in and the typical user is going

289
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,360
to that's had appropriate training is

290
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,519
going to say i'm not supposed to do this

291
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,920
i got a blank email i have to submit

292
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,600
that to the it security team the

293
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,120
security engineers have to take a look

294
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
at that so then it comes to us and we

295
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,720
have to go through a view and again this

296
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,120
is how much time and friction is this

297
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,440
causing that marketing material uh to

298
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,760
get to you if it's coming through the

299
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,839
i.t security department team

300
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,800
um

301
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
why might this happen there are a few

302
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,959
reasons why it happens legitimately one

303
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:41,920
is

304
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,480
multi-function scanners where you scan a

305
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,279
document and you send to email all right

306
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,279
that doesn't provide any body to the

307
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,279
email so someone gets an email they

308
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,000
don't know why it was a scanned document

309
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,640
another might be a phone what is it text

310
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,040
to email so somebody's using their phone

311
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,720
they're sending an email they send it

312
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,640
off to somebody at a corporation that's

313
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,079
that's looking at things it comes with

314
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,920
an attachment but nobody in the email we

315
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,279
get those all the time where we have to

316
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,040
do an investigation

317
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,399
if you look at the right side of your

318
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,079
screen you'll see no before has done

319
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,519
some research where blank emails often

320
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,760
come before business email compromise

321
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,880
attacks so if you're doing this as the

322
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,040
marketing practitioner understand that

323
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,200
the i.t security guy is going to look

324
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,279
and say i don't know if i want to allow

325
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,399
this creating a lot of friction

326
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,560
okay can spam requirements what are the

327
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,279
canned spam requirements so years and

328
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,079
years ago they the u.s government came

329
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,040
up with legal requirements for

330
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,720
unsolicited

331
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,800
marketing materials

332
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,920
if your email does not meet these

333
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,600
requirements it's categorized as spam

334
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,920
now if you listen closely to what i said

335
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,279
earlier it was uh

336
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,519
unsolicited marketing materials but how

337
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,360
many of you have gotten an email from

338
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,720
somebody

339
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,519
and forgot you requested

340
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,240
that happens all the time

341
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,639
so if you're an i if you're a marketing

342
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,839
practitioner

343
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,360
and you say well i don't have to adhere

344
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,120
to this because i can just send the

345
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,959
email out to these people because they

346
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,639
checked the box on a website that said

347
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,880
yeah i want the marketing materials and

348
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,079
it comes in

349
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,160
and one user submits it to the it

350
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,440
security team

351
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,680
and the security team reviews the email

352
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,800
and says

353
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,920
there's no

354
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,320
conspicuous or straightforward way to

355
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,279
unsubscribe therefore this email is

356
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,440
categorized as spam

357
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,760
then the it security practitioner blocks

358
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,160
it for the entire organization

359
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,480
so even if you had a legitimate email

360
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
that you were sending to somebody who

361
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,399
requested it if they forgot

362
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,480
that they requested it and it does not

363
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,880
meet these requirements your emails will

364
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,480
now be blocked for the entire

365
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,399
organization potentially depends upon

366
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,240
their policies my organization you're

367
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,519
going to get blocked for the whole

368
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,760
organization that's a whole lot of

369
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,240
friction for the marketing department so

370
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,399
you should be aware of the can span act

371
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,959
requirements and my recommendation is no

372
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,800
matter what you're sending and i'm

373
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,040
starting to see people do this you have

374
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,959
the requirements in the email even if

375
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,120
the user requested it you put that in

376
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,560
because you don't want to be blocked for

377
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,959
the entire organization

378
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,519
all right let's get into domains

379
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,480
free and cheap domains top-level domains

380
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,839
are friction they're a red flag for me

381
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,440
in some organizations a lot of these

382
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,880
free domains are just going to be

383
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,720
blocked and i'm amazed that i see

384
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,000
marketers using the free nom domains the

385
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
tkml gacf domains additionally things

386
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,120
like info and xyz that cost the marketer

387
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,600
five dollars instead of a dot-com that

388
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,680
cost them 15

389
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,480
right those are red flags for me they're

390
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,120
cheap and they're used by the bad guys

391
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,240
all the time and i'll look at it in this

392
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,079
environment i'll say i i don't even know

393
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,360
if i want to go there i don't even know

394
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,519
if i have time to research it all right

395
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,000
so you should be aware that cheap and

396
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,639
free domains are a mistake from the

397
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,279
marketing practitioner's standpoint

398
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,519
so here's my freenom uh

399
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,240
uh interface and i thought oh ml is a

400
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,320
lot like mill so i went out and i

401
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,760
registered united statesmarines.ml

402
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,839
anybody got guts enough to go to that

403
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,199
qr no one

404
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,519
all right i gotta freeze

405
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,240
is it working

406
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,959
is it redirecting you no it's not no

407
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,880
that's because it's a free service why

408
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,480
would i expect a free service to work

409
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,480
good catch

410
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,800
all right if if you want to see one work

411
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,279
you can go to digimarc.ml

412
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,120
and that one will actually work but

413
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,839
something's going on on the freedom site

414
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,279
that they won't let you take because i

415
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,600
used to well i originally i originally

416
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
had united states marines.ml united

417
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,480
states navy.ml and i took them all i was

418
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,759
like oh they're all there and they're

419
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,040
all free i'm going to suck them all up

420
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,160
and i'm going to redirect them to my

421
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,320
linkedin page and they lock me out of my

422
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,639
account

423
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,240
all right so something else you should

424
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,079
know from from a marketing perspective

425
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,959
side right free and cheap resellers are

426
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,199
a huge mistake

427
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,639
so uh

428
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,920
you'll look on the right-hand side this

429
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,360
is something i would expect the

430
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,519
marketing department to do we're gonna

431
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,279
register a domain if you're not dealing

432
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,680
with the it department to do this uh go

433
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,680
out and find out which ones are used by

434
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,880
bad people the most and don't use those

435
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,480
so if you see here there's a list on the

436
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,399
right hand side top that's probably top

437
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,880
10 malicious domain registrars the one

438
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,600
that i run into the most is namecheap so

439
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,880
right in the middle that was a different

440
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,800
website a different website provided me

441
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,680
oh yeah namecheap is a bad one uh sure

442
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
you got a cheaper domain but you have to

443
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,959
understand

444
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,880
that's going to cost you from the

445
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,120
perspective of getting that domain

446
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,600
through the it security department to

447
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,759
look at that in use here you'll see

448
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,679
morgan stanley.com legitimate domain

449
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,839
registered spoofed slash lookalike

450
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,720
domain morgan

451
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,720
samly.com i can say right t and the s

452
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,280
reversed and where was that registered

453
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,679
namecheap and on a regular basis when

454
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,520
i'm reviewing websites or trying to

455
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,439
doing my it security work i'm seeing

456
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,799
namecheap and others other cheap free

457
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,200
resellers being used and i'm telling you

458
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,520
from a ig security standpoint to the to

459
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,360
the marketing practitioner that is a

460
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,280
mistake pay the extra ten dollars

461
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,120
all right pre-owned domains this is

462
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,400
something that the marketing

463
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,039
practitioner may not even think about

464
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,799
pre-owned domains

465
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,760
can be a red flag so you're out looking

466
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
for a domain you know all those domain

467
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,039
registrars say just type your domain

468
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,480
here and we'll tell you whether we we

469
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,400
have it and if they don't a lot of times

470
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,160
they'll say hey guess what

471
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,000
we can you can buy that one this stuff

472
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
so i'm in healthcare i'm not with

473
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,360
prevail but preview was very close to

474
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,440
prevail so i wonder what preview how

475
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,039
much per deal cost that's that that's

476
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,919
going to cost you 10 000

477
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,280
uh what might that domain have been

478
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,760
categorized as previously well if you

479
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,200
look here you've got

480
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,000
malicious website shopping advertising

481
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,320
and back to phishing so think about that

482
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,480
you purchase a pre-owned domain the

483
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,080
marketing practitioner may not even

484
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,960
realize that you don't check hey what

485
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,200
has this site been categorized as

486
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,760
previously by the

487
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,559
the

488
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,799
web filtering software that's out there

489
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,480
and all of a sudden you buy a domain

490
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,640
that's been categorized as phishing or

491
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,360
malware is the is the i.t security

492
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,760
practitioner going to let that through

493
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,919
probably not you're done you're done in

494
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,720
a wood so so think about that if you're

495
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,039
considering buying a pre-owned domain it

496
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,559
might be already categorized as

497
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,960
something which would cause friction

498
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,480
all right 10 years ago i would have

499
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,080
changed my answer on this but now that

500
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,840
i'm on the blue team

501
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,000
things change so who is data for those

502
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,600
of you that don't know who who is data

503
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,679
is when you purchase a domain you can

504
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,520
register it under your name or you can

505
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,760
check a box that says hide all my data

506
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,600
and 10 years ago 15 years ago i would

507
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,799
say i don't know you check that box you

508
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,720
don't want any of that out there well on

509
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,760
the blue team side i want to see a

510
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,480
corporate entity that owns a domain now

511
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,160
why does that happen

512
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,919
you have a primary domain and then you

513
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,360
have somebody for marketing that's going

514
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,520
to buy up a bunch of other domains

515
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,039
except they don't register them with the

516
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,240
same company

517
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,919
they don't so they have a different

518
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,559
registrar or they put different data in

519
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,559
there and now i have a hard time

520
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,080
understanding whether or not is this

521
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,960
really owned by this company or not so

522
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
you want to be consistent with

523
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,200
purchasing these things and you and it's

524
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,600
a it's a best practice for you to have

525
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,559
your domain registrar information go to

526
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,280
a corporate entity

527
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,799
all right this is another thing that i

528
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,240
would not expect a marketing

529
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,919
practitioner to know

530
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,320
newly registered and newly observed

531
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,679
domains

532
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,520
by best practice are blocked so you're

533
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,880
thinking about doing this marketing

534
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,480
campaign ooh let's go out and buy a

535
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,160
domain and i've seen

536
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,039
examples where where employees buy the

537
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,200
domain another department buys the

538
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,720
domain

539
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,919
they don't think about any of these

540
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,440
things and then they just redirect it

541
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,280
where they want to redirect it and i've

542
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,080
seen malicious actors do the same thing

543
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,200
so they do that and now all of that work

544
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,280
that they've done goes nowhere because

545
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,840
that domain is newly registered or newly

546
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,919
observed and it's blocked

547
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,679
in my organization we would pick up on

548
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,960
that right away right it would be a

549
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,200
block website what is this it's it's us

550
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,880
it's a spoof lookalike now i have to

551
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,320
make phone calls find out where did this

552
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,720
come from who owns this what is going on

553
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,679
here so other organizations that's not

554
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,600
going to happen right in my organization

555
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,440
that's easy i'm dealing with my people

556
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,600
but if your organization has done that

557
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,799
i'm going to look at that website and

558
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,559
say no this is not right something's

559
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,280
wrong here and again you have the

560
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,039
friction that you don't want as the

561
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,840
marketing practitioner

562
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,159
okay hosting companies now i'm getting a

563
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,280
little uh uh uh picky here but the

564
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,840
hosting company use where you put the

565
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,480
website what server you put the website

566
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,840
on that company

567
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,480
may be a red flag there is if you look

568
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
off to the right there is the top 10

569
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,200
malicious uh hosting companies

570
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,120
so another thing the marketing

571
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,720
practitioner wants to do is say where

572
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,520
are we hosting this and is this website

573
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,000
one of those that or is this hosting

574
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,159
provider one on this list or are they

575
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,400
are they on a list anywhere it would be

576
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,760
advantageous to not use hosting domains

577
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,520
that would be categorized by the i.t

578
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,880
security practitioner as a red flag

579
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,000
okay hosting ip this is a biggie so if

580
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,600
you're going to communicate you're going

581
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,360
to do hosting you've decided on a

582
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,600
hosting company one of the questions

583
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,200
that you absolutely want to ask them is

584
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,120
what is your ip space

585
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,840
because you can be blocked your the i.t

586
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,679
security practitioner can block a

587
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,480
website based upon domain name

588
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,120
and based upon ip address

589
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,200
and the software we use may do that

590
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
right it may be that i haven't i haven't

591
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,520
purposefully done that but some product

592
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,159
i'm using says uh malicious ip i'm going

593
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,760
to block that or malicious domain i'm

594
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,159
going to block that two different things

595
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,200
if you go purchase a website and they

596
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,360
put you on the same ip address with

597
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,600
hundreds of other malicious sites what

598
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,280
are the odds that the i.t security

599
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,559
practitioner is going to say yeah i'll

600
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,480
go ahead and open that up it's there

601
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,320
with 100 other malicious sites and i

602
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,159
have seen that i have seen where we have

603
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,559
one legitimate site and there's a

604
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,280
thousand websites on the same ip address

605
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,679
and hundreds of them were registered by

606
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,039
somebody that was malicious and they

607
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,360
have malware on them there's no way i'm

608
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,600
opening up your site to that that's the

609
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,360
friction you have to worry about so

610
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,080
domain hosting ip

611
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,360
new

612
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,720
as of a month ago so uh we got an alert

613
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,600
i think it was a cisa alert that csu.gov

614
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,799
saying you know what uh due to current

615
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,440
environments in russia and ukraine you

616
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,159
may want to geo-block

617
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,000
these countries

618
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,039
so while you probably are not hosting a

619
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,559
website in

620
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,640
ukraine and russia

621
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,200
unless you're ukrainian or russian

622
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,960
uh you're probably not a us company

623
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,600
doing that you might be hosting it

624
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,000
overseas somewhere and an organization

625
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,600
in the united states has said you know

626
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,559
what we're we're so afraid of this that

627
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,960
we're going to geofence to united states

628
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,159
based ips or u.s and canada-based ivs so

629
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,480
it's another consideration as a

630
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,360
marketing practitioner you have to have

631
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,640
to say okay

632
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,720
i don't think i want to i think this

633
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,159
hosting company is in the u.s we're

634
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,960
going to deal with uh u.s i'm sorry u.s

635
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,520
based hosting uh companies

636
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,600
and ips

637
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,760
all right the cms this is getting really

638
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,919
picky but i have a story we don't

639
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,520
remember these presentations we remember

640
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,600
the stories in the presentation so the

641
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,880
cms

642
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,960
the the content management system that

643
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,760
you decide to use for your marketing

644
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,880
website

645
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,279
can be a red flag

646
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,000
i had an organization or i had a user

647
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,400
contact me this website is blocked

648
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,240
i take a look at the website like all

649
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,840
right let's go over to virustotal oh

650
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,520
yeah firestone's got four or five things

651
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,360
that are saying it was a bad website a

652
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,520
little more research and i find the

653
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,960
exact links that had the malware on them

654
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,880
testing those links they don't exist

655
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,559
anymore they've been cleaned up they're

656
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,679
gone

657
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,200
however the website is a wordpress site

658
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,520
it was probably a hacked wordpress site

659
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,960
when one of the vulnerabilities for

660
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,840
wordpress came out but last week a new

661
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,559
wordpress vulnerability came out

662
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,159
what are the odds they're not patched

663
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,000
for that one

664
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,840
like that's up there

665
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,080
so what do i do as the i.t security

666
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,600
practitioner do i gamble and say oh it's

667
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
probably clean

668
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,120
i'll get fired

669
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,919
right so the marketing person has to

670
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,840
understand that if you're going to have

671
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,400
a website and it's going to be drupal or

672
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,880
wordpress or whatever that that website

673
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,120
has to stay up to date and it cannot get

674
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,279
hacked because the minute it gets hacked

675
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,039
you're going to start being on a list

676
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,440
and when you're on a list for me i can't

677
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,960
risk it

678
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
so think about those things when you're

679
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,720
when you're deciding on what cms you

680
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,320
want to use

681
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,480
all right https tls certificates so uh

682
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,400
let's encrypt was a good idea from a

683
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,200
privacy perspective but from a blue team

684
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,360
guy not so much as a security

685
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,400
perspective when i see a let's encrypt

686
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,480
certificate i naturally think

687
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,720
i don't it's a red flag now it might not

688
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
be a red flag that stops you

689
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,039
cold but that combined with other red

690
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,440
flags your website may not be getting

691
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,360
unblocked

692
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,039
in a little bit i'm going to talk about

693
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,679
uh uh actually it's this next slide so

694
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,039
https redirection

695
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,760
so i've run into organizations if you

696
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,919
want to do something cool go to

697
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,799
dnstwister.report

698
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,240
and put in the domain bank of america

699
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,080
what

700
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,679
dnstwister.report will do is show you

701
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,960
all of the iterations all of the spoofed

702
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,679
slash lookalike domains for bank of

703
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:28,799
america

704
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,640
and it'll tell you whether or not email

705
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,720
has been registered for that domain and

706
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,080
whether or not that domain is up and

707
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,080
running so that doesn't even exist right

708
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,919
it can twist it see is there something

709
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,679
out there with that name and show you

710
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,720
that so

711
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,279
so https redirection

712
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,159
if you buy a vanity domain

713
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,600
and a lot of companies will do this oh

714
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,799
we'll just buy that domain

715
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,679
junk dot healthcare i'll buy jump down

716
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,559
healthcare and i'll redirect it uh i'll

717
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,720
only buy it for this little reason and

718
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,679
then i'll redirect it back to my website

719
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,080
well that redirection

720
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,080
may not be in a secure manner if

721
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,640
somebody goes to jump down healthcare

722
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,679
that's going to be via port 80

723
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,400
and then it's going to redirect to your

724
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,760
secure website that's called uh uh it

725
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,240
instantly

726
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,919
am i in the right place insecure yeah

727
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,279
insecure that's called insecure

728
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,440
redirection so it will not redirect in a

729
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,880
secure manner

730
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,039
what then happens is you get yours your

731
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,000
cyber security score reduced for those

732
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,120
of you not familiar there's two

733
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,400
companies out there that are primary

734
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,159
companies one's bitsight the other

735
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,880
security scorecard for your organization

736
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,679
they will keep your security score well

737
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,400
that security score can be used by your

738
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,960
cyber insurance to decide how much

739
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,840
you're going to pay this year and cyber

740
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,760
insurance this year for many

741
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,039
organizations has increased 50 to 500

742
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,320
percent

743
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,039
so

744
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,120
the marketing department does something

745
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,440
that's going to cost the organization a

746
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,679
lot of money think about that https

747
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,120
redirection i have a slide in two more

748
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,039
slides that's going to cover a lot of

749
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,360
settings that you have to think about

750
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,200
all right website contents another thing

751
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
i want the marketing practitioners to

752
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
know is that before you set up the

753
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,080
website you should go and review scam

754
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,159
site red flags

755
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,640
one of our red flags if we go to a

756
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,279
website is is the contact page using a

757
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,919
free email service and i can't believe

758
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,960
how many are right you go to the domain

759
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,120
and then you click on a contact page and

760
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,080
it's a gmail account or a yahoo account

761
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,559
like that's a huge red flag is this site

762
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,159
legit or not

763
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,679
and we're trying to do things at the

764
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,679
speed of light right we need to get this

765
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,200
fixed so that we get on to the next

766
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,799
issue so

767
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,039
i highly recommend if you're setting up

768
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,200
a marketing website that you are aware

769
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,159
of what the scam sites use as

770
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,240
documentation for whether or not you

771
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,840
would be considered a scam site uh

772
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,760
free email services the contact is one

773
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,600
of the huge ones

774
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,120
all right so these are some of the

775
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,720
settings if you know i don't expect you

776
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,919
to see them and read them and i'm not

777
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,200
going to go through them all i only have

778
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,799
so much time uh uh but that bit site and

779
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,640
security scorecard these are the

780
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,480
settings that they will keep track of

781
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,640
that will look some of them that will

782
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,880
lower your score and cost your

783
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,960
organization more money from a i.t cyber

784
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,200
insurance perspective so you should the

785
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,480
marketing department should be aware

786
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,000
that and work with the id security

787
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,320
department to make sure that

788
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,240
you're getting the best grade that you

789
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,200
can get from these companies

790
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,279
okay holding releasing a domain i think

791
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,039
this is one of my last slides

792
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,320
so

793
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,000
i i

794
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,559
if you buy up these domains these vanity

795
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,919
domains

796
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:50,720
and

797
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,559
you create all kinds of links that go

798
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,880
back to them people create favorites on

799
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,919
them

800
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,840
and there and this campaign is working

801
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,320
great and then the campaign ends

802
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,880
and you release the domain

803
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,440
the domain can be picked up by a

804
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,039
malicious actor

805
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,760
for multiple purposes one is if you add

806
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,840
email to that domain they will be

807
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,159
picking up any emails because now it's

808
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,440
going to them

809
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,120
and the second is they can redirect

810
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,559
anybody going to those domains to

811
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,559
malicious sites

812
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,440
so

813
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,080
my recommendation is don't redirect the

814
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,799
domain back to your primary domain

815
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,080
redirect it to a part domain for several

816
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,960
years

817
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,440
yeah it's going to cost you 15 a year or

818
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,760
whatever it costs to keep a domain for

819
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,840
another couple of years but

820
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,279
your your

821
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,960
brand is not now going to be used

822
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,679
against you or against your clientele or

823
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,120
against somebody who google something

824
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,679
sees your brand in a link clicks on it

825
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,760
and now ends up on a malicious web page

826
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,480
so i highly recommend the domains you

827
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,600
own you develop a process that will

828
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,600
enable you to decommission that domain

829
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,080
redirect it to a domain park page it is

830
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,880
