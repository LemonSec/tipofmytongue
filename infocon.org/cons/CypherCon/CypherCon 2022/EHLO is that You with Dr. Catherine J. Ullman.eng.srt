00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,560
to hear what i have to say

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,320

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,560
you as a group and

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,560
i really do want to hear hear your

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,680
thoughts

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,840
um so this

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,320
talk is uh e flow and we'll talk about

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,840
what that is

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,400
and is that you

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,560
so this is a little bit about me

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,360
um i've done security for a fairly long

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,040
time i've been with the university at

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,520
buffalo um in my current role since

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,520
about 2009

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,200
but i've been with the university 22

29
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,079
years

30
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,799
so i started out in a tech support sort

31
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,600
of role um doing server and workstation

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,159
support and then started part-time doing

33
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,759
forensic stuff

34
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,439
and then moved full-time

35
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,200
into security so that's kind of where i

36
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,680
come from i do a lot of things i'm

37
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,840
involved in a lot of places

38
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,800
um so and i just like to just show off

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,680
my adopted sloth who's the little guy

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,959
you see there

41
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,440
his name is flash and he is at the local

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,040
buffalo zoo um i i adopt him and help

43
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,280
pay for his food and whatnot every year

44
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
so this is what we're going to cover um

45
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,000
and as i was telling a couple folks who

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,680
came up earlier

47
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,519
i give this talk because a lot of folks

48
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,080
are involved in security and may never

49
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,680
have heard anything about the history of

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,239
email and don't realize why it's kind of

51
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,800
a mess that it is right we all know

52
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,280
that email is problematic

53
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,840
you know any time you hear about things

54
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,640
like

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,160
apg we hear the scary ept right

56
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,239
most of the time attackers are starting

57
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,959
out with a phishing message

58
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,400
i mean that's just the nature of it

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,440
right so

60
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,159
you know especially in my role i do a

61
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,959
little bit of a lot of things dfir is my

62
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,080
specialty

63
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,560
um but i do tons of other stuff i do

64
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,879
awareness training and part of this talk

65
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,440
actually comes from awareness training

66
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,040
that i give to end users because

67
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,400
they don't understand the nature of

68
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,680
email any more than tech folks do so um

69
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,680
so these are the sort of overall topics

70
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,360
we're going to cover so we'll talk a

71
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,200
little bit about the history we're going

72
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
to talk about something called the

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,480
envelope versus the header

74
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,879
you never see the envelope people think

75
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,480
you see the envelope but unless you're a

76
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,120
command line you never actually see that

77
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,400
and they confuse it with the header all

78
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
the time and we're going to talk about

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,599
how the client and the server actually

80
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,720
communicate and we'll see why eclo

81
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,000
or hello

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,840
is literally how that conversation

83
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,120
begins

84
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,959
we'll talk about how you read an email

85
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,480
header

86
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,280
which

87
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,840
a lot of folks who are even do a lot of

88
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,239
advanced things may never have learned

89
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,159
but i'll tell you right now that one of

90
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,799
the very first security things i've been

91
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,799
asked and i've been asked since this you

92
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,799
know since long before i was in my my

93
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,040
current security role i was asked this

94
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,560
question

95
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,000
how do i know if this email is

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,199
legitimate

97
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,639
how many of you have ever gotten that

98
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,040
question

99
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,040
right did you know how to answer it for

100
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,000
sure

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
sometimes i bet right sometimes you look

102
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,680
at it and you're like oh yeah this is

103
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,440
garbage

104
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,120
but do you know

105
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,600
how to dig into it enough to know where

106
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,919
that message actually originated

107
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,759
i mean some of you probably do somebody

108
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,479
i'm seeing like this right

109
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,160
and so uh i i can tell you that

110
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,360
you may not 100 know because

111
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,280
clients can mess with

112
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,199
those headers and you can and and there

113
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,440
are ways that attackers can tinker with

114
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,919
them but we'll we'll go over sort of the

115
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,840
general way you break down the header

116
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,120
and how you figure out where mail

117
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,280
originated and what you can look for

118
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,320
um we'll also talk about all right let's

119
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,800
say you find out this email is garbage

120
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,120
and it's coming from somewhere now what

121
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,720
do i do with it i mean you can certainly

122
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,639
tell the user all right just delete it

123
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,320
that that's a good thing

124
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,919
but what if it's an account that's

125
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,759
constantly sending you crap do you want

126
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,039
to do something with it do you want to

127
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,199
report it how about if it has a phishing

128
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,960
url do you want to do something with

129
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,440
that i know as a support person that

130
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,039
used to frustrate the crap out of me i'd

131
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,320
be like yeah this is garbage and they'd

132
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
be like well now what i know i don't

133
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,199
know

134
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,440
right so we'll talk a little about about

135
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,280
reporting um

136
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,720
i will tell you there is no like cut and

137
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,120
dry way to do any of this stuff there's

138
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,280
some sort of basic

139
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,360
tips and tricks you have to to go

140
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,919
through uh and and i apologize we have

141
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,639
you know the band playing on so if you

142
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,479
need me to ever repeat something just

143
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,639
just let me know um we're also going to

144
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,600
talk about some advanced ideas spfd ken

145
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,800
and dmarc which are the only actual

146
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,639
security things that have ever been

147
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,319
added to email and they were fairly

148
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,360
recent

149
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,800
and we'll talk about some useful tools

150
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,880
things you can do to look up stuff and

151
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,639
find out some of the details you need to

152
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,479
know to both know where this mail

153
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,000
message originated and how to report it

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,759
so e hello

155
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,759
all right how many people know what this

156
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,240

163
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,080
younger than i am

164
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,960

really young and i'm like no no you

169
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,840
don't understand that is

170
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,360
and they go what

171
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,440
and i say yeah i had my first email

172
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,960
account in 1978 and that is because my

173
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,280
father's director of computing services

174
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,759
at the college where i grew up

175
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,800
so

176
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,199
a lot of what's weird about this even

177
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,840
though this predates me a lot of this

178
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,960
takes me

179
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,639
to where i start getting involved with

180
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,680
computing

181
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,639
so the first email box is not like email

182
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,080
we think of today you don't send a

183
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,599
message and receive it in a different

184
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,800
system

185
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,120
it was an application where you send a

186
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,160
message and it was received by another

187
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,919
user of the same machine

188
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,759
so that was that sort of initial

189
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,440
inception email it was you know i leave

190
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,599
a message for you and you pick it up

191
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,680
because you had people just time sharing

192
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,599
on a single terminal and that's how that

193
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,960
worked

194
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,919
um

195
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,120
the first

196
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,479
email in a network was arpanet

197
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,599
and arpanet was kind of the beginning of

198
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,280
what we sort of traditionally think of

199
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,759
as the internet and that graphic that

200
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,599
you see in the corner is the beginnings

201
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,919
of arpanet and how it starts to grow

202
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,639
and arpanet starts to tie into a bunch

203
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,840
of schools

204
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,479
now the the origins of the internet if

205
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,479
you're not familiar starts essentially

206
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,240
with a bunch of colleges it's four

207
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,400
schools that decide

208
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,520
they want their computing stuff to

209
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,039
essentially have a backup in some

210
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,800
capacity and that's why we have these

211
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
four nodes that all kind of support each

212
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,360
other

213
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,400
um and they had no concept of the fact

214
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,160
that this would grow into the thing that

215
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,639
it is today if you told any of the folks

216
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,160
that worked on any of this original

217
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,360
technology

218
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,639
that we're doing what we're doing with

219
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,319
it now they would have been like what

220
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,919
are you out of your mind like who the

221
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,199
heck thought of that

222
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,599
and that's important to understand

223
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,958
because

224
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,240
we'll see why

225
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,839
there's no security in email right

226
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,760
i'm guessing most of you know that but

227
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,159
how many of you didn't know that

228
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,560
anybody not know that

229
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,360
okay

230
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,320
um

231
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,640
i'm always surprised i find people that

232
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,160
are like oh no

233
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,800
like i have secure email i'm like yeah

234
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,760
okay you have secure email if and only

235
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,560
if

236
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,800
it's essentially a closed system so if

237
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,320
your if your doctor's office has a

238
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,160
portal and you send a message through

239
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,839
the portal it never actually leaves the

240
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,240
portal it usually sends you some sort of

241
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,120
out

242
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,880
outside message that says hey you have a

243
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,760
message in a portable chat right

244
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,880
but by its nature email is not secure

245
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,720
so the very first

246
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,480
email that we see

247
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,000
that looks like what we think of his

248
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,680
email doesn't come along until 1971.

249
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,720
and then

250
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,880
the original rfcs

251
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,720
um

252
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,560
we get these add-ons

253
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,760
so we have the original rfc and then we

254
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,519
have um

255
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,760
these other ones

256
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,519
that

257
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,920
get added on so we can see these changes

258
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,640
so this this current one

259
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,519
52 or 5321

260
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,760
is what actually spells out some of the

261
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,160
things that we'll see later like dkim

262
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,320
and dmarc and these editions but it's

263
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,600
been around a really long time

264
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,519
all right so how does an email message

265
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,279
get from place to place

266
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,519
well it uses dns

267
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,720
and of course the joke is what

268
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,040
it's always dns when something breaks

269
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,720
it's always dns right

270
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,920
and for those of you who've never heard

271
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,480
that joke trust me it's true

272
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,279
because without dns networks just fall

273
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,480
down

274
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,440
we had a an issue in the not too

275
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,760
distant past where our firewall stopped

276
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,839
sending traffic outside of our network

277
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,839
and it basically caused our internal dns

278
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,000
service to fall over and then everything

279
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,800
stopped cold so it you know yes in that

280
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,720
case it was technically the firewall but

281
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,040
really was all dns because even

282
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,519
even getting

283
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,920
track inside we could talk to each other

284
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,519
it was crazy

285
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,000
so dns plays a really pivotal role in

286
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
email because

287
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,240
you have these three records these ns

288
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,399
records and that's going to tell you

289
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,880
more domain information

290
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,839
so

291
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:56,959
um

292
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,880
your your basic ns record is going to

293
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,720
tell you uh

294
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,760
what

295
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,920
host names can tell you more

296
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,000
so for example mx records which have to

297
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,320
do with email or a records are sort of

298
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,240
your basic

299
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,200
record of note right so

300
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,760
the mx record is critical here

301
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,640
if your mail system is set up right

302
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,720
your mx records say these are the host

303
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,000
names

304
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,320
that should accept mail

305
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,920
for your domain

306
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,640
and nothing else now

307
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,440
the a record has the ips addresses

308
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,839
associated with with the hosts as well

309
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,839
and and we'll see that ultimately you

310
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,760
can if it doesn't have an mx record it's

311
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,519
just going to go to mit

312
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,399
but i'm guessing this makes sense so far

313
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,000
okay this is pretty basic stuff in the

314
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,360
beginning

315
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,160
so

316
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,240
when you send email this is how dns

317
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,959
plays that role right it's going to say

318
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,320
all right

319
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,240
need some kind of client need a way to

320
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,519
communicate i want to send mail to user

321
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,519
example.com

322
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,240
so

323
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,440
i need to know where the heck is

324
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,120
example.com i have no idea so i'm gonna

325
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,040
i'm gonna look up that ns record and i'm

326
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,320
gonna find out

327
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,839
and then once i know the ns record now i

328
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,279
need to know about those mail servers so

329
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,680
i'm going to ask for the mx record from

330
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,160
where i got the ns record

331
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,000
then i'm going to get the a record to do

332
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,880
the translation for the domain

333
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,160
and this is the part i was talking about

334
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,440
a minute ago

335
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,279
if there's no direct

336
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,120
mx record

337
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,880
but there's an a record to just that ip

338
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,720
address it'll just use that instead

339
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,560
all right

340
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,240
this is an important concept to

341
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,000
understand this is how

342
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,720
some attackers will attack you

343
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,880
this was a much much bigger problem in

344
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,560
the 90s and we still see this as a

345
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,959
problem especially in other countries

346
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,440
we still see it occasionally here but

347
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,040
more often than not we see these other

348
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,959
countries and that's an open mail relay

349
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,839
so

350
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,200
what did i say

351
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
about

352
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,360
email the the first thing we're doing is

353
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,880
we're finding out what the domain is

354
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,720
right and then we're finding out bmx

355
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,440
record what mail systems accept mail

356
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
those are the only systems that should

357
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,399
be accepting mail for your domain end of

358
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,959
subject however an open relay says mail

359
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:21,920
yay

360
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,160
i don't care if it's for me i'm just

361
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,880
gonna relay it along right

362
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,680
so attackers will use them to basically

363
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,320
bypass the rules and send it on its very

364
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,920
way it doesn't care if it's supposed to

365
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,519
get that mail or not

366
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,320
so

367
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,800
the the what they should accept as you

368
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,480
can see on the bottom there

369
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,600
so

370
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,639
they say messages from anybody

371
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,600
to a user in our organization's domain

372
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,279
so if our organization is you know

373
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,839
buffalo.edu

374
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:52,720
then

375
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,399
you know we can get mail from anywhere

376
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,240
as long as it's a valid user in our

377
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,440
domain

378
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,560
and we can accept messages from a valid

379
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,959
user in our domain to a user in any

380
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,959
other domain because we can send out and

381
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,120
that's it this is how it's supposed to

382
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,680
work but open relays will accept it from

383
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,440
anywhere

384
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,040
all right

385
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,560
envelope and header

386
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,320
who has ever seen this distinction

387
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,639
before

388
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
i've seen a couple yeses

389
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,320
a few no's

390
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,160
all right

391
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,920
the reason this is important as i

392
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,839
mentioned briefly earlier

393
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,839
is that the

394
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,360
envelope only happens when the message

395
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,760
is created you never see this this is

396
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,519
not the client this is not outlook this

397
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,959
is not thunderbird

398
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,600
this is not your gmail you know online

399
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,720
client

400
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,560
this is the conversation that

401
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,279
effectively happens between your client

402
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,880
and the server that is when this

403
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,120
information gets created

404
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,000
and if you do this at a command line

405
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,320
then you get to see the envelope and

406
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,399
that is the only way you will see the

407
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,480
envelope unless of course i suppose if

408
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,079
you are capturing the network traffic

409
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,000
right you might see this this data but

410
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,680
generally speaking you're not going to

411
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,199
see this because that's

412
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,040
this is how it takes place

413
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,160
so when smtp the protocol actually sends

414
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,199
mail

415
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,120
it it throws this away that's why you

416
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,320
don't see it

417
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,120
so

418
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,320
um what it includes is the mail from

419
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,920
which is the sender

420
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,959
and the receipt 2 which is the recipient

421
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,760
and all this does is it routes mail from

422
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,760
point a to point b

423
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,800
this is not

424
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,639
what you see in the to and from the mail

425
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,040
message

426
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,600
i'll say that again this is not what you

427
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,079
see in a mail message because we don't

428
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,000
see the envelope

429
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,560
if you do this at a command line

430
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,320
you effectively tell it into port 25

431
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
and you have the same conversation with

432
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,720
a server from the command line that your

433
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,440
mail client does and that is where you

434
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,079
specify you actually type

435
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,320
the mail from business and receipt too

436
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,839
because you actually have to tell the

437
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,639
server the message is from

438
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,160
the server you know here's who i'm

439
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,600
sending it to

440
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,480
and that my friends is where

441
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,160
spoofing makes

442
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,120
really easy work of this because at the

443
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,320
end of the day

444
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,079
the server goes okay

445
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,040
there's

446
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,160
nothing in there to stop it from

447
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,320
accepting that information because

448
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,399
port 25 is open that's how i accept

449
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,880
email right but there's supposed to be a

450
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,920
check

451
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,440
against this

452
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,639
stuff

453
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,920
going on

454
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,600
if it's configured right so it doesn't

455
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,680
just relay it it should say oh

456
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,720
this mail message is for somebody at

457
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,720
fredonia.edu or google.com

458
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,800
i don't accept now for that

459
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,880
and drop it

460
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,639
but that's not what happens in that case

461
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,920
so again

462
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,120
not visible users very easy to forge the

463
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,360
headers on the other hand are actually

464
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,399
inside the message and they get written

465
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,480
as this conversation is going from

466
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,240
server to server to server

467
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,319
so as mail and we're going to see an

468
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,799
example of this as mail is transferring

469
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,439
from one system to another

470
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,119
additional lines get written to the

471
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,240
headers

472
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,039
now

473
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,000
you can monkey with and four cheddars

474
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,679
that is a thing

475
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,480
it takes extra work to do that

476
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,919
most criminals

477
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,039
do not enjoy doing extra work so they're

478
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,039
gonna go the easy route right so they're

479
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,720
going to forge the envelope in some

480
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,080
capacity they're going to use an

481
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,960
application or some mechanism to do that

482
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
they're not going to forge the headers

483
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,120
and they're going to forge the data so

484
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,360
we'll see that in a second because the

485
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,120
stuff that you see in that mail message

486
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
the two line of the from line

487
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,600
that's all data that's not the envelope

488
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,360
and that's not the headers

489
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,720
and this is where people get very

490
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,960
confused usually because they make an

491
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,919
assumption that to from is like because

492
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,799
what do we often equate email to

493
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,720
in our day-to-day lives to people who

494
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,600
don't understand tech

495
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,600
regular us postal mail right

496
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,240
and what is the thing we send us postal

497
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,880
mail in

498
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,200
envelope an envelope right and if we're

499
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,880
sending it through an envelope then we

500
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,160
think okay

501
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,400
if we're making this parallel then the

502
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,039
envelope is the stuff and we can see it

503
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,160
except that's not how that works in

504
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,480
email

505
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,760
all right

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,679
the dubious from field this is what i

508
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,799
use with

509
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,559
again with end users all the time to

510
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,559
explain to them that just because you

511
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,679
see

512
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,039
from doesn't mean that's who it's from

513
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,280
and people say what

514
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
what do you mean

515
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,240
and here's where i see it where it

516
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,320
freaks them out the most

517
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,799
the mail message came from me and it

518
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,840
says really bad

519
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,480
things

520
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,160
how many people have seen examples of

521
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
that so far

522
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,280
sextortion scams at least a few of you

523
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,799
yeah i get

524
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,679
calls pretty regularly or emails or you

525
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,880
know whatever

526
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,760
um

527
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,400
oh my god i just got this email message

528
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,520
it looks like it comes for me

529
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,640
and it says i've been doing bad horrible

530
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,120
things and you know send bitcoin to this

531
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,559
address and i don't know what i'm doing

532
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,640
you know they're terrified

533
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,559
well it is certainly possible their

534
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,960
mailbox is compromised

535
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,919
or

536
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,919
it could in fact just be

537
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,760
someone spoofing their name

538
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
right because

539
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,840
the two and the from are what

540
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,280
what

541
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,620
what

542
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,960
[Music]

543
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,559
well they're arbitrary but they're part

544
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,160
of data

545
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
they're not part of the envelope and

546
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,000
they're not part of the header the part

547
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,320
that you're seeing in that map client is

548
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,799
neither of those two things

549
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,679
it's just data and we'll see you'll

550
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,120
you'll you'll get this in a second

551
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,080
because i'm going to show you a graphic

552
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,559
that'll make that pretty obvious

553
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,400
this is the graphic

554
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,960
this my friends is how email works if

555
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,360
you've never seen this before

556
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,919
[Music]

557
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,159
depending on the particulars of your

558
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,640
mail server or your mail client it is a

559
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,200
conversation that either starts with

560
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,960
e-flo

561
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,760
or

562
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,600
hello

563
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,559
and it's literally like hey i have some

564
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,240
to send you

565
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,000
so in this case

566
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,130
hi i have an email for example.com

567
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,200
[Music]

568
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,640
so hello

569
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,290
smtp.example.com

570
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,679
[Music]

571
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,880
and the server returns that 250 code

572
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,760
which says effectively hey i can process

573
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,240
mail for example.com

574
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,159
now where did we see that

575
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,320
well we saw that as part of that

576
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,840
envelope right because this is the

577
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
conversation you don't see unless you're

578
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,400
at a command line

579
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
so once you get back the okay then the

580
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,159
client knows it can start sending a

581
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,919
message

582
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,679
this is the envelope mail from

583
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,880
got it

584
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,120
so mail from this is again this is

585
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,880
essentially all

586
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,799
command line stuff it's just telling the

587
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,159
server this is where you're going to

588
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,720
send this it doesn't necessarily care

589
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,840
it's just accepting this information

590
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,640
and

591
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,039
then the server says all right who's it

592
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:21,919
for

593
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,480
you tell it receipt two

594
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,400
give it that information and you see how

595
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,919
this is built

596
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,320
it is literally a conversation between

597
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,360
point a and point b

598
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,320
so what i often ask the folks that i'm

599
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,960
trying to help is i say to them

600
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,080
cool

601
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,360
we get all the way through this

602
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,000
conversation the next piece is the data

603
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,600
and you'll note my little note here

604
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,520
about the data will often include the

605
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
date the to and the from

606
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,440
so if that's where the two in the from

607
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,840
the user sees how easy is it for me to

608
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,600
put anything i want in there

609
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,559
really easy right

610
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,320
so

611
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,159
that's all this is

612
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,320
all right now tell me where's the

613
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,799
security in any of this

614
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,240
do you see anything about encryption

615
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,039
now

616
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,159
hmm

617
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,640
how about uh

618
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,039
i don't know any other mythical magical

619
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,159
way to

620
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,760
to secure this conversation

621
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,080
yeah okay we could we could you know you

622
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,280
can set up

623
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,600
uh you know the conversation itself

624
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,080
could in theory be encrypted

625
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,919
but really this is just plain text data

626
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,360
going back and forth

627
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,760
that's all this is there's no security

628
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,559
built into this by default

629
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,240
and that's the problem with email and

630
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,679
that's always been the problem with me

631
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,679
now because what did i say about the

632
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,440
history of all of this

633
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,159
what i told you was four computing

634
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,480
centers decided they wanted backups for

635
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,520
each other and that decided to connect

636
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,760
there's nothing about security there

637
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,600
there's nothing about encryption you

638
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,440
know again

639
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,760
this is built on these original ideas

640
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,159
and so every time they tried to add to

641
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,039
it they literally had to add on stuff

642
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,960
and so anything that you see that goes

643
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,880
above and beyond these basics they're

644
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,360
add-ons and they break

645
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,280
and so without a complete overhaul which

646
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,640
i don't think we're ever going to see in

647
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,000
email

648
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,640
this is the reality

649
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,039
all right so we have this conversation

650
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,120
it finishes it literally tells it i'm

651
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,200
done and it quits and it says okay

652
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,720
goodbye

653
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,120
so it's literally a conversation

654
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,320
so here's a great example of a type of

655
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,360
employment scam that we get so regularly

656
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,919
it makes my eyes bleed

657
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,799
there is a person named ryan austin at

658
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,240
our university

659
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,520
he is a research analyst and he did not

660
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,440
send this message

661
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,919
but you can see why a student receiving

662
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,760
this message would think wow this is

663
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,080
pretty convincing

664
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,960
now if you're from my area you would

665
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,960
probably know that 774 is not a local

666
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,279
area code and maybe that might tip you

667
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,600
off but okay people have cell phones

668
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,320
from anywhere maybe not

669
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
so this is the kind of thing

670
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,960
that i am frequently asked is this

671
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,440
legitimate or crap i've just lost a

672
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,039
bunch of money or something bad just

673
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,960
happened because i responded to this and

674
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,480
whatever

675
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,000
now there's one

676
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,320
really obvious weird thing in this

677
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,880
message does anybody see it

678
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,279
right is this weird gmail address so

679
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,039
sometimes attackers are really stupid

680
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,360
and they actually put in the body of the

681
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,400
message

682
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,279
the reply to as something else and they

683
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,720
literally set it up that way so that

684
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,120
when you hit reply it doesn't actually

685
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,520
go to the what's listed in the from it

686
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,320
goes to this other address so okay you

687
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,039
know

688
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,919
if they do that it's you know could help

689
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,480
in their cause

690
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,400
now i know this is probably really hard

691
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,799
to see

692
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,360
my thing with me um

693
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,879
but what i want you to notice

694
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,159
is this line right here can you see my

695
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,159
my mouse

696
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,559
all right

697
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,559
so when we

698
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,279
when we read email headers

699
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,760
we read the bottom up

700
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,360
and we're going to i'm going to flip

701
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,799
back and forth between this slide and

702
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,080
the next slide but i want to just kind

703
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
of take a look

704
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,960
so

705
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,520
the stuff that we see at the very bottom

706
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,320
the reply to the from the to the subject

707
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,360
that's all

708
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,520
the body of the message

709
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,360
none of that is the envelope none of

710
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,440
that is truly the header information

711
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,679
it's everything above that that's really

712
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:52,720
the header

713
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,159
i mean this stuff's in the header

714
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,440
because

715
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,760
it's just part of what you see

716
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,919
but the the real part of the header

717
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,520
is going to be the very first sign you

718
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,679
see received from

719
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,919
and that very first ip address

720
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,200
that's where that message originated

721
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,400
all right

722
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,679
so these are the things we're going to

723
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:12,960
look for like i said we'll go back and

724
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,640
forth so that you can actually see these

725
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,600
things

726
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,400
so

727
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,240
remember that i said the way the header

728
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
is written

729
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,919
it's line by line right as that

730
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,480
conversation is going as it's being sent

731
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
from one server to another

732
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,720
it starts with that bottom line and then

733
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,960
the next line up and then the next line

734
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,840
up and so read bottom up legacy

735
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,320
slots hang upside down very handy if

736
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
they wanted to be email headers which

737
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,720
would be weird because there's lots

738
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,919
so you look for that first received from

739
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,520
and then we're going to look for some

740
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,760
consistent inconsistencies

741
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,480
so

742
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,279
for example

743
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,279
this message is supposed to be from

744
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,159
somebody at buffalo.edu

745
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,760
so

746
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,960
if we looked up this ip address this 160

747
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,120
116 etc

748
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,279
and we said who owns this we would

749
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,640
determine very quickly this is not a

750
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,240
buffalo.edu address

751
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,679
okay

752
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,559
that should give you pause

753
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,640
the other thing that of course you will

754
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,159
see in here if you if you dig further um

755
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,760
is the fact that it goes through this

756
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,520
weird website welcome.com

757
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,159
that's also really bizarre because the

758
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,200
university has its own mail servers

759
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,120
which at this point we go through

760
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,880
microsoft

761
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,200
uh 365 exchange online so if anything

762
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,120
you saw a third party it would be

763
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,600
something like a google or a microsoft

764
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,640
not

765
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,360
website welcome like what the hell is

766
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,640
that right

767
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,840
so

768
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,240
you look for inconsistencies the other

769
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,080
things that you would look for

770
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,399
that again i know aren't like super

771
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,600
obvious

772
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,080
but you would look for date and time

773
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,919
stamp inconsistencies because when

774
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,240
attackers monkey with this they will

775
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,200
sometimes tinker with the date and time

776
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,279
like i said you can monkey with the

777
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,399
headers it's just not super easy but if

778
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,440
you know that we're located in

779
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,919
the eastern time zone and you see mail

780
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,279
coming from some other time zone

781
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,279
and it's not a case where you have a

782
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,039
third party server you should be

783
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,960
scratching your head going

784
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,760
why am i seeing this

785
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,720
so

786
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,080
you know you can look for embedded urls

787
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,360
and you can say

788
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,480
huh this message supposedly comes from x

789
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,799
and the url that's in the message

790
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,399
doesn't match that domain that's a

791
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,679
little weird

792
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,120
again we talked about time stamps

793
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,480
sometimes they'll put stuff in the wrong

794
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,600
order

795
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,840
so that's something you can look for

796
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,200
um

797
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
and the human element for verification

798
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,880
right one of the things i tell folks is

799
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,799
look i can't answer for you for every

800
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,080
message you get whether this is

801
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,320
legitimate like you know again folks

802
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,679
want to know and that's fine and i'm

803
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,039
happy to help them

804
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,760
but we have three campuses and you know

805
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,960
40 000 students and there's one of me

806
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,799
so one of the things that i teach them

807
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,799
to do

808
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,120
is to make a phone call you think that

809
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,960
you've gotten a message from your bank

810
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,760
that you know says this is your account

811
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,240
has been popped or something

812
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,000
pick up the phone

813
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,240
and call the number that you know

814
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
nothing that's in the message

815
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,200
that the bank uses right contact them in

816
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,000
a way that you know is legitimate

817
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,559
so you know if all else fails and you're

818
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,640
looking at this and you're just not sure

819
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,720
i mean we get departments that send

820
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,159
things through third parties all the

821
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,039
time

822
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:43,919
and

823
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,159
i can't stop that i you know we try to

824
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,760
work with these departments to try to

825
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,840
make what they're sending look as

826
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,520
legitimate as possible and make

827
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,279
references to another website so that

828
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,600
folks can verify that because we don't

829
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,679
expect them to read the headers right

830
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,840
that's not something we expect of them

831
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,440
so these are the kinds of things that

832
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,840
you're going to look for

833
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,720
all right

834
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,960
so how do you find

835
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,120
these these headers to even send them

836
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,600
because if you're going to report that

837
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,679
you have this garbage coming from an

838
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,760
account that's not yours and you know

839
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,840
it's made to look like it's yours

840
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,799
i will tell you right away do not

841
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,120
forward the message to

842
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,480
the offender

843
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,640
and say hey this piece of garbage came

844
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,039
from gmail fix your stuff

845
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,880
because they will say

846
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,039
i don't believe you

847
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,840
now why will they say that

848
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,279
what if you if you just forward the

849
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,840
message what have you not provided to

850
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,120
them

851
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,279
the header details and what do we just

852
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,080
say is necessary to determine whether

853
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,399
that message actually came through gmail

854
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,360
right

855
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,159
so

856
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,760
if you have one of these things and you

857
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,760
need to report it it's going to be your

858
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,240
number one tip so i do teach

859
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,480
folks how to find the headers and send

860
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,399
them to me

861
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,880
these are the sort of general here's how

862
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,559
you get them from gmail here's how you

863
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,000
get them from outlook you know owa

864
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,720
in most email clients the other thing

865
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,159
you can sometimes do is create a brand

866
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,440
new message

867
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,399
and attach the suspect message as an

868
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,919
attachment and you get the headers that

869
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,320
way but just forwarding that

870
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,480
if we if you think about what we said

871
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
about how email works

872
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,080
what ends up happening is when you

873
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,799
forward that message those headers get

874
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,960
rewritten and that communication from

875
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,720
the last server is all you're going to

876
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,679
see

877
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,360
so you're going to miss that whole early

878
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,158
conversation

879
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,600
all right

880
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,640
so

881
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,640
we know this is badness we know it is

882
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,480
malicious

883
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,600
what do we do with this well

884
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,720
this gets complicated only because

885
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,600
uh

886
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
it used to be that you could look up

887
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,000
abuse addresses and they were all listed

888
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,600
it was public information and it was

889
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,080
super easy to notify

890
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,519
that is not so much the case anymore

891
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,200
so

892
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,360
you need to look up who the domain owner

893
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,840
is not the

894
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,440
registrant and there are tools you can

895
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,679
do that make this fairly easy i'll have

896
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,760
one on the slide one of them a bit one

897
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,640
is called domain dossier it's very handy

898
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,159
it will give you all kinds of really

899
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,640
cool info it's free

900
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,159
the problem is because of gdpr

901
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,080
a lot of organizations have redacted all

902
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,519
that information

903
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,000
so you get you know garbage from

904
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,600
some place and you look up the ip

905
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,960
address and you find out it's

906
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,240
badfing.com and you'll pay you look up

907
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,039
who's abuse use the abuse contact for

908
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,120
bad thing.com

909
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,799
i don't know it's been redacted well

910
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,320
that's annoying

911
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,480
but even some of these companies that

912
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,159
have redacted

913
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,240
the bulk of the information they have

914
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,320
some sort of email address and if you

915
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,799
send a note to that email address they

916
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,880
send you back instructions

917
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,640
either they send you back a link to a

918
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,960
form they'll send you back

919
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,720
please provide the following information

920
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,360
here it's almost always the same kinds

921
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,960
of things they want those headers they

922
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,519
want proof that that message originated

923
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,760
with them which is what i would expect

924
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,279
doing the same thing

925
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,440
because if we genuinely have an account

926
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,600
that's compromised i want to know about

927
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,080
it because hello i want to get that

928
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,080
a compromise account shut down i want to

929
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,240
get those credentials reset

930
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,159
but the only way i know for sure

931
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,000
if someone spoofs the message if it

932
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,919
really came from our mail servers is

933
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,519
that header so that's what they're going

934
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,120
to expect too

935
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,000
some providers gmail has a form aws has

936
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,039
a form

937
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,799
um microsoft if you uh if you email

938
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,320
like if you get garbage that comes from

939
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,080
like outlook.com

940
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,760
they just use abuse outlook.com so abuse

941
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,320
ads sometimes will just work uh it

942
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,480
sometimes doesn't work some of these

943
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,399
places will lock down the reviews so you

944
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,919
can't send to them which is stupid

945
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,200
because it kind of goes against the

946
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
point

947
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,440
so if it is redacted follow whatever

948
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,800
instructions are there sometimes you

949
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
have to dig and there are times where

950
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,199
you're just not gonna find that data

951
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,560
which is a pain

952
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,800
um but more often than not there's

953
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,520
something you can report to

954
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,800
you can report bad urls the same way

955
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,480
you're going to look up the domain so if

956
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,079
somebody sends a phishing message with a

957
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,599
url in it

958
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,280
and i'm reporting

959
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,199
i'm going to report both

960
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,960
who sent the message so where did it

961
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,760
originate and the garbage url that's in

962
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,239
it so i can try to get that taken down

963
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,839
because if it's a phishing message i

964
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,760
don't want folks to click on it yes

965
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,280
there's other things i can do in the

966
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,719
meantime right

967
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,239
if you have tools that allow you to

968
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,359
block like that's a thing right so like

969
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,040
if if you're um

970
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,879
if you have some sort of

971
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,359
uh maybe black hole dns where you can

972
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,440
add it to a list somewhere or your

973
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,000
firewall has special protections

974
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,359
um you know cool but what if somebody's

975
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,040
not behind those protections they're at

976
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,359
home and they're looking at it right so

977
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,160
uh so i try especially if it's something

978
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,960
that's particularly bad um

979
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,800
and when i say that for argumentization

980
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
in particular it's something that maybe

981
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,040
mimics one of our login pages or would

982
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,000
be particularly convincing to our folks

983
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,839
right

984
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,880
so um i found this out actually

985
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,839
from a friend of mine who does a lot of

986
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,560
business email compromise

987
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,079
he said

988
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,040
with these two particular

989
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,839
mechanisms these are some other ways you

990
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,320
can report the url so if the domain is

991
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,440
owned and

992
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,280
managed by name chief

993
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,599
which is notorious for bad garbage

994
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,200
because

995
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,680
as their name implies they're cheap

996
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,880
right

997
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,520
and they don't really care who's

998
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,280
registering domains they don't care who

999
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,800
owns them

1000
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
if you tweet

1001
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,599
at

1002
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,839
namecheap and say hey there's this you

1003
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,000
know garbage out there within the hour

1004
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
they'll take it down typically so that

1005
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
was cool i didn't know that

1006
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,440
and the other thing you can do is you

1007
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,240
can submit to virustotal now virustotal

1008
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,599
is good and bad

1009
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,599
right as somebody who does any kind of

1010
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,200
incident response

1011
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,320
if you submit a file or something to

1012
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,240
virustotal you've now essentially given

1013
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,599
it to the universe

1014
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,280
everybody and their brother can have a

1015
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,560
copy of that

1016
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,359
now if it's the case where there's

1017
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,760
nothing of yours of value of your

1018
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,079
institutions which with a file you don't

1019
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,359
always know

1020
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,839
but if it's a bad

1021
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,400
url like it's out there right like

1022
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,920
there's probably nothing in your

1023
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,680
organization where that's going to be an

1024
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,760
issue and the cool thing is if you

1025
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,320
report that bad url

1026
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,839
now everybody and their mother gets a

1027
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,280
hold of it and sometimes it gets taken

1028
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,400
out faster

1029
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,720
so um you know so that's a thing

1030
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,440
so we'll touch briefly on these advanced

1031
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,680
concepts i i don't want to spend a lot

1032
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,119
of time on it

1033
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,800
but there are these three additional

1034
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,720
email things that have been added i

1035
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,680
mentioned

1036
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,040
that in the last update to

1037
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,359
the protocols they've actually added

1038
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,400
this information to them which

1039
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,280
does provide some security measures so

1040
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,320
the spf basically says

1041
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,839
did this message come from an approved

1042
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,160
server or not

1043
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,720
here's the cool thing about spf records

1044
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,800
you don't have to have them so lots of

1045
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
people don't or lots of institutions

1046
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,079
don't

1047
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,400
and even if you have them

1048
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,960
you can simply ignore what they say

1049
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,839
so

1050
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,320
just because you know just because there

1051
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,960
is an spf record does not mean that it

1052
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,160
matters

1053
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,800
but it is sometimes handy and in the

1054
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,119
header you can sometimes see a reference

1055
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,079
to it uh and if i had it behind me it

1056
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,359
would be easier and i could show you

1057
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,440
because that one message does

1058
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,680
um so dkim

1059
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,520
actually validates whether that message

1060
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,000
is authentic by adding this digital

1061
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,119
signature

1062
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,960
again it's not something that is

1063
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,400
required it is an add-on to uh you know

1064
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,920
that rfc

1065
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,520
and um

1066
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,280
it's another thing that you can turn on

1067
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,400
but not actually do anything

1068
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,359
to stop you know mail

1069
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,800
dmarc takes those two things together to

1070
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,240
try to prevent spoofing so if you put

1071
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,480
both of those things in place

1072
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,280
it will say oh this message supposedly

1073
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,560
comes from

1074
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,800
user at buffalo.edu

1075
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,920
well there's no valid signature and or

1076
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,240
it didn't actually come from

1077
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,240
user at because it's it's looking at

1078
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,240
that header information it's making that

1079
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,280
call

1080
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
um while it's doing well it's doing the

1081
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,359
envelope thing right so if that's in

1082
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,560
place

1083
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,720
it will drop the message

1084
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,040
and so these things are additions

1085
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,880
they're not perfect there are still ways

1086
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,320
to get around them even if they're in

1087
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,280
place but it does help

1088
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,880
so those are some things that can be

1089
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,599
added

1090
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,280
so these are some cool

1091
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,599
online tools you can just google them i

1092
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,119
didn't put the urls in here because i

1093
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,960
knew that like most people would just

1094
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,640
want a screenshot

1095
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,320
if you google domain dossier it can do

1096
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,040
domain and ip analysis so when you're

1097
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,720
when you're doing this research right

1098
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,079
and you're looking at that header and

1099
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,440
you're saying all right i have that

1100
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,040
weird ip address

1101
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,440
and whose ip address is this and who

1102
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,079
who's responsible for it and

1103
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,079
remember that you want to be looking for

1104
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,920
the domain owner

1105
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,839
and potentially technical contact not

1106
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,680
the registrant

1107
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,280
so for any of you who aren't familiar

1108
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,960
the registrant is just the person who

1109
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,359
registered with whoever provides that ip

1110
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,119
address with with the domain and ties

1111
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,560
those together

1112
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,800
they often don't care about whether

1113
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,680
their ips are used for badness you can

1114
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,680
report to them as well they often will

1115
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,400
tell you we don't care uh you know tell

1116
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,240
the company that actually owns it but on

1117
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,160
occasion especially if it's particularly

1118
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,480
bad they will do something

1119
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,560
so the other neat thing that domain

1120
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,160
dossier will do

1121
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,000
is it will look for what services are

1122
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,480
open um for that particular domain so

1123
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,000
we'll tell you are their mail services

1124
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,480
open are there uh you know is port 80

1125
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,040
open is 443 open and that can sometimes

1126
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,920
give you

1127
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,680
other contact information and other

1128
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,640
useful data so i i use domain dossier a

1129
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,520
lot it just it gives you so in the olden

1130
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,760
days we used to do this

1131
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,480
manually via nslookup which is command

1132
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,680
line thing

1133
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,000
really cool gives you lots of info but

1134
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,520
you need to know you needed to know all

1135
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,040
the different

1136
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,720
uh switches and what not to get the data

1137
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,400
back this just gives it all to you in

1138
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,680
one place and you don't have to bounce

1139
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,079
back and forth which is really nice

1140
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,839
the mx toolbox is a header analyzer

1141
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,520
it will take the header and it will

1142
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,599
actually break it down and say

1143
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,480
from

1144
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,200
to

1145
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
and that very ugly header that you were

1146
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,119
looking at it will make it much easier

1147
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,240
to read

1148
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,440
what i will warn you about is any email

1149
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,880
analyzer

1150
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,800
is only as smart as the people who

1151
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,200
programmed it and the header it's given

1152
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,920
the headers in some cases

1153
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,240
give you information in the reverse

1154
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,520
order

1155
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,680
because that's how the client is giving

1156
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,800
it to you

1157
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,760
so you're looking at what this analyzer

1158
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,359
is showing you and you're like why does

1159
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,760
this make no sense i know headers read

1160
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,319
from bottom to top why is it backwards

1161
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,240
oh

1162
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,319
so if you use just

1163
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,280
caveat analyzers are great and sometimes

1164
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,800
when you get headers

1165
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,599
uh they're even harder to read there

1166
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,520
there's no line breaks like those are

1167
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,680
sometimes really really hard to follow

1168
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,880
and that's where this can be somewhat

1169
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,720
helpful but just be aware that when

1170
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,960
you're looking at that you may get even

1171
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,400
more confused by

1172
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,240
the way they parse out that data

1173
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,640
if you have an email message that has

1174
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,280
some kind of weird encoding

1175
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,359
crap in it whether it's in the header

1176
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,599
itself which does sometimes happen

1177
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,480
attackers will try to hide stuff about

1178
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,560
where the message originated or there's

1179
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,160
something in the message itself that you

1180
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,640
need to decode has anyone seen url that

1181
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,480
has like a bunch of gobbledygook and

1182
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,839
you're like what is all of this

1183
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:31,839
gobbledygook so sometimes

1184
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,480
that is just encoded stuff and there's

1185
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,480
this awesome tool called cyber chef

1186
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,960
which again website just go there

1187
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,319
and it

1188
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,640
it has a bunch of options that are drag

1189
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,400
and drop you put the code

1190
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,319
in one little box

1191
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,200
and

1192
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,640
uh you

1193
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,119
tell it what kind of decryption method

1194
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,520
you want to use by dragging and dropping

1195
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,520
or you can use what's called magic where

1196
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,119
it just kind of tries to figure it out

1197
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,760
for you and it will show you

1198
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,160
how you know what it decrypted into if

1199
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,119
it can

1200
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,640
so that's a really handy thing if

1201
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,720
there's encoded sections of that header

1202
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,960
and then message header analyzer is just

1203
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,119
another tool that does more or less what

1204
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,240
mx toolbox can do only all it does is

1205
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,160
the header part it doesn't do the mx

1206
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,839
lookup so if you actually want to do the

1207
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,880
mx lookup um some of that data is in mx

1208
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,560
toolbox and you can also find some of

1209
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,200
that in domain dossier

1210
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,119
so i like to close with this quote and

1211
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,800
then i'll open it up to questions

1212
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,079
because

1213
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,560
my background i actually started in the

1214
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,920
music business

1215
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,839
my degrees in music industry

1216
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,400
i started a long way from here i had

1217
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,839
absolutely no intention of ever going

1218
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,280
into technology

1219
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,119
but i had an email address at five years

1220
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,480
old

1221
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,160
and this was the direction i wound up

1222
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,119
going

1223
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,599
and so i may not have gone where i

1224
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,760
intended to go but i'm pretty sure i

1225
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,839
ended up exactly where i'm supposed to

1226
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:56,640
be

1227
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,920
and with that

1228
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,760
questions

1229
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,640
yes

1230
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,800
are there any like safe alternatives to

1231
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,560
email that do you use

1232
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,759
regular encryption or

1233
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,800
so i'm going to repeat the question for

1234
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,119
those of you who didn't hear are there

1235
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,240
alternatives to email that are safer or

1236
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,200
uh offer encryption um

1237
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,440
not in the sort of easy method that

1238
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,520
we're accustomed to an email

1239
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,119
what i tell folks is if you really need

1240
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,359
to send something an email and it really

1241
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,839
needs to be encrypted put it in a file

1242
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,760
zip it up add a password i mean it's a

1243
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
payment drain right but if you really

1244
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,359
need to send it that way

1245
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,760
um you know obviously the safest

1246
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,680
mechanism is sneaker net go and hand it

1247
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,040
to somebody but that's just not always

1248
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,119
practical so um

1249
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,880
you know

1250
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,640
there are lots of ways to make emails

1251
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,079
safer but you're never going to make it

1252
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,680
100 secure any more than you can make

1253
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,960
anything else 100 secure

1254
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,720
any other questions

1255
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,480
yes

1256
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,160
as a business would you recommend

1257
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,200
setting up an abuse

1258
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,640
it's usually best practice

1259
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,800
if you own a particular domain it's good

1260
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,160
because then if another entity sees mail

1261
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,839
that legitimately appears to be coming

1262
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,680
from you they can let you know

1263
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,240
if it's a small business often you work

1264
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,040
with

1265
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,400
the host provider

1266
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,359
and you you either sort of dovetail that

1267
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,119
um and you you know you can talk to them

1268
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,640
about how you want to manage that but

1269
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,880
yeah i think it's invaluable because

1270
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,440
honestly how else will you know right

1271
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,920
like i and i have been known i will tell

1272
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,000
you i have been known to email the

1273
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,160
business directly if i see like for

1274
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,119
example another um great use case is

1275
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,280
your website is compromised and it is

1276
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,920
now hosting a phishing site and you have

1277
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,680
no idea until i email you and say hey

1278
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,000
uh you know person at company.com your

1279
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
you know clearly your web server has an

1280
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,640
issue here but you never know that so if

1281
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,880
your secretary person gets that email

1282
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,560
they may just toss that away because

1283
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,800
they don't know but yes if you set up

1284
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,319
the question in case i didn't repeat

1285
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,720
that was um as a business should you set

1286
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,760
up an abuse at and my answer is yes

1287
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,839
either directly or through

1288
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,079
your your isp or you know whoever's

1289
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,560
providing your services it's not a bad

1290
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,319
idea because there really should be a

1291
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,079
way for folks to let you know you have a

1292
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,440
problem that's not going to go to

1293
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,200
somebody who doesn't realize this really

1294
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,200
is legitimate

1295
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,000
yes

1296
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,119
how does stuff like pgp and a service

1297
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,280
like protonmail fit into the whole

1298
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,560
security

1299
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,839
so the question is how does something

1300
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,560
like pgt or protonmail fit fit into this

1301
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,200
so um pgp is going to uh going to offer

1302
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,760
some external encryption

1303
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,280
of files typically protonmail is

1304
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,359
supposed to be end-to-end encrypted and

1305
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:50,640
here's what i will tell you about

1306
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,119
services like protonmail someone else

1307
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,440
owns them

1308
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,359
bottom line someone else owns that if

1309
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,560
you don't own it and you don't manage it

1310
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,359
can you trust it 100

1311
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:06,880
and for those of you aren't familiar

1312
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,319
protonmail claims to be 100 safe

1313
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,839
encrypted no one else can read your

1314
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:12,880
stuff

1315
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,000
well the reality is you don't know that

1316
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
you know what they tell you

1317
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,920
and that's true for a lot of these

1318
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,119
services and and you know you don't know

1319
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,200
if they have your encryption key

1320
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,319
they could

1321
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:27,119
i mean

1322
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,800
how do you know yes

1323
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,880
dr woman um do you personally

1324
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,880
unsubscribe because a lot of people are

1325
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,359
reluctant to unsubscribe because then

1326
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,359
it's like you're doing like a sin accent

1327
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:38,480
you're letting them know that you're

1328
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,040
alive so the question is

1329
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,839
do i unsubscribe to things because

1330
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,359
there's this notion that if you

1331
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,119
unsubscribe then you're letting them

1332
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,040
know you exist

1333
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,400
sometimes

1334
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,000
like most things the answer is it

1335
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,119
depends

1336
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,200
i will often do some if it's a

1337
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,920
legitimate business that i that i know

1338
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,040
and i've done

1339
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,400
stuff with and i just don't want their

1340
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,359
stuff anymore i will unsubscribe if i'm

1341
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:04,720
getting

1342
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,400
spam from an organization i've never

1343
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,040
heard of i might if it's annoying enough

1344
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,240
i might research it such that uh i can

1345
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,960
determine do they have an unsubscribe on

1346
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,040
their website that seems to be the same

1347
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,119
like is there some other mechanism that

1348
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,520
tells me this is legitimate i will not

1349
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,480
typically unsubscribe to stuff randomly

1350
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,520
uh just because i get stuff because yes

1351
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,000
you can absolutely get into lists in

1352
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,160
that way and that's really annoying so

1353
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,280
you know you kind of have to do your

1354
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,240
homework unfortunately

1355
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,920
you're welcome yes

1356
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,079
are you opposed to

1357
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,119
dropping

1358
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,720
emails

1359
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,920
that

1360
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,680
failed

1361
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,839
am i opposed to dropping emails that

1362
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,440
fail spf

1363
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,880
personally no

1364
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,720
it's a business tolerance decision it's

1365
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,200
very much a business decision so

1366
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,960
one of the good things that i will tell

1367
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,960
you remember i mentioned spf you can

1368
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,040
have it on but essentially you can still

1369
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,440
have it passing mail so it just tells

1370
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,839
you whether or not it's failed um a good

1371
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,839
practice to get into if you're going to

1372
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,040
use something like that and you

1373
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,520
ultimately want to make it a permanent

1374
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,640
thing

1375
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,040
turn it on and start watching to get a

1376
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,839
feel for what you would be dropping and

1377
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,000
that'll tell you you know

1378
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,960
we have a problem where messages are you

1379
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,240
know going to be dropped that are

1380
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,839
totally legitimate and it's going to be

1381
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,920
this you know large number of messages

1382
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,000
and that could be an issue so i would

1383
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,079
say if you if you can turn these

1384
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,160
features on by all means you should turn

1385
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,160
them on but put them in a pass-through

1386
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,680
mode and start to get a feel for where

1387
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,599
your problems are if you're a business

1388
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,680
that has a sub-domain so the university

1389
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,640
has a lot of sub-domains you can wind up

1390
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,240
in a huge headache if you don't do that

1391
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,559
and get a feel for it first

1392
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,839
any other questions

1393
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,040
all right well thank you again so much

1394
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,040
