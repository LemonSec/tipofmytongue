[Music]

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,920
okay

4
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,839
oh

5
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,960
hello everyone

6
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,879
i'm kyle hinterberg

7
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,400
today i'm going to be talking about

8
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,240
hacking the compliance kernel

9
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,080
and this isn't really what you know most

10
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,280
of us probably think about when we think

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
about cyphercon and hacking but

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,720
it is something that might save us some

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,280
some headaches and some stress

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,720
so right up front the tldr

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,400
you know the problems with the

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,479
compliance is we fail because we avoid

17
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,040
the annoying aspects of compliance and

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,960
what we need to do instead is understand

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,880
our compliance obligations

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,560
automate all the things

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,720
minimize the residual annoyance and

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,479
focus on the more fulfilling aspects of

23
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,880
the job

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
so how do i want to talk through that

25
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,040
you know first a little bit of who i am

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,640
and why you care

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,960
then some um kind of the idea of the

28
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,479
compliance kernel what it is and why i

29
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,159
should hack it some tangible methods for

30
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,640
hacking compliance you know really my my

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,640
goal is twofold one is to have

32
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,479
potentially some tangible methods some

33
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,920
things you can take away but also just

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,159
to get you thinking you know i know i

35
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,479
myself have worked in compliance and the

36
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,159
problem i find a lot of times is that we

37
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,000
all think we're doing what we need to do

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,680
because it's what we've always done

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,280
and we need to get away from that and

40
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,200
figure out what we need to do because we

41
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,760
need to do it

42
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:14,959
so

43
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,720
again i'm kyle right now i'm a manager

44
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,640
at lbmc but the interesting thing about

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,239
anyone isn't you know where they are but

46
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,000
how they got there i started as a

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
systems administrator and a small team

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,520
kind of doing everything from end users

49
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,200
of support to vulnerability management

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,120
you know dealing with compliance in

51
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,239
general

52
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,319
want to be a compliance analyst had to

53
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,720
work on you know pci hipaa socks all the

54
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,360
different things kind of internally then

55
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,959
i moved to the other side of the table

56
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,720
became a compliance consultant you know

57
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,800
kind of doing all those same things

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,959
and the reason i tell you all that is i

59
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,040
feel completely qualified to tell you

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
compliance sucks and that's just that

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,519
the nature of compliance it sucks and

62
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,280
you know hopefully you know i can help

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,720
talk through a few ways we can make it

64
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,400
suck a little less

65
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,239
um and the things i'm going to be

66
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,840
talking through aren't even really like

67
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,000
problems with budget it's to me a bigger

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
problem with mindset you know i think

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,599
about when i go to the grocery store if

70
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,680
i take time before i go to write out a

71
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,120
list i go to the store i walk through

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,640
all the aisles i get everything i need

73
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,040
and go home and i got food for my family

74
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,959
if i go there i'm hungry and i didn't

75
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,319
bother to make a list i'd leave with a

76
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,959
bucket of popcorn chicken so

77
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,239
that's why we need to you know get the

78
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,920
right mindset and think about compliance

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,599
ahead of time rather than you know kind

80
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,400
of chasing it and just as a note you

81
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,519
know when i'm talking about some of the

82
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,040
compliance examples i'm going to be

83
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,720
using pci and that's just because that's

84
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,879
where my experience is i've worked a lot

85
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,640
in pci if you haven't worked in it

86
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,319
you're lucky but what it is it's the

87
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,080
payment card industry the dss at the

88
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,599
data security standard and it's just

89
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,040
around protecting credit card

90
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,599
information

91
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,239
so you know the idea of the compliance

92
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,280
kernel

93
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,120
obviously we all know the idea of a

94
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,799
computer currently you know a core

95
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,319
component of an operating system that

96
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,920
serves as the main interface between the

97
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,200
computer's physical hardware and the

98
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,799
process is running on it

99
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,519
to me i see compliance as being very

100
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,360
similar in a way

101
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,360
you know you have a security program and

102
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,120
the security program is really what's

103
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,879
important that's what's you know making

104
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,879
everything secure but you can't see a

105
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,519
security program or at least not easily

106
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,360
and so the compliance kernel to me is a

107
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,040
way to kind of abstract that you know

108
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,880
compliance is a core component of a

109
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,560
security program and it serves as the

110
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,320
main interface between security

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,400
configurations and the entities who need

112
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,000
to validate those security

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,919
configurations you know you look at

114
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,520
vulnerability scans you can absolutely

115
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,120
have a secure system and never run a

116
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,960
vulnerability scan on it but you can't

117
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,800
demonstrate that you can't validate that

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,960
system secure you know you can do

119
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,040
changes in a completely you know

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,199
consistent and secure way but you can't

121
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,320
prove that if you don't have change

122
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,080
tickets you know even policies and

123
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,600
procedures you can think that you're

124
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
being secure you can assume that you're

125
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,680
doing the right thing but if you don't

126
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,040
have a policy and procedure you don't

127
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
even know what your organization thinks

128
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,520
security means and so that's where you

129
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,199
know like especially me you know as a

130
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,120
consultant coming into an organization i

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,199
see compliance as really being that that

132
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,120
abstraction layer lets me understand

133
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,960
what's going on in the security program

134
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,440
so you know one thing too i think that's

135
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,800
worth covering a little bit is what is

136
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,400
hacking because obviously when we're

137
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,160
here at cyphercon you know

138
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,400
hacking has you know one idea of it and

139
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
this again doesn't exactly fall into

140
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,600
that you know and some people think

141
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,800
hackie means you know the malicious

142
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,240
attackers what you hear on the you know

143
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,000
news and whatnot and then you know some

144
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,360
people it's more of the programming

145
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,120
experts and to some people it's the life

146
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,960
hackers that tell you how to save five

147
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,080
minutes in the morning by putting

148
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,360
toothpaste in your coffee but to me

149
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,800
what makes a hacker is someone who

150
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,880
performs tasks using creative and effort

151
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,720
reducing methods you know that's really

152
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,560
the core of it someone you know like i

153
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,000
really feel hackers are different and

154
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,600
what it is is the way they approach

155
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,680
problems you know i don't consider

156
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,360
myself a hacker in the hoodie sense of

157
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,280
the word but i do feel i'm a hacker in

158
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,670
the way i approach and solve problems

159
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,160
[Music]

160
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,360
so

161
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,639
why is this all important why is it

162
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,400
important to hack compliance you know

163
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,560
the the problem is that even minor

164
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
compliance misses can lead to major

165
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,360
problems you know again i work in pci

166
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,280
and there's one requirement that is to

167
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,360
do quarterly vulnerability scans and

168
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,800
those scans have to be passing which

169
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,240
gets a little bit into the weeds but one

170
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,840
part of it is just you need to do

171
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,759
quarterly scan so you have to run a scan

172
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,319
every 90 days which seems pretty easy on

173
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,720
its base but that's you know actually

174
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,479
the biggest problem i run into with

175
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,560
clients you know in pci there's a lot of

176
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,720
very technical controls around how you

177
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,240
handle encryption how you're handling

178
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,160
authorization those are usually the

179
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,199
things that they're getting right

180
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,240
because they're a little bit more

181
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,759
interesting but it's the boring things

182
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,840
like running a scan every 90 days you

183
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,440
know in doing that manually that's where

184
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,759
clients fall down and you can have an

185
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,240
organization that's had you know passing

186
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,000
all you know hundreds and hundreds

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,160
literally of requirements for pci and

188
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,680
they're just missing you know a few

189
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,919
scans and they're not compliant and then

190
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,440
you know they have to deal with the

191
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
problems that come along with that

192
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,039
and even if you are doing everything you

193
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,759
need to manually maintaining compliance

194
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,280
sucks you know if you're running those

195
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,360
scans every quarter and you know doing

196
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,440
that on a manual basis and doing all

197
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,039
those very you know kind of menial

198
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,199
processes it sucks and that's where you

199
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,800
get burnout and that's where you know i

200
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,240
come to an organization it's like oh

201
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,680
yeah sally she's the one that does the

202
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
scans but she got burned out she quit no

203
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,880
one realized she's the only one that

204
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,479
knows how to do a scan

205
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,840
and now we don't have any vulnerability

206
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,000
scans and that's that's literally you

207
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,160
know a scenario i run into

208
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,720
on a routine basis

209
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,319
and so we all need to you know focus

210
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,160
again on the filling aspects of our job

211
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,800
to avoid burnout you know one thing i

212
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,560
hear a lot of talk about is the idea of

213
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,680
you know you don't want to automate

214
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,919
yourself out of a job but in my opinion

215
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,759
the thing we need to do is automate

216
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,759
ourselves into jobs we actually want

217
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,919
so

218
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,759
now into you know some of the actual you

219
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,520
know again tangible ways that in my

220
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,720
opinion we can do a little better

221
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,160
hacking compliance you know the top

222
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,319
thing is this rtfn you have to actually

223
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,080
read the manual figure out what's going

224
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,400
on again as a consultant all the time

225
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,840
i'm coming into organizations they've

226
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,360
never even read the standards they need

227
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,599
to adhere to and they're really putting

228
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,520
themselves in my hands i can tell them

229
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,599
like oh you don't know you know i can

230
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,960
tell you this is the way it applies to

231
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,240
you this is what you need to do and they

232
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,759
just you know generally believe me which

233
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,720
is hopefully good but they again are

234
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,639
just leaving themselves open to someone

235
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,400
misinterpreting requirements or telling

236
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,840
them they need to do things that they

237
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,039
don't need to do

238
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,800
and the same thing goes for scoping they

239
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,160
actually understand you know a

240
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,560
compliance obligation in which part of

241
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,479
your environment does it adhere to you

242
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,599
know you need to worry about it

243
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,319
everywhere only in a small place

244
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,120
again with pci um it revolves around

245
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,958
credit card data so a lot of times

246
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,320
organizations will think well we just

247
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,159
have these few servers over here they

248
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,760
process our credit card data that's all

249
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,279
we have to worry about nothing else you

250
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,719
know we're good

251
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,240
i come in you know start talking to

252
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,360
people you know the accounting

253
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,959
department has reports they have credit

254
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,320
card numbers in them or they don't have

255
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,000
network segmentation and pretty soon

256
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,680
everything's in scope and you know

257
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,680
they're falling down because of missing

258
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,839
those compliance

259
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,120
obligations and you know the same goes

260
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,600
for requirement relevancy

261
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
you know hitting on pci again obviously

262
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,959
with credit card information if you're

263
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,560
storing credit card information you need

264
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,320
to follow a whole bunch of credit card

265
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,920
requirements for storing that those

266
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,440
numbers if you don't store them you

267
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,560
don't need to do all that that's not

268
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,839
relevant to you you don't need to worry

269
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,720
about something you're not doing but

270
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,200
i have 100 seen organizations that are

271
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
adhering to requirements that mean

272
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,600
nothing to them and i've seen assessors

273
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,120
and auditors who are trying to hold

274
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,720
those organizations to do these things

275
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,000
that mean nothing to them and that's

276
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,839
where we really need to understand our

277
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,360
own environments we need to understand

278
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,200
their own compliance obligations so that

279
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,600
way we can understand and fight you know

280
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,120
with an auditor who's telling us to do

281
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,200
something that's kind of nonsense

282
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,279
um and you know once we get through that

283
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,720
we understand what we need to do and

284
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,959
have it you know really under control

285
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,480
the first thing that i kind of consider

286
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,920
more on the hack side of it is

287
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,519
consolidating controls and this is a

288
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,640
problem i see with a lot of

289
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,880
organizations they maybe have you know

290
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,120
pci they have hipaa they have high trust

291
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,680
they have you know these different um

292
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,080
you know kind of a slew of different um

293
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,399
obligations they need to be adhering to

294
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,760
and they consider them all different

295
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,120
they have you know this audit and this

296
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,480
set of controls and this audit and the

297
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,000
set of controls in this environment over

298
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
here that follows this set of controls

299
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,839
and they get stolen the weeds trying to

300
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,839
figure out what's going on where that

301
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,760
they you know things fall down again and

302
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,120
so that's where we need to work to

303
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,880
really consolidate those controls if

304
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
you're doing something for pci odds are

305
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,240
it's probably you know more or less what

306
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,920
need to be doing for high trust or a

307
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,120
sock audit a lot of the um compliance

308
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,560
requirements out there you know they're

309
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,320
a lot more the same than they are

310
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,920
different and even if you don't want to

311
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,360
take the time to do that yourself you

312
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,680
can go out online you know one of the um

313
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,600
a good resources though the unified

314
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,200
controls framework they make what they

315
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,279
refer to as their common controls hub

316
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,720
it's literally a list of you know

317
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,240
basically every control you could ever

318
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,560
imagine mapped out to every standard and

319
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,320
regulation you could ever imagine so you

320
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,240
can take that you know plug in what you

321
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,600
need to worry about it'll tell you the

322
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,360
controls you need to adhere to

323
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,880
so again rather than doing three

324
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,320
controls for three different audits you

325
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,240
figure out one control that it fits all

326
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,079
of them you do one control it meets them

327
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,760
all and you're good to go

328
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,120
even you know again pci just this year

329
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
they released the new version pci dss

330
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,399
4.0 and in there they have a new concept

331
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,640
of the customized control and that's

332
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,560
entirely for this point of trying to be

333
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,279
able to consolidate controls now with um

334
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,519
the customized control if you're doing

335
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,279
something really good you know for high

336
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,959
trust and then you come to pci it's like

337
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,200
oh here's this requirement it's very

338
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,640
similar to what i need to do over there

339
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,800
it has its standard control but they

340
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,399
also have the option of the customized

341
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,720
control and so you can take your control

342
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,079
that you already have in place if you

343
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,160
have a mature system and just slot it

344
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,600
right in for pci you don't even need to

345
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,200
worry about their standard controls

346
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,800
anymore and you can just move on again

347
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,000
with a smaller amount of consolidated

348
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
controls

349
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,279
then again you know the next thing we

350
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,399
need to automate everything you know

351
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,160
like i was saying earlier scans are the

352
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,720
big one i i honestly can't tell you why

353
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,399
people don't automate scans but a lot of

354
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,560
people don't they run them manually and

355
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,720
that's just the easy example you know

356
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,399
kind of low hanging fruit automate

357
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,839
everything you can do like that if you

358
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,839
have scans you need to run on a regular

359
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,600
basis automate them and if you need to

360
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
do quarterly vulnerability scans run

361
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,120
them weekly or run a monthly have it

362
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,959
happen more often so if one does fall

363
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,240
down one does get missed you have

364
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,720
something to back it up with

365
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,079
and even other things like you know

366
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,040
policy updates you know i write a lot of

367
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,880
policies i hate writing policies i'm not

368
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,720
going to go search out my policies to go

369
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,320
update them again but if you take the

370
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,920
time like oh i need to update this in a

371
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,839
year set a reminder so that way your

372
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,519
calendar pings you and says hey you need

373
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,959
to do this or even schedule yourself

374
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,399
some time in a year so you know when it

375
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,760
comes around you have a half hour to

376
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,959
actually read through that policy

377
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,560
updated as needed and it's good to go

378
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,000
instead of just dusting it off when the

379
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,839
auditors come around

380
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,519
and even evidence requests you know a

381
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,360
lot of times you know you have the same

382
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,040
evidence you're requesting every year if

383
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,399
you're working with you know different

384
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,320
teams you know for instance if you know

385
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,760
you need to ask

386
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,600
the network security team for a firewall

387
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,440
config or something of that just

388
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,040
schedule some of that stuff set it all

389
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,880
up so it just you know happens for you

390
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,480
and you don't need to remember

391
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,120
you know and um

392
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,040
another thing i find a lot of times you

393
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,800
know i think this is true just for it in

394
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,560
general is i feel like a lot of us are

395
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,000
you know kind of the green crayon people

396
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,079
we buy a box of crayons you pull up the

397
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,600
green crayon you only use that crayon

398
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,720
that's all you ever use you put the

399
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,800
other ones away

400
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,160
when it comes to you know like

401
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,079
vulnerability scans a great example is

402
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,839
if you're using nessus and jira you know

403
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,600
two very common solutions a lot of

404
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,680
people using ssn jira and you run your

405
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,279
scans and you go manually create all

406
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,880
your tickets but they have back end

407
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,720
integrations you can entirely make it so

408
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,360
you run a scan in ss it populates over

409
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,120
to jira makes all your change tickets

410
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,279
for you when you close out those tickets

411
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,760
it'll run rescans and nessus and tie it

412
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,200
all back you know and it's you know

413
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,880
entirely possible and that's just one

414
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,320
example there's you know other

415
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,680
integrations that you can do the same

416
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,279
thing just to take that headache off of

417
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,959
yourself so your stuff is doing your

418
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,359
work for you

419
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,399
and then we need to really minimize the

420
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,760
residual annoyance you know because at

421
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,199
the end of the day we can't automate

422
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,160
everything

423
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,680
you know we need to do things like

424
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,600
create enduring policies and dynamic

425
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,279
procedures this is kind of a pet peeve

426
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,199
of mine but i hate it when i see a

427
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,279
policy that has people's names in it or

428
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,800
you know that they're using cisco

429
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,880
firewalls those are things that you just

430
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,720
can't do you have to have a policy

431
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,480
that's you know can last for years it

432
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,480
should really be minimal to update a

433
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,920
policy and then you have a procedure

434
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,760
that's dynamic and that you can change

435
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,440
on an ongoing basis whenever you need to

436
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,199
every you know day if it needs to and

437
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,639
that's you know kind of just your living

438
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,760
document

439
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,680
and another thing we need to do is find

440
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,680
time to document you know that's a again

441
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,519
a thing i don't do that well but you

442
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,959
know if you're going through a process

443
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,560
just grab a few screenshots as you're

444
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,519
going through it and then when you're

445
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,360
done you have a procedure you know and

446
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,959
even as a consultant when i'm coming in

447
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,480
to do an audit you know if someone just

448
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
has five screenshots in word doc it's

449
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
not the best thing in the world but it's

450
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,240
better than nothing at least there is a

451
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,160
policy or a procedure in that case there

452
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,360
is something telling them what they

453
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,880
should be doing something i can kind of

454
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,680
follow along with and um understand

455
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,920
their system and how it's configured you

456
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,360
know and that's just you know where

457
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,440
something is almost always better than

458
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,199
nothing

459
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,800
and we also need to make sure that we're

460
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,880
making the rules easier to follow than

461
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,560
it is to avoid them

462
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,320
my favorite example kind of for this is

463
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
more on the entertainment industry you

464
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,560
know you look at back you know 10 15 20

465
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,079
years ago a lot of people were pirating

466
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,519
movies and that was just kind of the way

467
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,120
that a lot of people got their media was

468
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,040
through pirated movies

469
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
but more recently that's really you know

470
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,800
kind of trailed off because it's so much

471
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
easier just to pay netflix or pay disney

472
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,480
plus and to get all the access to all

473
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,639
the media you could ever need so just by

474
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,720
doing that you know you're easily

475
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,480
gaining access to it for a few dollars a

476
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,040
month and you're good to go

477
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,920
it just in making that easier you know

478
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
it's cut off on the pirating side and so

479
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,199
that's what we need to do too think

480
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,279
about the policies and the procedures

481
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,120
that you're making people adhere to you

482
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,519
know like password resets let them reset

483
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,600
their own password some of those little

484
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
things if you let users do themselves

485
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,759
and do it in an easy way they're not

486
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,279
going to try to go around you and

487
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,959
circumvent you to get to you know the

488
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,199
process themselves and it's one of those

489
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,639
areas where you know a lot of times you

490
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,000
get pushed back where it's like well we

491
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,279
can't do that because it's going to be

492
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,399
less secure

493
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,560
but is it less secure if you let someone

494
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,160
do something and they actually do it

495
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,000
versus you know making the process so

496
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,680
onerous that they don't do it at all and

497
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,360
they just you know round robin around

498
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,120
you

499
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,600
you know and even back to the whole idea

500
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,839
just on the automating too

501
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,600
one thing i like to think about is i

502
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,120
don't know if it's i'm the same as you

503
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,600
but i i don't know anyone's birthday i

504
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,360
couldn't tell you like when i last

505
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,320
changed my oil when i um how to even you

506
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,560
know get here all of those things i rely

507
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,639
on my technology to do for me you know i

508
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,480
have a phone that tells me it vibrates

509
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,680
oh it's you know 10 minutes to this

510
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,519
meeting or you know it's been a year

511
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,440
since you changed your oil those are the

512
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,800
types of things we need to be thinking

513
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,240
about in our job as well and just

514
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,920
letting our technology you know take

515
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,639
over for us

516
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,079
so you know again the last bullet at the

517
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,160
the front there that focus on the more

518
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,079
more fulfilling aspects of our job this

519
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,680
is really to me the whole point of this

520
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,079
is that i personally as a you know a

521
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,160
consultant again i see a lot of the

522
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,480
individuals i work with burn out you

523
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,280
know it's just kind of a draining job to

524
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,199
work in compliance and it's kind of

525
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,679
doing the same repetitive tasks over and

526
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,919
over and over and you know you got to

527
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,439
really think about why you're doing what

528
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,280
you do and is it just to kind of meet

529
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,799
your basic needs you're just making your

530
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,400
paycheck and that's it because it's such

531
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,480
a you know killing job

532
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,000
you know and if that's true that sucks

533
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,959
for you and it sucks for your

534
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,079
organization because you're going to

535
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,760
burn out again you're going to be sally

536
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,600
who leaves and the scans don't get done

537
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,280
so you got to figure out the way to you

538
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,799
know have your job meet more of those

539
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,559
psychological and self-fulfillment needs

540
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,240
you know like i've worked in compliance

541
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,039
now for over 10 years and i'll you know

542
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,160
again the first one to tell you

543
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,840
compliance sucks writing policy sucks

544
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,320
all that kind of stuff sucks but i like

545
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,000
building relationships with my clients i

546
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,760
like you know working with my co-workers

547
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,520
things like that is where i look to to

548
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,039
find those self-fulfillment needs and

549
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,720
make sure that i'm you know doing

550
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,919
something that i actually feel

551
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,679
productive in my job and i'm just not

552
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,160
making my paycheck

553
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,080
so um again

554
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,400
the tldr you know we fail because we

555
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,559
avoid the annoying aspects of compliance

556
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,400
what we need to do instead is understand

557
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,240
our compliance obligations automate all

558
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,080
the things minimize the residual

559
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,360
annoyance and focus on the more

560
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,480
fulfilling aspects of our jobs

561
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,559
there's my contact info i'll be around

562
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,799
here too and if anyone has any questions

563
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,080
i probably talked a little fast so we

564
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,720
have some extra time

565
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,400
thank you

566
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,969
[Music]

567
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,000
what's your opinion on

568
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,200
this csu

569
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,600
i like it

570
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,120
generally i would say that's a you know

571
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,640
a good framework

572
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,200
you know solid i like to use that and so

573
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,880
it's using that as kind of an overall

574
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,240
framework and then having other things

575
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
kind of you know piggyback off of that

576
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,840
in a sense i would agree with that kind

577
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,600
of approach

578
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,639
and then for risk

579
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,320
how do you tie your skin

580
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,919
as far as what he means

581
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,840
yeah doing

582
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,320
i know like pci that's one of the places

583
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,840
where my opinion falls down a little bit

584
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,440
it wants you to do you know the if you

585
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,039
if you have to deal with pci the risk

586
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,679
assessment on an annual basis which

587
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,200
that's you know

588
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,039
gets you passing there but in my opinion

589
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,120
handling risk on a more ongoing basis is

590
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,960
my general recommendation so you know to

591
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,720
really take a look at your risk and then

592
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,799
use some type of a tracker check in on

593
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,400
you know more of a quarterly basis would

594
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,320
be my general recommendation and update

595
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,120
stuff um on that type of a basis that

596
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,480
way you can actually track kind of your

597
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,320
poems what you're working on and you

598
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,880
know make progress on it beyond just

599
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,240
checking in once every 12 months

600
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,600
so dci core seems to have significant

601
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,159
changes from version three both in

602
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,840
requirements and

603
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,080
verbiage yes um

604
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,440
what do you think is gonna be the

605
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,120
biggest pitfalls for companies trying to

606
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,480
become compliant with britain

607
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,919
waiting until

608
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,320
version 321 expires and then looking at

609
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,440
four

610
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,799
that's i think they're going to be the

611
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,919
biggest problem i feel like there's

612
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,200
going to be a lot of companies that just

613
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,559
don't even look at 4 until it's too late

614
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,520
for the the most part for if you're

615
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,159
compliant with 321 you are going to be

616
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,559
mostly compliant with four there's only

617
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,120
really a few spots like a good for

618
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,799
instance is

619
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,799
potentially if you have car data and

620
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,400
you're transferring it internally in

621
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
your network that's something where now

622
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,679
that is going to have to be

623
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,840
encrypted so if you're doing those

624
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,000
internal you know car data transfers you

625
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,520
need to encrypt it inside the network

626
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,799
not just when it's going over the

627
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,320
internet some of those items might be um

628
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,559
a little bit more nitpicky of figuring

629
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,080
out how to redo internal network

630
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,600
infrastructure potentially where i could

631
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,760
see people you know having some problems

632
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,799
another one is around payment pages

633
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,159
there's a lot of

634
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,080
new requirements around making sure that

635
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,760
you know all the scripts and other

636
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,679
software on your payment page is known

637
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,679
to you and not able to change it you

638
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,039
know it kind of stopped like the mage

639
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,200
card style attacks and so some of those

640
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,520
are also going to be difficult um

641
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,360
overall i wouldn't say there's anything

642
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,720
that's you know

643
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,679
too too bad but um definitely going to

644
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,120
be things that are going to take you

645
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,960
know six months to you know a year to

646
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,720
get implemented i would say

647
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,679
but

648
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,440
the customized control i think is going

649
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,320
to help and another interesting spot for

650
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,600
that is um they also now have the

651
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,880
i think they changed the verbiage but

652
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,360
basically in place qualified is um an

653
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,400
item

654
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,080
it's not that's what they refer to in

655
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,320
one of the rfps but basically if you do

656
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,480
have a minor miss you can still consider

657
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,720
it in place as long as you've kind of

658
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,679
discussed it with your qsa

659
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,000
so you're not entirely you know sol in a

660
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,760
