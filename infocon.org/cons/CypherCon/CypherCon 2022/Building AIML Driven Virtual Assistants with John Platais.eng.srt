2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,700
thank you

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:30,010
[Music]

4
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,219
all right

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,399
thank you

6
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,600
first of all welcome

7
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,080
[Music]

8
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,900
um my name is Jennifer Pierce I uh

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,840
M I don't even really know what to call

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,619
myself

11
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,720
I manage a development team that's

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,840
responsible for implementing

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,619
um

14
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,439
new Solutions combining Automation and

15
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,799
AIML so that's what we do I work for one

16
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,479
of the largest fintech companies on the

17
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,000
globe and uh we build stuff that's

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,580
needed based on whatever the request is

19
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,259
and the data available

20
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,240
so one of the things I wanted to

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,640
introduce to you today and I think it's

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,040
things a thing that has a tremendous

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,439
amount of

24
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,020
importance in the security space I'm not

25
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,299
a security person you guys are so you

26
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,040
know I'm counting on you throughout this

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,680
discussion to jump in and tell me if if

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,640
that's accurate or not is really the the

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,740
growing Persistence of virtual

30
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,939
assistants and just about everything

31
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,180
that we use now the the notion of a

32
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,040
chatbot that's not new

33
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,140
it's it's not

34
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,960
um we've used them in fact if I go back

35
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,560
in time to the early 90s walking into TV

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,480
Lenny's American

37
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,459
in the back corner there's the computer

38
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,440
section right and they were still

39
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,620
selling 46s at the time and when you

40
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,379
opened it up a little virtual rendering

41
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,200
of Jean-Luc Picard would talk to you

42
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,360
I mean it was basically like the totally

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,000
mind-blowing version of Clippy

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
and so you know I mean these these are

45
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,860
not new Concepts however

46
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,020
within the last several years we've

47
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,959
combined that new that concept really

48
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,019
with you know the notion of AIML and

49
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,220
being able to save and use

50
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,040
[Music]

51
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,000
come on Betsy

52
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,980
save and use that data for persistent

53
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,420
purposes

54
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,780
so I I'm going to be quite honest I find

55
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,720
chat Bots and virtual assistants

56
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,260
monumentally annoying

57
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,500
whenever I go to a site or or connect to

58
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,260
a business through an IDR and you know

59
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,060
the first thing you do is either walk

60
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,400
you through this this comprehensive

61
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,700
press one for this but of course they

62
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,260
always happen to preface it but you know

63
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,480
on our website you can find the answers

64
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,340
to all your problems well I went there

65
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,680
why do you think I'm calling you

66
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,140
so you know you get the idea that you

67
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,300
know we slowly but surely added these

68
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,640
things into our Estates and our

69
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,800
environments to the point where now they

70
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,440
are in fact a security question

71
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,440
because the world is using them and I'm

72
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,299
going to stand over here because my old

73
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,640
eyes can't read it and these are too far

74
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,480
away

75
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,340
but I'm just going to point out a few

76
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,860
things that you know we need to to

77
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,780
you know pay attention to

78
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,299
you know if anything the number of

79
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,400
businesses the number of applications

80
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,400
that we rely on that use Virtual

81
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,500
assistants has increased exponentially

82
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,420
in the last five years

83
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,780
to the point where just about

84
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,000
trying to think of one that doesn't

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,900
you know if you go to to any uh Fortune

86
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,978
500 companies virtual interface websites

87
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:20,459
kind of a you know not a appropriate way

88
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,740
to describe what these things do you're

89
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,020
going to interact with some form of

90
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,340
virtual assistant

91
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,660
you know it's going to pop up in the

92
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,400
bottom right corner hello I'm whatever

93
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,460
can I help you and you know you close it

94
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,840
because you don't want to talk to that

95
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,540
thing and then it pops up again

96
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,020
close it you know it's it's and I I know

97
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,220
I'm hitting a nerve because there's like

98
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,620
afternoon yeah

99
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,740
so point being it is growing in terms of

100
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,320
utilization in our environment

101
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,360
to the fact that now our average

102
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,180
consumers prefer it

103
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,960
74 of users and consumers for these

104
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,380
companies would rather talk to the bot

105
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,360
before they have to talk to a person

106
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,780
I think

107
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,460
because I don't

108
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,919
you know I've learned actually Mike

109
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,960
getzman who runs this show taught me a

110
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,580
very long time ago that when he called

111
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,100
him it says press one for this press do

112
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,560
just keep hitting zero eventually it

113
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,680
then gives up and sends you to a person

114
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,280
okay but my oldness aside the reality is

115
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,039
is that a large portion of people prefer

116
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:32,880
that

117
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,620
they prefer it for the quick answers

118
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,720
that they don't have to look up

119
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,139
they prefer oftentimes for the ability

120
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,539
to get their problem resolved without

121
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,539
having to re-explain it 10 times as the

122
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,100
company transitions you from Department

123
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,740
to department so there are legitimate

124
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,180
reasons why you may want to look at a

125
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,720
bot in your solution or your business

126
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,880
if I go down and I look at some of the

127
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,380
other statistics

128
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,960
significant return on investment

129
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,300
if time allows at the end of this I will

130
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,259
show you

131
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:08,639
well first of all how many people come

132
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,199
to conferences because you like the swag

133
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:16,620
I do it's cool right in my opinion when

134
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,479
you walk out of any one of these talks

135
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,220
you should have some mental swag to go

136
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,259
with including the ability to implement

137
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,539
what I talked about tomorrow in your

138
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:25,560
business

139
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,199
so if time allows at the end I'll show

140
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,900
you how to very quickly Implement an

141
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,300
AIML driven chat bot in your

142
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,819
organization in probably about 15

143
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:36,960
minutes

144
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,880
now that doesn't mean that it won't take

145
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,440
time to customize it to whatever it is

146
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,080
you do but as far as getting it built

147
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,060
and built for free

148
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,520
that's the easy part

149
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,560
Okay so

150
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,180
what's that

151
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,340
so more and more people continue to use

152
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,580
these products as we expand into our

153
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,080
different environments social media I

154
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,639
don't even really have to talk about it

155
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,880
I mean if you look at our top social

156
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,100
media platforms they all have some form

157
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,560
of messaging system including the

158
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,180
ability to interact with the platform

159
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,800
through it

160
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,440
so from consumer a usage and a social

161
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,060
media perspective

162
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,660
okay they're a very clear reality

163
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,360
taking it a bit further if you look at

164
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
the service space

165
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,500
again it comes down to you know the

166
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,419
ability to reduce costs in your

167
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,520
environment

168
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,620
in essence by reducing the number of

169
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,240
people that need to be able to respond

170
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,340
to questions

171
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,800
I mean how many of you today have within

172
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,819
your organization a segment that uses a

173
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,759
bot to answer simple questions for users

174
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,639
anybody use it

175
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,620
okay

176
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,660
hopefully if I ask you the same question

177
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,979
next year

178
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:57,120
you'll all be able to say oh we do now

179
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,340
okay if you look a step further I

180
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,719
feel like inside of like six

181
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,500
months was it

182
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,319
oh no that's all right it's my own fault

183
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,960
for putting so much text on a slide

184
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,660
which usually I don't do

185
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,300
um probably one of the most powerful

186
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,879
pieces is in the voice section one step

187
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,840
down that says 43 percent of users

188
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,919
between the ages of 16 and 64 are using

189
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,958
voice command

190
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,020
peripherals in their environment

191
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,520
I get

192
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,880
the age 14 side of it

193
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,779
I'm a little shocked at the 64 sideways

194
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:49,440
so I'll give you a one example one of

195
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,779
the pieces in my company is a a Voice

196
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:55,200
driven interactive UI for current

197
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,660
company statistics where you can sit

198
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,180
down talk to it and say how is this

199
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,279
particular application doing today and

200
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,899
it will give you the answer

201
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,519
and I remember when it was first demo to

202
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,019
me I looked at it I thought who's going

203
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,360
to do that

204
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,519
in front of their computer and and talk

205
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,100
to it to get the answer when I could

206
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,779
type it while I'm typing 12 other things

207
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,580
probably faster and I won't have to

208
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,880
rephrase it so that it understands it

209
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,880
apparently again I'm old

210
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,700
because there is a large and growing

211
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,560
population that will use it to the point

212
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,380
that eventually it will be one of the

213
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,540
preferred mechanisms for interacting

214
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,459
with others interacting with service

215
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,680
providers and providing service to

216
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,099
customers

217
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,920
if you take another step further

218
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,899
[Music]

219
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,480
oh that's my favorite one

220
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,420
73 of Health Care Providers say that

221
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,940
they can better serve and diagnose

222
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,420
ailments using AIML including using it

223
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,060
through interactive Bots that doctors

224
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,160
nurses and other practitioners can use

225
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,500
that too you know kind of amazing that

226
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,500
AIML is going to drive the way they

227
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,019
prescribe medication and determine when

228
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,180
where and how you'll use it

229
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,100
so ultimately

230
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,500
when you look at all of these statistics

231
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,279
the the general overall answer is that

232
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,640
utilization of intelligent Bots is

233
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,620
increasing it's increasing in both

234
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,800
frequency velocity as well as its user

235
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,959
base whereas

236
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,060
the age of the user used to be the

237
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,680
determining factor and the types of

238
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,440
Technologies they use this is one that

239
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,360
seems to transcend that because we all

240
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,920
talk

241
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,500
and we all interact with others now

242
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,320
here's the key Gap and the key Gap is is

243
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,740
where all of these different functions

244
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,300
struggle and it's where the function

245
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,760
that I'm going to show you later doesn't

246
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,600
and it's the simple fact that most of

247
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,600
these still today are very rule driven

248
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,519
models

249
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,339
you ask this therefore I give you this

250
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:09,779
answer

251
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,720
you ask this I don't know what you asked

252
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,300
therefore I ask you to repeat it

253
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,040
and if I have to ask you to repeat it

254
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,839
more than three times I'm going to say

255
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,399
I'm sorry I don't understand let me get

256
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,320
you to a person

257
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,899
okay these are pretty simple if then

258
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,480
algorithms that you know most of us can

259
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,570
develop

260
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,839
[Music]

261
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,019
so as most of our companies grow in

262
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,700
global popularity

263
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,220
we have to deal with the fact that not

264
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,160
everyone asks the same question in the

265
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,300
same way

266
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,220
tent is the same

267
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,040
and I'll give you an example

268
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,500
and in one of my implementations of a

269
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,399
bot

270
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,399
I had a relatively simple set of

271
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,019
algorithms that allowed a person to

272
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,779
check the performance metrics of their

273
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,720
environment from system to system

274
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,959
component to you know interactivity with

275
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,240
other systems Etc you know through the

276
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,820
bot in other words how's the performance

277
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,560
of my system

278
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,500
and when I showcase this to the team you

279
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,180
know I typed in okay how's the

280
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,640
performance of system abc123 XYZ you

281
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,040
know some random system and it went back

282
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,019
in and it attached to multiple different

283
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:24,360
systems it aggregated the data in the

284
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,339
back end and it came back with a

285
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,560
response and a grade and you know

286
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,360
ultimately how it didn't derived that

287
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,399
grade okay

288
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,500
the cool part was all the algorithms at

289
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,060
the back end not so much the interface

290
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,760
in my opinion but you know the reality

291
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,620
is is that I programmed it to understand

292
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,899
what the word performance means

293
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:44,639
when somebody asks for performance do

294
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,470
this

295
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,680
[Music]

296
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,120
you know my team was like well yeah

297
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,160
that's kind of nice okay cool

298
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,380
you know then I went back and I typed in

299
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,660
OMG

300
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,040
my app is crazy slow with about 12 A's

301
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,740
in it WTF

302
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,060
[Music]

303
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,740
and they all laugh because they figure

304
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,480
out screw him around

305
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,260
it came back with a 98 certainty that

306
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,480
this was a performance based question

307
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,279
and therefore took it down the

308
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,200
performance path

309
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,959
so being able to isolate the intent

310
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,620
based on Sample data of the inputs is is

311
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,639
a critical piece that takes you from

312
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,740
can I help you find where the status of

313
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,019
your shipment is

314
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,940
to actually being able to understand

315
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,579
your intent understand your problem and

316
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,380
ultimately guide you through a solution

317
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,240
from end to end

318
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,880
okay that's the difference

319
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,399
some companies do it that's why those

320
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,839
numbers go up

321
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,420
and but not everyone does and so I'm

322
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,579
going to show you one possible solution

323
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,190
to that problem

324
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,800
[Music]

325
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,060
but in order to do that

326
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,899
we we need to kind of talk about the

327
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,180
security implications of this

328
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,940
you know my question is you know if any

329
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,560
of you are on development teams you live

330
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,260
in the world of develop because you

331
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,899
should not because you can

332
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,339
how many of you ever bought a tool

333
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,480
that's got like 87 features you use four

334
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,940
okay because nobody asked you that other

335
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,860
garbage that you put in there I mean

336
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,100
yeah I get it you can do it but why

337
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,680
why would you do it

338
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,019
so as we look at this we have to think

339
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,959
to ourselves all right is it from a

340
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,720
security perspective wise

341
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,300
to expand the use of these types of

342
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,800
solutions because there's certain

343
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,579
inherent implications that people expect

344
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:48,120
those 16 to 64s when you add a bot to

345
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,800
your user experience

346
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,120
you know number one

347
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,279
did do people really like are they all

348
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,440
that questioning of what data they pump

349
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,180
into a body

350
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,220
your assumption is is that the bot is

351
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,980
benevolent it is a machine

352
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,279
the machine does not wish you ill will

353
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,860
so therefore tell me your mother's

354
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,279
maiden name

355
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,700
would you hesitate

356
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,199
[Music]

357
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,519
okay

358
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,740
so you know it comes back then the the

359
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,180
Assumption then is also you know the

360
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,820
body's dumb

361
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,500
you know that's the general assumption

362
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,980
okay it's not thinking

363
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,880
it's just simply ingesting data

364
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,220
comparing it to whatever data source it

365
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,959
has and if it has some sort of match

366
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,639
giving it a match

367
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,940
okay the assumption is the Box don't

368
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,519
that that when you're done

369
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,800
everything you pumped into it including

370
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,560
WTF at the end of my statement

371
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,380
is now gone

372
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,079
November is the the assumption that you

373
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,639
know

374
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,590
it's it's

375
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,820
[Music]

376
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,620
unfamiliar with unstructured inputs

00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,660
you know I just gave you an example

378
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,540
okay you if you're really a pissed off

379
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,519
system admin

380
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,560
and you go to my bot

381
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,019
and you type what I describe and

382
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,120
actually get an answer

383
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,860
I mean it probably knocked him out of

384
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,940
his chair

385
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,620
because he didn't really expect an

386
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,600
answer he's just really mad

387
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,639
and and this is one of the ways he's

388
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,500
expressing that anger

389
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,779
you know just like me hitting the zero

390
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,940
button every time I get on one of those

391
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,050
automated calls

392
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,300
[Music]

393
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,339
the assumption is the bot doesn't know

394
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:39,959
what you're doing

395
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:40,770
well

396
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,000
[Music]

397
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,820
with AIML and other additions to it it

398
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,980
certainly can

399
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,720
you know and then and then there's

400
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,180
always you know the the you think of

401
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,060
social engineering as being one of the

402
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,339
tenements of information security

403
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,139
you know and we always think of it from

404
00:16:58,139 --> 00:16:59,940
the perspective of

405
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,920
going up to the administrative assistant

406
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,559
going hi I'm here from I.T I'm here he

407
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,540
just called me he's really mad but he's

408
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,730
gone do you know his password

409
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,500
[Music]

410
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,140
you know the assistant's like oh I'm not

411
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,839
sure okay but if I gotta go down it's

412
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,220
gonna take me another 10 minutes to come

413
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,599
back and I'm sure he's gonna be really

414
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,640
upset at that point

415
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,040
well okay

416
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,079
you know our assumption is is that you

417
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,780
know you need a person to do that

418
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,940
well what if the bot asks you all the

419
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,040
right questions

420
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,860
I need help with password recovery

421
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,919
okay what's your username here it is

422
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,299
okay

423
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:43,260
um in order to verify who you are I'm

424
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,700
going to ask you a series of security

425
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,240
questions

426
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,580
that's what the guy on the phone would

427
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,820
do

428
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,100
only the guy in the phone's memory isn't

429
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,299
all that great

430
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,340
because he's old like me in 10 minutes

431
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,539
he doesn't even know what he's doing

432
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:07,020
here okay the bot nose and the bot can

433
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,179
retain it for years and years and years

434
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:11,539
and years

435
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,820
so there are serious and specific

436
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,360
security implications when we talk about

437
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,940
adding additional virtual assistants

438
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,860
particularly complex virtual assistants

439
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,299
to your environment

440
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,480
so at the end of the day when I show you

441
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,460
how to build one in 10 minutes and you

442
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,440
think to yourself but maybe maybe you

443
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,820
think I don't care or maybe you think

444
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,470
this is cool

445
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,340
[Music]

446
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,120
you now have have done two things

447
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,880
you've created an input mechanism and a

448
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,280
long-term storage mechanism for

449
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,679
structured and unstructured user data

450
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,559
based on how you taught your Bot to lead

451
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,900
the discussion

452
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,539
and you have also now become the crowd

453
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:57,179
owner and fully responsible

454
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,240
for having that data in your possession

455
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,620
sounds kind of like in the state of

456
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,299
Wisconsin if they find a lock pick set

457
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,039
in your car unless you can demonstrate a

458
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,260
legitimate reason to have it

459
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,960
um you know you have the potential of of

460
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,080
drawing charges

461

[Music]

462
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,880
so you've now collected passwords and

463
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,100
security information for half your staff

464
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,860
and you're retaining it for long ranges

465
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,059
of time

466
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,460
you better be able to explain why it's

467
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,600
appropriate that you have that

468
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,059
so if we take it a step further

469
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,320
there's certain key Concepts

470
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,360
that if you're going to go down this

471
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,480
path or if you're going to be the

472
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,580
security person on the other end of this

473
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,299
path trying to ensure that people are

474
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:52,620
not creating data sets of critical data

475
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,500
without any sort of governance

476
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,900
there's six key or eight key Concepts

477
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,700
that you have to understand

478
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,520
okay and if you know these already then

479
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,679
great but I'm going to share a little

480
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,299
bit about each just so we're all on the

481
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:07,559
same page

482
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,160
at the very root of of a modern virtual

483
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,240
assistant

484
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,100
and if you talk to people who develop

485
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,559
these and you say the word chat bot they

486
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,059
get this I want to punch you in the face

487
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:19,679
look you know you haven't seen that

488
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,400
thing

489
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,160
you know and it's mainly because they've

490
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,740
evolved so far beyond the rule-driven

491
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,140
type of utility that we're accustomed to

492
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,760
okay and and the reason they've done

493
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,260
that is is something called natural

494
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,840
language understanding and I want to

495
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,220
make sure there's a clear delineation

496
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,620
between natural language processing and

497
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,780
natural language understanding natural

498
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,580
language processing

499
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,799
is the the algorithm and set of

500
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,140
algorithms that allow you to take an

501
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,799
input tokenize that input clean it from

502
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,620
whatever irrelevant terminology that is

503
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,679
needed and then use that to analyze the

504
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,660
intents and and the other you know

505
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,820
requirements that you need okay the

506
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,860
natural language processing it's it's in

507
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,559
the word processing you said this

508
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,380
sentence and I tore it apart into its

509
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,360
only its most important pieces and I

510
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,400
compared it to other data sets to try

511
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,440
and determine if it's relevant or

512
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,460
important

513
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,280
natural language understanding

514
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,860
is taking that a step further

515
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,740
by giving you the ability to use that

516
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,200
natural language processing in

517
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,280
conjunction

518
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,580
with multiple other models that are

519
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,380
available to you

520
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,600
so I'll give you two examples if you're

521
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,000
going to take text-based endpoint or

522
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,159
voice based input the solution I'll show

523
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,500
you later can do both that doesn't care

524
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,240
if you're going to take this type of

525
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,980
input

526
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,500
you're going to get things that the

527
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,039
average NLP solution doesn't understand

528
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:53,039
okay my name is John plotice

529
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,980
okay I I love my last name because no

530
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,240
one has it

531
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,400
is real easy like in college you know

532
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,260
they go down the list Bob Smith Mike

533
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,900
Jones John

534
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,100
and I just raised my hand go yeah that's

535
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,480
me

536
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,960
okay but share it with a bot it's going

537
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,140
to remove it as gibberish

538
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,780
I mean right it's not a known word

539
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,820
unless you're Latvian then it's another

540
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,820
word okay it's it's it's irrelevant

541
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,760
however for our purposes it happens to

542
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,020
be very relevant because I'm going to

543
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,120
correlate that with the username and and

544
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,340
ultimately drive it to resolution

545
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,580
but an NLP alone won't do that the

546
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,460
merger of NLP was Spacey Spacey being

547
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,020
another solution that helps you

548
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,799
extrapolate names is going to do that

549
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,679
dates are another prime example if

550
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,840
you're in the UK

551
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,539
you format your dates in one way if

552
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:49,919
you're in the U.S you format them

553
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,440
another way if you're an absolute Unix

554
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,640
nerd

555
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,159
you format formulate your dates in that

556
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,380
giant eunuch string and then try and

557
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,720
think about that great day in 1970 as

558
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,980
you try and bring it back to a normal

559
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,240
date

560
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,880
okay so dates are another one doubling

561
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,340
is another model you add to natural

562
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,380
language processing specifically

563
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,440
designed to parse dates so

564
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,200
when you think about it NLP and NLP

565
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,260
alone isn't sufficient to do a whole lot

566
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,059
in fact the last time I gave a speech

567
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:24,720
here I used NLP to analyze Trump's

568
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,799
speeches

569
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,140
and and identify

570
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,900
um intent and sentiment across various

571
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,059
different Trump speeches

572
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,580
it was great it came back with a result

573
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,400
the result even got kind of a chuckle

574
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,640
but to what end it really didn't give me

575
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,400
anything that I could use

576
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,640
in another effort so so always think

577
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,659
about that natural language

578
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,280
understanding versus natural language

579
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,460
processing very different intense and

580
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,919
intent processing

581
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,780
to something that nlu is used

582
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,179
specifically for the ability to take

583
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:03,179
whatever you put in

584
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:06,900
and determine what the likelihood of

585
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,179
what you just said is to a certain

586
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:10,440
intent

587
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,120
okay the most simple ones are happier

588
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,559
sad

589
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,200
just use your happier set

590
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,900
if if the user starts off with hey how

591
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,980
you doing

592
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,900
it's probably happening

593
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,679
if it starts off with damn it

594
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,480
it's probably not

595
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,940
okay so the intelligent method to use

596
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,059
intense to draw your user down a

597
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,820
different path you as a developer have

598
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,320
to be able to number one understand

599
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,659
relevant intense for your particular use

600
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:40,919
case

601
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,039
and give the model enough training data

602
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,720
to be able to understand it when other

603
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,440
people use it

604
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,539
I have a guy that works for me he's a

605
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,640
PhD in statistics he's my data science

606
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,320
manager

607
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,179
and and every time I say the word

608
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:58,799
artificial intelligence he gets this

609
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,260
kind of nervous tick

610
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,659
because it's all math

611
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:07,320
and if there's nothing particularly

612
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,840
artificial or intelligent about it it's

613
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,360
just your ability to attack any new

614
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,340
problem with the right sequence of

615
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,960
mathematical steps

616
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,460
so

617
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,440
think about that entities and Slots

618
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,179
these are particularly relevant to the

619
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:24,380
solution I'll show you in a little bit

620
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,700
intense entities and slots

621
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,980
are in essence the intelligent

622
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,620
mechanism's way of extracting relevant

623
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,840
data from what you said even if you had

624
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,380
no intent of giving them that data

625
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,980
when I say I want you to extract the

626
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,539
mother's maiden name

627
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,700
you know I could just ask you what's

628
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,159
your mother's maiden name or you know I

629
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,200
could ask you in a different way you

630
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,840
know uh was your mother married

631
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,539
no what was your name you know I mean

632
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:02,220
you could think of a dozen ways to get

633
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,779
that data out without asking it directly

634
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,299
custom actions are the power behind all

635
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:10,320
of it because you know you can collect

636
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,360
all this data but what do you do with it

637
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,980
again the solution I'm going to show you

638
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,500
it's called rasa

639
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,080
rasa is an open source uh virtual

640
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,880
assistant solution I selected it for

641
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,320
this particular discussion because

642
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,440
number one it is open source it's

643
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,299
readily available they have extensive

644
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:29,100
documentation it's actively being

645
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,279
developed and if you go online they've

646
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,500
taken every key process and they've

647
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,559
built video tutorials around them so as

648
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,299
far as you having to try and figure out

649
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,340
how it works they've gone out of their

650
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,640
way to make it easy including a UI for

651
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,299
um

652
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:49,080
just uh um conversation driven design

653
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,960
the idea being is that you may ask it

654
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,700
one way you may ask it another way you

655
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,900
may ask in a way I've never even heard

656
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,760
of you may ask it seven different ways

657
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,320
each time you visit

658
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,299
and using conversation driven design

659
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:02,039
that Aggregates at all on the back end

660
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:05,100
and it uses that to learn so when that

661
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,960
conversation is done today the buck got

662
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,419
a tiny bit smarter

663
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,880
and the next five times it gets a little

664
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,640
bit smarter after that

665
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,400
so custom actions is a python back end

666
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,559
that allows you to take the data input

667
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:20,880
your entities

668
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,980
as variables and then feed that into

669
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,380
whatever type of action you want

670
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,140
it may be the username and password go

671
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,779
into an authentication script and come

672
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,940
back with the user's profile

673
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,820
you know I mean take your pick

674
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,640
stories

675
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,340
every every bot solution that you have

676
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,520
has behind it the notion of a story

677
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,159
because again to my data scientist

678
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:49,260
nervous twitch the machine's not that

679
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,279
smart

680
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:54,419
it's it can only know what it knows and

681
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,179
so you as a human have to start to give

682
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,820
it stories to look at so that it can

683
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,740
understand what to do with them

684
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,679
rules are a bit more strict than stories

685
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,159
in the fact that a story can change as

686
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,559
the conversation changes you may have

687
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,539
started talking about a performance

688
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:15,480
issue but then well if my performance is

689
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,520
in the tank and I need more CPU then it

690
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,260
becomes a capacity starting

691
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,100
then it becomes a security story as you

692
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,559
try to provide parameters to A system

693
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,200
that are in violation of corporate

694
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,220
policy

695
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,740
see all of these different paths can go

696
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,140
down depending on the story that you

697
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,480
give it rules are different

698
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,120
rules are stagnant they're static you

699
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,980
cannot deviate from them without

700
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,799
changing the entire intent

701
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:46,080
policies and models are really where the

702
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,820
secret sauce is the solution I'll show

703
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,100
you has a tensorflow back end that

704
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,440
allows it to process real-time and large

705
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,840
amounts of data with a relatively small

706
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,299
footprint and what it does is that every

707
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,640
time it learns a new input it relearns

708
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,720
and rebuilds its model

709
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:06,440
all right

710
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,279
so One Last Thing Before I actually show

711
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,779
it to you and I like to break this into

712
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:15,000
two pieces because some people like to

713
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,520
to hear the talk and some people like to

714
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,260
do the Hands-On piece and see how it

715
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,520
works

716
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,460
um so I usually pause after the talk and

717
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,020
then answer any questions and then we

718
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,539
can go into the Hands-On piece

719
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:29,460
and I see that we are still in good

720
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,419
shape so again rasa is only one and I

721
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:36,659
have no particular affiliation or

722
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:40,380
interest in rasa more than any other one

723
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,960
however I did select it here because of

724
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,940
its availability to anyone who wants to

725
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,919
use it because it is entirely open

726
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,179
source

727
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:50,520
it has a well-defined but customizable

728
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,260
structure

729
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,960
based on yaml in the back end and simple

730
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,960
yaml syntax you can create and expand

731
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,799
your Bot on the fly or Over time however

732
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,000
you choose to do and I'll show you what

733
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,559
that looks like in a minute

734
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,240
again strong online community

735
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,440
every one of my developers has three

736
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,520
screens

737
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,919
they have two screens for development

738
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,520
and then one screen just to do research

739
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,380
because how many times throughout the

740
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,240
day do you have to Google something

741
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,460
you know I mean it's just a reality the

742
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,220
days of having a you know a c developer

743
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,159
who knows C in and out and can answer

744
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:31,620
any question that's just gone you know

745
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,059
now

746
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:35,039
I have been seasoned developers that

747
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,000
even before

748
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,679
the line of code they go Google it

749
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,779
anyway make sure they're doing it right

750
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:43,380
right so you know huge online community

751
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,960
they're rasa docs and video tutorials

752
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,659
are quite extensive and then everything

753
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,200
under it is open source as well

754
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,779
so if your company is like many

755
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:56,940
companies looking for more

756
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,940
cost-effective and supportable solutions

757
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,279
open source is one of the areas that

758
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,799
they like to move for two reasons first

759
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,480
of all everyone assumes open source is

760
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,059
free that's just not true okay there's

761
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:11,220
portions of it are free this is free you

762
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,380
can develop it all you want if you want

763
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,000
any sort of Enterprise support of course

764
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,440
you know that's where they make their

765
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,820
money

766
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,740
um so that's one part and then the

767
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,080
second part is its maintainability

768
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,299
okay if I get hit by a truck tomorrow I

769
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,100
like to see if I win the lottery you

770
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,140
know basically if I get hit by a truck I

771
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,120
get hit by a truck tomorrow there is

772
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,860
absolutely no reason development cannot

773
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,520
continue with dozens of other users that

774
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,840
can be brought in to support it

775
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,779
they do have a UI if you choose

776
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:45,299
again you know just because I'm old you

777
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:46,620
know I prefer to work on the command

778
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,899
line but you know there are people that

779
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:51,000
prefer the UI

780
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,080
um and everything's based on

781
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,059
conversation driven design that's in

782
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:56,220
fact a huge point for the company as a

783
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,240
whole

784
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,059
doing it once is an instant failure

785
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:01,559
because the minute you train your model

786
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:04,260
in 10 minutes of toll

787
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,840
okay it's it cannot stand the test of

788
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,360
time without extensive maintenance so

789
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,360
your utility needs to learn

790
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,760
okay cannot rely on you to tell it what

791
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,100
to look for if it does

792
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,380
well it kind of didn't really solve your

793
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,179
problem because you need just as many

794
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:22,980
people to maintain it as you would to

795
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,520
answer the phone

796
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,600
and then of course it supports key

797
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,760
Integrations out of the box

798
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,399
so if you want to have your UI built

799
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,260
into your company's slacking environment

800
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,039
that's a real simple right on the box

801
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,299
built-in or you want to integrated with

802
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,460
teams where you can call up the botlet

803
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,919
you can call up any peer okay all of

804
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,860
these pieces are in place and capable

805
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,020
um relatively simple and it does support

806
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,880
those key models that I was describing

807
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,120
before

808
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:55,919
okay

809
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,919
so I am going to change menus and I'm

810
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:01,120
going to go around here because

811
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,229
[Music]

812
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:20,730
[Music]

813
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,630
all right

814
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,260
[Music]

815
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,700
so I'm going to walk through a few key

816
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,620
pieces so if you really do have an

817
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,899
interest in implementing this

818
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:35,700
then I'm going to share with you how

819
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,460
it's done so that you can walk out of

820
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,260
here tomorrow sit at a table and build

821
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,399
your own

822
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:44,760
okay so rasa if you go to rasa.org and

823
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,200
you want to get started

824
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,360
rasa is a very simple I mean it's all

825
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,580
python-based so you're going to start by

826
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,140
creating a virtual environment you're

827
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,000
going to go ahead and pip install rasa

828
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,039
and it's going to install all the

829
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,200
updated dependencies for you

830
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,480
following that it's a simple rasa init

831
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,039
command and that will create everything

832
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,080
that you see right here in front of you

833
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,779
in a well-structured easy to understand

834
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,280
format

835
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,659
I'm going to kind of walk you through

836
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,760
some of the key files that you need to

837
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,219
understand in order to be able to to

838
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,099
create a solution quickly and the

839
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,440
solution I'm going to show you today I

840
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,179
did while I was drinking my coffee this

841
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,619
morning because you know I thought hey

842
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:25,260
probably be good to have what I know

843
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,339
works

844
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:27,659
so

845
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:30,899
I think it took me all of 15 minutes

846
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:34,619
to create a recover my password bot

847
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,000
okay now it doesn't mean it's perfect

848
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,918
doesn't mean it's got any custom actions

849
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,659
but in terms of the discussion

850
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,339
I can walk you through that simple

851
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:43,560
dialogue right here you know relatively

852
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,080
quickly so when you when you initiate

853
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,949
your rasa bot

854
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,659
[Music]

855
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:51,179
it's going to pre-load certain critical

856
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,239
files that you will manipulate as you

857
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,040
begin to build the solution

858
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,260
okay so at the root of it

859
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,200
is it's data and I'll talk about that in

860
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,460
a minute

861
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,220
its domain

862
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,220
and it's config now there are others and

863
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,200
I'll tell you that a vast majority of

864
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,700
people you know you can get up and

865
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,079
functional without manipulating the

866
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,400
others

867
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,619
the center of the Bots world is the

868
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:19,500
domain and that's what you see here

869
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,079
the domain is everything it knows

870
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,700
and if it's not in the domain it doesn't

871
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,900
know it

872
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,359
the domain includes a whole group of

873
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,980
intents that you've created and I'll

874
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,000
show you where those are in just a

875
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,240
second the default intents include you

876
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,280
know are you happy are you sad Etc

877
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,980
usually I just strip those things out

878
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,540
but you'll notice that on the bottom

879
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,160
I've got two that are not password

880
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,619
recovery and Recovery info

881
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,720
are too intense that you had to create

882
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,760
in order to make this password recovery

883
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,500
component work

884
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,560
under that is your data now these are

885
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,300
your slots your slots are stored in

886
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,940
memory and this is that retention that

887
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,280
we talked about earlier your ability to

888
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,240
be able to ask your end user questions

889
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,820
that again they may not even know why

890
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,040
you're asking but again the Bots aren't

891
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,520
bad so you might as well tell it

892
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,599
you know

893
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,520
what's your favorite restaurant what

894
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,180
city was your dad born in

895
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,400
these are all things that share but you

896
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,320
know it's not like the bot's gonna go

897
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,599
tell anyone right

898
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,700
so you've got all these components that

899
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,900
you're going to add and you're going to

900
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,480
store them in slots slots is that piece

901
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,640
of memory that that particular bit of

902
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,960
information is going to be stored until

903
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,320
you choose to put it elsewhere

904
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,420
the ones that I've selected or I put in

905
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,880
is Mother's maid name uh your favorite

906
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,160
restaurant and your username and and

907
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,380
there is no limit

908
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,119
to the number

909
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,579
and they are persistent throughout the

910
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,700
duration of the session with the user so

911
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,680
if the person comes back it you will

912
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,180
never have to ask them their username

913
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,079
again

914
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,560
okay it will maintain it

915
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,240
below that

916
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,400
if you choose you can create forms I

917
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,859
created one just to make it simple

918
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,900
and what forms do is they intelligently

919
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,560
keep asking you until the slot is full

920
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,960
so for instance you know if you

921
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,940
magically evade the mother's maiden name

922
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,579
it will not let you proceed until that

923
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:23,420
slot is full

924
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,880
and then there's all your responses your

925
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,320
responses can come in the form of

926
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,900
freeform text you can have responses as

927
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,359
images links you can send them out to a

928
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,800
video you can route them to a different

929
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,599
location your response is really up to

930
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:37,380
you

931
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,599
okay but it has the ability to take all

932
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,820
of those pieces

933
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,920
and output this in the form of an

934
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,480
intelligent conversation with the end

935
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,099
user which it's also tracking and

936
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,960
learning in the backing

937
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,119
so that's your domain if you don't leave

938
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,680
any with any other bit of information

939
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,800
yet you really want to give this a shot

940
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,300
your domain is going to be everything

941
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,980
your Bot knows

942
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,599
okay

943
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:02,820
how does your Bot use it is the other

944
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,440
question and that comes in the form of

945
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,540
data and actions

946
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,060
your data is broken out into three

947
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,260
pieces your natural language

948
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,420
understanding as we described your

949
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,160
stories and your rules

950
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,180
so if you look at the sample data that I

951
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,940
gave them again to my data science

952
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,520
manager's credit and his nervous twitch

953
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,320
okay no matter how intelligent you think

954
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,240
the machine is it's not

955
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,640
okay you have to give it something to

956
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,780
model huh

957
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,880
so in this case I've given it some

958
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,940
samples to build its model

959
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,060
okay so if somebody says I need my

960
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,040
password reset the bot doesn't know what

961
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,400
that means until you give it enough data

962
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,200
points to discover

963
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,839
through its natural language processing

964
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:51,560
that the combination of these tokens

965
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,130
equals I want my password reset

966
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,440
[Music]

967
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,359
so I've given it some samples I think I

968
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,339
forgot my password I forgot my password

969
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,460
can you help me recover my password

970
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:06,599
forgot password password recovery and

971
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:09,839
a good collection a Minimum Collection

972
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,640
of samples is two

973
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,440
if you wanted to do anything it needs at

974
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,240
least two that's not going to be very

975
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,920
intelligent

976
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,339
an optimal example or set which we've

977
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:22,500
discovered is usually around a hundred

978
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,599
now sometimes there isn't 100 ways to

979
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:25,859
ask a question

980
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:28,920
and you know then that is what it is but

981
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,900
that's where the the learning piece of

982
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,960
this comes in because I may not know the

983
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,599
87th way to ask to pass the reset my

984
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:38,640
password it could be something along the

985
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,740
lines of my damn password don't work

986
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,919
again

987
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,720
put it in there

988
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,180
it will begin to learn and then as other

989
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,400
people continue to use it it's

990
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,440
identified the tokens and it starts to

991
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,320
learn it without you putting in it

992
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,240
and then there's the whole recovery

993
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,700
information side okay

994
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,880
my bot doesn't know

995
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,160
Bill underscore Smith

996
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,140
that's that's gibberish

997
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,020
it it would discard it even though

998
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,720
Spacey is plugged into this bot

999
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,640
Spacey doesn't know what Bill underscore

1000
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,839
Smith is

1001
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,940
because I've added the underscore yeah

1002
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,359
[Music]

1003
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:27,660
oh being loaded yeah yeah I'll actually

1004
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,820
get to that in a second so we'll look at

1005
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,220
that in the config piece

1006
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,240
um but you'll notice that I've

1007
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,480
designated samples for username mother's

1008
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,339
maiden name and and my favorite

1009
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:40,380
restaurant is not McDonald's but I was

1010
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,420
too lazy to type anything longer

1011
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,820
okay so I've given it enough to be able

1012
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,740
to say all right if I type in I love

1013
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,720
McDonald's it knows what I'm talking

1014
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,800
about

1015
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,760
now to your question

1016
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,040
the default models

1017
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,140
are in your config

1018
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,000
and right now I'm just using the default

1019
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,619
models themselves now one of the

1020
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:04,079
interesting things about uh rasa

1021
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,640
themselves is they use a diet

1022
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,040
architecture

1023
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,079
which is how they're able to merge the

1024
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,599
multiple models and and allow you to

1025
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:14,160
pick and choose almost like the salad

1026
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,099
bar so if you don't do anything the

1027
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,079
models loaded are on the top you've got

1028
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,480
your white space tokenizer red regex

1029
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,760
featurizer you know you've got your

1030
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,400
various vectoring features Etc all of

1031
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,900
which then become processed through the

1032
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,960
diet classifier and they even have you

1033
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,240
know fallback intelligence if it really

1034
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,440
doesn't understand what you're talking

1035
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,619
about

1036
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,099
just to finish that out credentials you

1037
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,960
know if you need to to load credentials

1038
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,400
for it if you need to attach it to

1039
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,260
something you can do it there as well as

1040
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,780
activate your endpoints

1041
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,359
the second most powerful part of it

1042
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,560
so you got your natural language

1043
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,599
understanding I gave it enough to try

1044
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,220
and figure out what somebody might tell

1045
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,119
it

1046
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,800
and then I've taken it a step further

1047
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,320
and I've said hey

1048
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,060
when somebody asks for that

1049
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,320
oh

1050
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,079
I did it in rules excuse me when

1051
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,240
somebody asks for that here's what I

1052
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,980
want you to do with it because it'll

1053
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,500
retain the data and go thank you

1054
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,780
mother's maiden name is Jones okay

1055
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,099
thanks

1056
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:21,540
but if you want to actually do anything

1057
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,760
with it you have to give it a storyline

1058
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,200
so you can see this one right here

1059
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,260
activate password form so I created a

1060
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,400
form that's going to make you tell me

1061
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,960
all the information I want otherwise I

1062
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,060
won't talk to you and then I will retain

1063
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,339
that information in my slots

1064
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:37,800
so once I've done all this

1065
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,360
just give me one second

1066
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,280
[Music]

1067
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,880
ah

1068
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,620
I'm used to old-fashioned keyboard

1069
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:00,719
[Music]

1070
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,160
next thing I'm going to do is I'm going

1071
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,440
to train my model

1072
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,570
[Music]

1073
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,260
and what it's going to do is going to

1074
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,359
take any new features new input new Etc

1075
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:14,700
and I'm going to force it to learn it

1076
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,380
and so it's going to go through and it's

1077
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,420
going to build out multiple different

1078
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,660
models and it's going to retain it

1079
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:25,020
in the models folder

1080
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,800
and this is its its training data

1081
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,380
so it's taken it it's learned it and

1082
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,599
it's built its model so now anything you

1083
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,760
throw choose to throw at it it's going

1084
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,680
to compare it to that existing model

1085
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,240
takes just a second

1086
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,800
most of it is just sticking to what I

1087
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,400
already taught it

1088
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,380
okay and you'll notice that it saved my

1089
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,720
model and if you go into the models

1090
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,280
folder

1091
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,680
that's the most recent one which you can

1092
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,020
see at the very bottom

1093
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,780
now you'll notice there's multiple

1094
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,579
and there's multiple because it's

1095
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:07,680
referencing prior models just as much as

1096
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,260
it's reference in current models to make

1097
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,140
sure that as it continues to learn it's

1098
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,020
it's using what it's learned and in

1099
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,000
essence validating it against prior

1100
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,480
learnings

1101
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,680
so let's see if it works

1102
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,359
if you were to use rasa X

1103
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,180
you could do all this through a UI

1104
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,579
but I'm not so I'm doing it through the

1105
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:33,660
command line and what I've just

1106
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,099
initiated is What's called the

1107
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:36,359
interactive mode

1108
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,220
so it's going to walk me through my

1109
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,660
discussion but it's also going to tell

1110
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,859
me if it's collecting the right

1111
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:42,540
information and you'll be able to see

1112
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,359
the slots fill up as we talk to them and

1113
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,560
it's going to be a short discussion

1114
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,579
what it does whenever you go in

1115
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:52,380
interactive it does a retrain on the

1116
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,020
model so we'll give it another second

1117
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,900
it's a differential training so it's not

1118
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,460
doing it all it's just checking for

1119
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,839
anything that's changed since the last

1120
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:03,619
time I was recorded

1121
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,119
[Music]

1122
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:13,319
all right

1123
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:15,060
so you can see the input at the very

1124
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,680
bottom of the screen it's probably kind

1125
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,960
of hard to see I apologize

1126
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,900
and I'm gonna start with hey

1127
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,520
and it's going to tell me well I think

1128
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,500
your intent is to greet

1129
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,839
yeah I think he's right

1130
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,839
okay so and then it's going to say well

1131
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,700
whenever somebody greets me I'm not rude

1132
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,140
I'm going to greet them back

1133
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,119
and you can see right up here it said

1134
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:37,260
all right

1135
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,599
hey how are you

1136
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,700
and then it's going to listen

1137
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:46,640
and I would say I think I forgot

1138
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,140
my password

1139
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,520
and it's going to say the intent is

1140
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,200
password recovery which is absolutely

1141
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,359
correct in fact you'll notice up here

1142
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,599
it's 100 positive that it's password

1143
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:03,119
recovery if I had said something along

1144
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,800
the lines of my darn password doesn't

1145
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,180
work

1146
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,099
it would have got it just the same but

1147
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:11,040
it would have been like 97 98 positive

1148
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,560
okay but because I spit into it exactly

1149
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,540
the phrase in my training data it came

1150
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,240
back with 100 going yep that's it

1151
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,640
I know

1152
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,140
all right so it's going to kick off the

1153
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,520
password form and it's going to say you

1154
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,140
can see right here can you tell me your

1155
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,520
username

1156
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,740
sure my username

1157
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,119
[Music]

1158
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:32,579
is Bill

1159
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:34,800
Jenkins

1160
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,040
[Music]

1161
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,720
and you'll notice at the bottom it said

1162
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,339
all right now mind you to the average

1163
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:43,500
user they're not seeing any of this this

1164
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,940
is just a development but you can see

1165
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,720
it's correctly said okay Bill Jenkins is

1166
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,400
your username and I'm going to store

1167
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,119
that information

1168
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,099
so Bill that's great

1169
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:58,619
so I got one of my slots can you to

1170
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,300

1174
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:21,540
[Music]

1175
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:25,020
nope it did not like Smith

1176
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,560
here

1177
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,619
baby the name was

1178
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,319
just cheat and say um

1179
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:39,780
say one I had already put in there

1180
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,940
her maiden name was because I don't have

1181
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,980
Spacey running directly

1182
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,640
they're maiden name was Janice Jones all

1183
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,299
right we're gonna cheat

1184
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:56,520
okay you'll notice that in this case

1185
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,980
because I didn't give it enough data to

1186
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,540
because I only gave it two it's not too

1187
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,060
smart but it did pick out Janice Jones

1188
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,619
and it's just like okay

1189
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:06,660
let's keep that now you'll notice the

1190
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,800
slots

1191
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,960

1192
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,940
user doesn't know I'm storing that I can

1193
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,680

1194
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,980

1195

the username

1196
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:20,640
so it has one more question for me one

1197
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,920
more question

1198
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,060

1201
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:29,520
[Music]

1202
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,980

1203
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,480
all right

1204
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,520
so it's completed all those

1205
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,560
and it's going to utter my response

1206
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,300
which says thanks for the info Bill

1207
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,520
Jenkins so let me get this right your

1208
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,960
mother's maiden name is Janice Jones

1209
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,339
your favorite restaurants McDonald's

1210
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,619
that information should come in handy

1211
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:48,180
have a nice day

1212
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,119
okay so point being

1213
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,980
the more you give it to train on the

1214
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,900
better it gets

1215
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,700
and it allows you to store that

1216
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,440
information and use that information in

1217
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,440
any way you can fathom and again you'll

1218
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,420
have to decide if that's an appropriate

1219
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,760
direction for you and your company from

1220
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,640
a security perspective or not all right

1221
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,099
