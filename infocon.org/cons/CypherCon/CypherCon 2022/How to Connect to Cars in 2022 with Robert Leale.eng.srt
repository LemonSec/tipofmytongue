[Music]

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,920
okay

4
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,839
oh

5
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,479
all right it is 8 30 so i will commence

6
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,880
and uh we'll talk about connecting to a

7
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,119
car in 2022.

8
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,439
um i guess the genesis for this talk was

9
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,840
just you know we do a lot we connect to

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,520
a lot of cars i'd say we bring about two

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,240
or three cars a week into my office

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,000
and we're connecting all different types

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,799
of them and older cars were super simple

14
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,040
to connect to but the newer cars have

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,960
gotten a lot more difficult uh raise

16
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,320
your hand if you've ever tried to like

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,280
connect to a car before ever that guy

18
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,119
that guy so a couple people have are

19
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,840
like veterans and connected to a car so

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,040
i'm going to talk a little bit about

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,680
what it was like and what it's like now

22
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,159
raise your hand if you have a newer car

23
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,240
like you know like 20 in the past few

24
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,119
years

25
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,079
okay

26
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,680
so if you're if you're planning on

27
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,200
hacking your car that's the real

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,040
question raise your hand if you plan not

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,200
to hack your car

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,799
so everybody's gonna hack their car okay

31
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,079
good that's what i wanted to see yeah

32
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,439
okay that's that's the important thing

33
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,200
like good as

34
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,520
like that uh i'll do a real quick intro

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,680
just so you guys know who who the car

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,799
 i am uh my real name

37
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,399
is robert lee alley

38
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,959
um i you know i go again go by car

39
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,440
 i didn't put my hand over that

40
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,319
um

41
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,440
i had cars since really since i i got my

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,480
first car in 96 so that ages me um a

43
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,840
little bit um i started my company can

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,040
bus hack in 2010 we specialize in

45
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,480
hacking cars i mean that's really what

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,360
we do it's based on the trade area

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,160
and so you'll see a lot of a lot of the

48
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,239
initial research on the internet was all

49
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,560
stuff that we did

50
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,720
and a lot of the stuff that people are

51
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,480
doing now is really based on that i did

52
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,680
i started the car hacking village in

53
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,120
2015 at def con

54
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,280
and we have done even smaller versions

55
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,760
of it as well so it's been a lot of fun

56
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,440
um yeah right here i'm gonna go right

57
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,680
into the obd2 connector the good old

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,319
days the obd2 connector

59
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,480
um for those of you aren't familiar it's

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,159
uh it's this connector it's kind of a

61
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,560
trapezoidal connector that is really in

62
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,680
the kick panel of every car 1996 and

63
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,599
newer vehicles are required by law to

64
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,560
have it

65
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,239
so you have an obd2 connector if you

66
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,640
have a car that's from 96 model year 96

67
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,640
or newer

68
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,760
so you'll see them there easy to find

69
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,280
in the in the beginning they had all the

70
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,000
networks every single network that was

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,920
on the vehicle which is usually a single

72
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,120
can bus or a something called j1850 used

73
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,040
to be on there or k line there's a bunch

74
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,319
of different networks they were all

75
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,280
there

76
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,760
it was like plug and hack right you just

77
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,159
plug in and start hacking super simple

78
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,360
that was an easy easy easy situation

79
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,040
there's nothing in our way right we

80
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,440
could just plug in and start retrieving

81
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,280
data immediately it was it was a

82
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,760
beautiful day right we could send any

83
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,519
data we wanted we could if we wanted to

84
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,599
like emulate a particular controller a

85
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,760
lot of a lot of the stuff that i do and

86
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,120
continue to do um on cars is really

87
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,640
we get a lot of requests from companies

88
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,360
who are trying to build um gps systems

89
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,760
tele telematics systems and they want to

90
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,840
they want to send the unlock commands

91
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,280
right we just want to unlock and lock

92
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,560
the door

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,680
because they'll they'll make their own

94
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,680
hardware module and they'll give the

95
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,040
user a key fob and they just want to

96
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,358
lock and lock the door right so super

97
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,639
simple you can

98
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,358
you can take your existing key fob

99
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,520
copy the data that was sent from like

100
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,800
that happened to be sent when the key

101
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,720
fob was pressed and just replay it you

102
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,400
can send anything and and then you can

103
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,680
do it right from the obd2 connector

104
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,960
really nice

105
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
beautiful simple way to do it you could

106
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,639
receive all of the data that means as

107
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,720
soon as you plugged in you're just

108
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,080
bombarded with lots of data

109
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,600
really cars from 2019 and older

110
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,520
still have this feature if it's not a

111
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,199
german vehicle unfortunately during

112
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,360
vehicles they they have had gateways for

113
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,720
a very long time

114
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,800
so it's really super easy to send and

115
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,040
receive data from that obd2 connector i

116
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,520
would say more than half of the vehicles

117
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,960
on the road today

118
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,320
or made

119
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,400
that are on the road today are um are

120
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,039
able to do that still so it's still very

121
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,039
possible so the good old days we had our

122
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,080
freedom

123
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,720
uh the freedom to attack the system so

124
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,160
that's been really nice

125
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,639
um initially research was really simple

126
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,800
you could plug into the vehicle get some

127
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,180
data from it it was super fun um

128
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,320
[Music]

129
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,880
pivoting you know at that time it was

130
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
hard but

131
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
data was easy to find so pivoting

132
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,039
meaning

133
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,600
like i can get on the obd2 connector uh

134
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,160
so if i'm inside the vehicle super easy

135
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,919
but if i'm outside of the vehicle there

136
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,160
weren't a lot of attack surfaces um that

137
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,400
was back before really telemetry really

138
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,160
had any connection to the vehicle's

139
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,360
networks

140
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,280
um and stuff like that so it was really

141
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,039
really challenging um so they didn't

142
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,560
really care if you had access to

143
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
everything because really one you had to

144
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,000
be inside the vehicle to do anything

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,039
anyways that was pretty common so but

146
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,360
the problem was you know hackers hackers

147
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,080
came along and they hacked all the cars

148
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,199
i mean i'm definitely partially to blame

149
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,919
one of the first times i met

150
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,720
a gentleman from general motors

151
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
like the head at the time they didn't

152
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,560
have a cyber security division uh for

153
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,080
their automotive side they had obviously

154
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,360
the network side but they didn't have it

155
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,639
on a motorcycle

156
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,160
i i met him this was probably 2013 and

157
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,479
he he and i had a conversation and he

158
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,560
saw my blog at the time i had canvas

159
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,960
hack was just a blog on how to

160
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,400
hack your own car

161
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,479
he saw he goes robert what you're doing

162
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,000
is very dangerous and i go don't you

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,720
call me robert

164
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,840
um but yeah so it's very dangerous i

165
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,840
know why i don't understand what what is

166
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
what we're doing dangerous you know you

167
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,319
provide a port that anybody can connect

168
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,560
to and send data on what's the problem

169
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,120
he goes well here's the thing that we do

170
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,720
and something i learned is like gave

171
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,960
away some really interesting information

172
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,840
we like if i send out a message that

173
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,000
like with like if you don't know about

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,160
can bus it has an arbitration id and

175
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
data bytes the arbitration id is the

176
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,039
identifier for the message

177
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,919
if you sent a particular arbitration id

178
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,759
the car would think that

179
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,560
a module which isn't normally there is

180
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,319
there all of a sudden because i sent

181
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,960
this idea maybe i said id111

182
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
and normally one one one isn't on the

183
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,560
bus but i sent one one now all of a

184
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
sudden the car thinks there's a

185
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,800
uh a hatch you know it's like it's not a

186
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,560
car anymore it thinks it's an suv

187
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,400
because this id is on the bus

188
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,240
and i was like oh that's dumb you guys

189
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,479
shouldn't do that

190
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,400
it really was that was more sort of like

191
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,160
you know here's this guy from you know

192
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,120
really a multi-billion dollar company

193
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,880
saying we do something stupid and i was

194
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,599
like yeah i know don't do that

195
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,520
and then like he

196
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,280
was immediately just frustrated with

197
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,879
that whole concept i was like but this

198
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,759
is how

199
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,000
it works this is a computer we're going

200
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,120
to hack it

201
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,479
i don't know what the rule is on that

202
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,759
what's the internet rule is this

203
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,680
computer we're going to hack it but um

204
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,720
that's what we we do and um so we we

205
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,199
decided like eventually he decided that

206
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,599
i was right and now he has 173 people

207
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,039
that work for him in their cyber

208
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,879
security group right so

209
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,520
so they they changed their mind

210
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,960
you know and i probably gave him like

211
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,400
three promotions and he probably has a

212
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,000
nice new house because you know i

213
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,319
decided that his idea was stupid

214
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,840
um and then they obd2 connector kind of

215
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,520
in their latest version

216
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,000
gm's latest version of vehicles that ob2

217
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,240
connector does not have the can bus on

218
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,919
it anymore right they got rid of it it

219
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,199
took them

220
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,840
12 years you know to get rid of it but

221
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,640
they eventually did right so you can see

222
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,719
that that's the direction hackers are

223
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,399
definitely

224
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,799
making helping the companies make really

225
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,839
big decisions um internally and costing

226
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,600
you know essentially

227
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,680
billions of dollars to the companies

228
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,040
right um

229
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,800
i'll give you another example i was on a

230
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,160
call with uh with all very large uh

231
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,560
another different oem and they were

232
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,399
talking about they wanted to change

233
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,399
their obd2 connector they wanted to move

234
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,760
some pins around

235
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
uh well we were recommending it and they

236
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,399
said uh they were like well if we do

237
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,480
that that means we have to

238
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,720
change the tooling

239
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,279
on our diagnostic connector tool the

240
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,959
scan tool that we use if we want to

241
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,480
change the tooling on that that's going

242
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,760
to be

243
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,680
that'll be you know a few million

244
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,480
dollars probably in development and cost

245
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,240
and then we gotta tell all of our

246
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,760
dealerships that they have to buy a new

247
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,880
one uh so that'll be another four

248
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,279
three to four billion dollars so we're

249
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,640
probably not gonna do that i'm like yeah

250
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,080
i guess that makes sense that's not so

251
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,880
easy so making these changes is a very

252
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,399
very big deal they tend not to do it

253
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,640
because it costs so much money

254
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,399
to a lot of people so that's the reason

255
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,080
why i took them so long but now that

256
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,680
it's there i think it's going to be it's

257
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,040
going to be there to say so

258
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,959
manufacturers said hey stop stop

259
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,800
connecting to that connector

260
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,040
they added new security features and

261
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
i'll talk about those in a second

262
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,640
and they added new technologies to

263
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,120
prevent um us hackers from connecting

264
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,760
directly at the ob2 connector so

265
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,920
again this is a cat mouse game as

266
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,320
everybody knows in this field me as

267
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,360
acker

268
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,440
i say okay how are we going to do that

269
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,200
so remember the automotive industry

270
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,440
industry is very slow so whatever we

271
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,880
come up with whatever i talk about today

272
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,560
anybody actually anybody here from the

273
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
automotive industry if you don't mind

274
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
okay

275
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,120
yeah i know um some other issues real

276
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,880
slow they have to be slow right they

277
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,680
just you can't they're behemoth they

278
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
cost billions of dollars to make a

279
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,760
change right one time i was talking with

280
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,120
another manufacturer and they're like

281
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,800
hey we need to

282
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,640
we are going to remove cruise control

283
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,839
from this vehicle so we can add

284
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,000
bluetooth they're trying to save so many

285
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,760
pennies they try to save pennies on

286
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
vehicles because everything costs so

287
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,680
much money when you multiply a penny

288
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,600
times a million dollars right

289
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,560
so

290
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,519
um

291
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,360
so there but they will respond right

292
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,440
they will eventually get there

293
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,279
their shareholders will require it right

294
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,640
the the

295
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,000
when um chrysler fca got hacked with the

296
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,480
g-pack if you're not familiar with it

297
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,320
pretty big news in the hacking community

298
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,720
2015.

299
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,560
when that happened their stock price

300
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,240
went down by like 10

301
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,399
right that's a significant movement

302
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,880
right especially if you're a stock

303
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
stockholder so you want to want to do

304
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,560
that and then regulation now they're

305
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,040
adding a lot of regulation to force them

306
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,320
to react

307
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,240
so what do they do how did they solve it

308
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,880
they added secure gateways that's right

309
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,680
secure you know what secure means right

310
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,519
is it secure sure yeah there's some

311
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,600
features that are secure so they added

312
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,680
these gateways to isolate the obd2

313
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,839
connector so that obd2 connector is no

314
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,680
longer just connected to the rest of the

315
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
vehicle

316
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,519
and they also took the telemetry device

317
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,800
that thing that's actually connected the

318
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,320
internet and they took the obd2

319
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,760
connector the telemetry connector and

320
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,040
they moved them to their own network

321
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
they called it the dirty side i think

322
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,560
that's the actual network terrarium the

323
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,320
dirty side and then they have the clean

324
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,959
side which is the rest of the network

325
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,880
thing then the rest of the vehicle

326
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
controllers are all on the clean side

327
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,240
and then you have the dirty side which

328
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,320
is and then what separates them is this

329
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,079
gateway

330
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,000
but the good news is it's easy to bypass

331
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,040
in fact

332
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,279
this cable that you see here is you can

333
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,680
bypass the secure gateway

334
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,519
um this is just for your own car right

335
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,600
it's your own car so you can just unplug

336
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,800
a connector

337
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
plug that connector back into this this

338
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,040
two prongs over here and then it makes

339
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,720
an ob2 connector out of it and you can

340
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,680
bypass the secure gateway quite easily

341
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,279
so you can still do all the things you

342
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,040
were able to do with the old obd2

343
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,360
connector but now you have to you have

344
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,440
to do some manual work you have to get

345
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,079
to the connector to find it maybe pull a

346
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,160
panel down and then reconnect but if you

347
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,519
want to do it on your own vehicle it's

348
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,160
not that hard so it's easy to bypass but

349
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,320
it's also hard to bypass right because

350
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,240
you can only do it for one vehicle not

351
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,920
for multiple ones and then it takes a

352
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,440
little bit of time to figure out where

353
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,680
the connector lives and maybe you don't

354
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,200
really want to do that to your wife's

355
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,000
car right so she might yell at you so

356
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,120
you know those are the kind of hard

357
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
things that you got to worry about so so

358
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,399
that's the other problem and the other

359
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,000
problem

360
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,519
that we have here is they're adding

361
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,800
non-can bus networks so one thing is um

362
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,079
this thing i don't know if you guys

363
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,079
heard of this thing called ethernet it's

364
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,000
this new technology and he likes that

365
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,800
joke

366
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,920
twice um so they added ethernet to cars

367
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,480
um i know you're surprised to hear that

368
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,160
they haven't had ethernet and cars

369
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,200
really

370
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,360
um ever so they're just starting to add

371
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,079
it which means that it's

372
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,000
it's hard to connect to ethernet right i

373
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,079
mean you have to plug in well it sounds

374
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,839
hard right well this isn't actually

375
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,519
ethernet this is automotive ethernet

376
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,920
which is impossible to actually tap i

377
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,720
know that's crazy to hear but it uses a

378
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,639
technology called three pam and five pam

379
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,680
which if you're not familiar with it uh

380
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,440
you know i'm not gonna it's a 30 minute

381
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,279
talk i don't have time to go into it but

382
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,360
it's it's it's essentially impossible to

383
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,000
just tap it and see what's happening

384
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,920
or read the data on the bus because you

385
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,680
have to be a transmitter in order to be

386
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,760
a receiver on this type of network so

387
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
that means it can only have two nodes

388
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,320
maximum on the network so

389
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,160
it's really hard it's really really

390
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,720
really hard as a an attacker to even

391
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,800
read the data let alone write data on

392
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,040
other internet well so only two nodes

393
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,959
are allowed on the network evil like an

394
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,519
evil attached third node is uh is

395
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,680
essentially you have to cut the wire

396
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,120
right now so that's the only way

397
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,639
automotive ethernet really works so it

398
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,399
becomes really challenging

399
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,399
you have to break it so you can simulate

400
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,279
or be a transmitter in order to be a

401
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,760
receiver it's really really challenging

402
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,839
and of course they can add

403
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,959
ip security encryption if they wanted to

404
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,839
so it and it's very costly so

405
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,360
automotive ethernet is becoming really

406
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,880
challenging in fact they're adding

407
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,560
switches though but the good news is

408
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
there are managed switches so we could

409
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,920
probably do port mirroring if you guys

410
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,760
are familiar with that on those switches

411
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,600
um are looks like they are supporting

412
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
some port mirroring concepts

413
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,720
and

414
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,399
for the most part there might not be any

415
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,959
security built in so that's really nice

416
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,480
so why do we want to connect to the

417
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,920
vehicles well we want to reverse

418
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,480
engineer data so we can replay it

419
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,399
we want to interact with vehicles via

420
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,920
diagnostics if you're not familiar with

421
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
diagnostics it's a way to send data to a

422
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,279
controller and get data back it's

423
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,199
essentially an api to talk to the

424
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,040
controllers if you want to do a little

425
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,320
bit more reverse engineering and

426
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,920
diagnostic stuff definitely come to the

427
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,519
caring village we could show you a

428
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,680
little bit about how that works as well

429
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,000
you can read data write data

430
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,920
control outputs you can turn the lights

431
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,720
on turn the lights off uh you know

432
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,639
unlock a controller re-flash the

433
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,040
controller using diagnostics

434
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,360
you can bypass the controller's features

435
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,839
you can read out secret keys i've done

436
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,040
all of this it's awesome you can combine

437
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,120
those attacks to do multiple like really

438
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,160
interesting attacks to bypass security

439
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,199
you can pivot through that do do control

440
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,440
do controller functions you can borrow

441
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,399
cars

442
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,839
we'll show the video later if you ever

443
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,839
need to see a video aspiring car adam's

444
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,759
got one for you we did it in one of my

445
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,519
classes so what are some of the

446
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,600
solutions to get around these

447
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,680
these kind of things um

448
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,920
we can just connect right so how do we

449
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,759
connect to a car right now like okay so

450
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,519
we have a gateway we have a secure

451
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,680
gateway we want to bypass we want to get

452
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,440
around it how do you do that

453
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,279
well you got to go behind it right you

454
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,360
can't go over it you can't go

455
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,000
you guys have kids everybody has kids

456
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,560
so you got to go around it right um we

457
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,240
gotta go around this gateway so we gotta

458
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,160
go behind it so

459
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,600
we could just find the gateway often the

460
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,360
gateway is right by the obd2 connector

461
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,519
they don't really run it very far

462
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,519
um you might have to do some lookups to

463
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,839
find out where gateways are

464
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,639
unfortunately but that's what you have

465
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,040
to do you can use wiring diagrams you

466
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
know imagine a situation where you're an

467
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,880
iphone hacker you're trying to figure

468
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,120
out how iphones wired you know the

469
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,519
microphone and the the accelerometer and

470
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,680
the bluetooth the main processor

471
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,199
wouldn't it be great if iphone just

472
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,279
released all of their schematics that'd

473
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,800
be awesome right everybody would like

474
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,240
that if you're an iphone hacker would

475
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,079
love it well the good news is we

476
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,160
actually do this in automotive we call

477
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,720
them wiring diagrams and by law they

478
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
have to give them to you because they

479
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,559
have this thing called right to repair i

480
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,559
know they should have it for iphone they

481
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,000
should have radio repair but we actually

482
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,679
have a regular repair and a pretty

483
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,439
strong one in automotive so that

484
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,240
requires them to give you their access

485
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,400
to all of their wiring diagrams and you

486
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,919
can access those through your local

487
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,919
library you can access them through

488
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,319
internet you know searches manufacturers

489
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,480
each manufacturer has a tech info

490
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,319
website that you can go and download it

491
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,559
right from their website you have to pay

492
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,120
a small fee for a couple of days access

493
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,120
it's usually between 20 and 50 dollars

494
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,720
but you can get access to any vehicle

495
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,000
that you want to

496
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,200
um

497
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,039
or you can just look underneath the pack

498
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,559
you know under you know underneath the

499
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,240
driver or passenger seat and see if you

500
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,919
can find some wires right what kind of

501
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,320
wires are you looking for well you're

502
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,919
likely to find something at a body

503
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,919
controller in the trunk there's a

504
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,039
connector

505
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,280
look behind the dash usually the dash

506
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,400
has some end caps there probably some

507
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,440
can buses or other wires there

508
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,559
so that's

509
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,960
another way to get around it um we can

510
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,559
also

511
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,280
we have some other types of ways to

512
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,919
connect or connections manufacturers

513
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,200
scan tools

514
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,640
might also be able to bypass the

515
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,840
security so for instance um the fca i

516
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840
was talking about the fca which is

517
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,200
chrysler now

518
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,400
now they've changed their name to

519
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,760
something called stellantis because

520
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,280
they've added more

521
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
car companies to the group

522
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,000
so stellantis has a

523
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,080
little micropod this little like obd2

524
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,880
dongle that connects over wi-fi to the

525
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,919
car

526
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,240
and it's capable of bypassing all of the

527
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,679
secure features

528
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,200
if you've logged in

529
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,440
and had credentials so you can use that

530
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,320
tool

531
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,440
to

532
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,360
to just sort of assist you with the

533
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,320
bypassing of the security features

534
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,400
it could send can bus maybe over the

535
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,080
gateway as well

536
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,919
here's some attack scenarios maybe we

537
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,080
can connect to the secure gateway notice

538
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,840
that you are locked out

539
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,240
but you don't have a scan tool you can

540
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,400
you know phone a friend ask a friend to

541
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,880
maybe hey could you connect your scan

542
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,799
tool on your end and then you can use

543
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,280
like things uh like

544
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,600
a raspberry pi and then have them have a

545
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,440
raspberry pi there and we've done this

546
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
before two raspberry pi's and you can

547
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,080
connect them and tunnel the uh the data

548
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,559
over candy udp uh there's a there's an

549
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,559
application called candy dp or another

550
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,760
one cannelloni uh ways of connecting can

551
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,720
buses to each other virtually over udp

552
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,960
traffic just over the internet

553
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,720
and you can reliably have a scan tool

554
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,280
that's living you know somewhere else

555
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,600
do all the bypasses for you this is a

556
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,520
this is the thing that we do often as

557
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,880
well if we want to bypass some of these

558
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,039
features

559
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,880
also your local library will have wiring

560
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,919
diagrams it looks like these are a

561
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,280
little out of order so i'm going back to

562
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,440
the wiring diagrams

563
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,600
just go to your local library

[Music]

566
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,039
you know it's very easy

567
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,280
to get access to a lot of these a lot of

568
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,720
these things from the local library you

569
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,200
just ask them for it

570
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,799
internet sites that are there there's

571
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,120
some good tech tech sites as well all

572
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,320
data or mitchell one are two good uh

573
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,640
resources if you're running taking notes

574
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,320
for um

575
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,000
for connecting or getting wiring

576
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
diagrams from these things as well the

577
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,360
manufacturers bmw mercedes gm vw

578
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,360
stolantis all of them will have some

579
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,039
sort of wiring diagram feature that you

580
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,760
can download these wiring as well

581
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,000
you can hunt and find as well so looking

582
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,080
in the driver kick is always where i

583
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,760
typically will find things what you're

584
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,000
really looking for um are the body

585
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,840
controller i already kind of have this

586
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840
one but it looks like i had some out of

587
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,930
order slides i apologize um

588
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,120
[Music]

589
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,960
finding that taking a multimeter

590
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,840
voltmeter and just looking for 2.5 volts

591
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
on a wire so just tapping some wires

592
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,320
looking for 2.5 volts ethernet negative

593
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,480
1 to 1 volt

594
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,159
but look for twisted pairs right there's

595
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,000
really only three things in the car that

596
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,760
are twisted pairs there can buses

597
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,720
automotive ethernets or speakers so if

598
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
it's not a speaker it's probably a data

599
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,520
wire so twisted pairs are your friend

600
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,880
just check the voltages on them they're

601
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,159
two and a half volts you probably got

602
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,919
yourself a can bus

603
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,840
again check the trunk and caps things

604
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,600
like that

605
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,200
um i went a little fast but i wanted to

606
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,000
leave time for questions after words as

607
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,440
well so

608
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,280
a little bit of recap again car hacking

609
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,559
is getting more challenging i know you

610
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,080
guys are just getting used to it you're

611
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,320
like what you're telling me i have this

612
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,679
thing that i haven't done is harder now

613
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,039
well it's not it's just as easy as it

614
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,200
was before for you guys so you're fine

615
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,440
right um we're trying to make it easier

616
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,280
for you so you just got to stay on top

617
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,159
of it

618
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,760
check out our simulator at the car

619
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,000
hiking village little shameless plug not

620
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,640
that shameless um you know we built this

621
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,760
simulator

622
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,679
and one of the like sort of like my

623
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,840
general philosophy for getting into the

624
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,159
car hacking is just you know just start

625
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,919
right just find

626
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,120
um you know a car maybe it's your car i

627
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,880
know everybody's like like the number

628
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,400
one thing i hear is like i don't want to

629
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
break my car you won't

630
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,720
you just won't break your car guys it

631
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,640
doesn't work like that right like just

632
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,720
sending can frames to a car even if

633
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,559
you're like fuzzing it doesn't break

634
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,480
your car or when it does break your car

635
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,919
because i said it won't but it when it

636
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,679
does because robert you said it would

637
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,200
the one percent of the time that you

638
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,640
break your car take the battery off and

639
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,159
put the battery back on you just need a

640
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,960
10 millimeter socket and you'll be fired

641
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,520
the one time that that doesn't work

642
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,039
you know tell your dealership like i

643
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,200
don't know what what happened man this

644
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,000
is really weird this is so weird i have

645
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,080
no i mean this is a head scratcher what

646
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,960
is going on here it's literally one time

647
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,559
i've been hacking cars for the better

648
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,039
part of 20 years i've had one failure i

649
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,799
knew it was gonna happen when it did i

650
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,080
was like i was pretty sure i was gonna

651
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,840
make this thing not work anymore and

652
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,280
sure enough now i've been a part of

653
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,880
definitely definitely a bunch of groups

654
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,799
of students and things like that and

655
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,720
we've definitely hit cars pretty hard

656
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,280
and one other time a student did put a

657
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,880
car into the shop and it never returned

658
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,720
but we knew that could happen right it

659
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,919
was like one of those things we're

660
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,760
really trying to break the car and we

661
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,200
succeeded in the task if you're not

662
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,960
trying to break it you won't break it

663
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,200
it's just not going to happen um you

664
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
know what you could do like you can fuzz

665
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,360
a car to your heart's content now the

666
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,120
thing that i had happened to me when i

667
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,559
was buzzing a car

668
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,640
especially getting my early example of

669
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,520
when i had a jet like gm like i had at

670
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,799
the time a buick uh lacrosse phenomenal

671
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,440
car i recommend i made it think that it

672
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,280
it was it was a hard top it was it made

673
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,440
it think that it was like a convertible

674
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,799
right it's like they had a little

675
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,559
warning a convertible controller not

676
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,799
available and then add another one

677
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,600
then that one really weird situation

678
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,440
again we have right to repair we can

679
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,360
that means we can reflash controllers

680
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,880
and i just had to reflect the controller

681
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,840
myself now that wasn't an easy task but

682
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,200
when i reflashed the controller you know

683
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,360
what i found even more information from

684
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,000
the reflash because guess what happens

685
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,279
when you reflect your controller it

686
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,960
sends it over the canvas and then i

687
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,640
could capture that traffic and now i

688
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,400
have the firmware for that controllers

689
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,559
that i was reflashing so it's even

690
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,919
that's just a good idea to do like

691
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:06,960
that's the first thing you should do

692
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,120
when you get your car is reflexive right

693
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,360
it's totally legit like the thing you

694
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,840
can do and everybody has this ability to

695
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,240
re-flash the controllers in your car my

696
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,320
favorite reflash actually was i was

697
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,159
trying to reflash

698
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,520
not because it was broken i was trying

699
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,120
to reflash my

700
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,799
onstar module

701
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,400
plugged it in so i want to re-flash

702
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,840
outside module look to the list of

703
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,000
modules no onstar module they're like

704
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,919
i'm like i can't read this is the one

705
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,279
controller i want to get the firmware

706
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,679
for i want to re-flash it i'm like

707
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,880
there's got to be a way there's got to

708
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,799
be a way no there wasn't a way and then

709
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:39,760
uh

710
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,919
six months later i tried again no wasn't

711
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,159
there a few months later i tried again

712
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,919
it was there i'm like what just happened

713
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,760
why is there a reflash for this thing

714
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
that's never been a reflex forever so i

715
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,360
immediately reflash it capture the

716
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,679
traffic and then a month later it was

717
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,679
gone i'm like i just got lucky right

718
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,000
like they just they screwed up i don't

719
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,400
know what happened they saw that robert

720
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,080
logged in and

721
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,400
they said what what did you guys just do

722
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,320
and i got a chance to see the reflash

723
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,000
and i was glad i saw it because i

724
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,520
learned something really cool about the

725
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,880
onstar module

726
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,799
is the normal way reflash has happened

727
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,559
on vehicles there's a there's actually a

728
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,320
diagnostic service called

729
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,640
transfer data that everybody uses they

730
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,320
didn't use it for that one they used

731
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,080
something totally different a totally

732
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,760
backdoor way of reflashing the

733
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,840
controller and i also learned a lot of

734
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,919
reflashes in fact every reflash has some

735
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,159
sort of security exchange that happens

736
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,880
in the beginning this one didn't have a

737
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,559
normal security exchange in fact the

738
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,200
security exchange mechanism was like a

739
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,880
red herring it's fake they made a fake

740
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,400
security exchange

741
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,159
so that people thought they were doing

742
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,600
security and they really weren't they

743
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,679
had a totally side door and i only

744
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,880
learned that through reflashing the

745
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,360
controller right so and now i know how

746
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,279
to unlock

747
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,360
onstar modules

748
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,840
everywhere and then guess what onstar

749
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,760
modules can do they can make phone calls

750
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,840
and so i learned how to reprogram the

751
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,039
phone number

752
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,520
that the onstar module calls so that i i

753
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,159
didn't have to pay so like call somebody

754
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,240
anymore i just hit the button and it

755
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,679
just called that person if i wanted to

756
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,200
redial something else i just reflashed

757
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,120
that particular parameter and you got to

758
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,279
dial somebody else and so i just like

759
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,120
every time so just call that person

760
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,960
every time so you know there's a lot of

761
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,880
like really stupid things obviously that

762
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,720
was a really stupid one that you can do

763
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,000
on your car

764
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,520
um finding secret keys finding ways to

765
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,200
start the car like right now i have a

766
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,480
tesla

767
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,960
and a great car highly recommend it

768
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,279
totally possible to like

769
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,360
make that car start from a cam message

770
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,240
and drive away from a single bit of a

771
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,000
cane message just like flip this one bit

772
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,120
set it high

773
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
drive it away

774
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,520
you know those are the kind of fun

775
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,840
things that you can do

776
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,400
all you have to do is just like read the

777
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,559
cam messages and then send some other

778
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,760
ones and you can do some really

779
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,440
interesting things you can get they get

780
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,600
more complicated as well but anyways uh

781
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,200
it's four minutes to the end so i want

782
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,360
to take some questions

783
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,559
or two yeah

784
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,600
so um so my wife's got a 20 20 car okay

785
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,679
got an lte modem in it that neither of

786
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,840
us wants okay yeah we've done any

787
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,279
research into

788
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,159
what type of telemetry is being gathered

789
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,159
by automotive manufacturers not only

790
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,000
i've done research i actually had a good

791
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,840
conversation well before they changed

792
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,679
their terms of service with somebody

793
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,520
from a manufacturer who showed renamed

794
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,120
names just because i didn't want to get

795
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,440
them in trouble but they said that they

796
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,840
were capturing essentially a lot here's

797
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
what they really do they captured drive

798
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,039
data

799
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,880
because they want to know

800
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,559
how people drive because people are

801
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,720
stupid i mean this really is true like

802
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,000
they gave me a really good example they

803
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
go we got this one woman they just

804
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,159
assumed it was i don't know why i think

805
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,320
this one they really stood

806
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,399
got this one woman she just hits the gas

807
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,559
and then takes it off like she's like a

808
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,720
digital driver she says no analog she's

809
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,960
got either it's full pressed or it's off

810
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,480
it's full press starts off i'm like oh

811
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,200
my god i drove i had a uber driver that

812
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,679
did that and i got so sick like it just

813
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,600
makes you ill like he just did like rev

814
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,679
um but yeah so there's just people drive

815
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,360
all different ways so they're usually

816
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,960
doing it and

817
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,200
to the extent that it's possible they

818
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
you know anonymize it you know like

819
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,880
everybody else and ionizes you know you

820
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,880
can clearly gather where you're driving

821
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,559
to and where you're driving from

822
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,960
so how anonymous is that but they're

823
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,880
capturing every every bit of information

824
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
that they can and it's even getting even

825
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,279
crazier the cool thing is you can opt

826
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,000
out

827
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,880
by just uh uh not subscribing to the

828
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,880
services that they offer

829
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,960
um that means you don't get the offers

830
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,880
to the services and do they actually

831
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,919
follow through

832
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,360
the short answer is yes and i'm going to

833
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,120
tell you why because i had a lawyer

834
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,240
contact me

835
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,760
saying hey can you prove that they're

836
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,679
not that they're can you tell me i want

837
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,520
to sue them right and we did we did all

838
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,360
the work so i can say

839
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,399
yes that we actually monitored the uh

840
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,320
the modem itself and how much of

841
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,480
emissions it put off and it shut off it

842
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,520
did not transmit a thing for a month

843
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,600
they had no it was not even it wasn't

844
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,880
even trying to connect unless you hit

845
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,200
the button of course it was it was in

846
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,120
this full sleep mode it wasn't even like

847
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,720
broadcasting an mz or anything like that

848
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,080
so they did a really good job that

849
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,360
particular manufacturer i'm not saying

850
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,840
that for everybody but i bet you they do

851
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,600
because it's easy to test right it's

852
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,760
super easy and heck i recommend you test

853
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,880
it because if you find out that they're

854
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,559
buying in terms of service give me a

855
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,720
call

856
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,440
the fiber the most yeah like so there's

857
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,520
a fiber network called most that existed

858
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,279
in cars i actually had one for a little

859
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,399
bit

860
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,720
most is toast it's dead network it's not

861
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,840
going to exist much longer

862
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,159
the only way to do it unfortunately is

863
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,159
obviously you have to you have to remove

864
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,080
a module to put something in there and

865
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,720
you have to get a controller or a as

866
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,320
tool and i think there's only one

867
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
company that made that and they went out

868
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,440
of business because most is toast

869
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,559
um

870
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,520
so

871
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,000
i and i don't so i don't know what tool

872
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,200
they use

873
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,559
but it's a really cool network i would

874
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,320
love to see somebody actually trying to

875
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,600
hack it because i never actually even

876
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,880
tried because it was so hard to even

877
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,399
connect to so i have zero

878
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,399
recommendations unfortunately

879
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,320
yeah that's it okay we're good thank you

880
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,320
everybody

881
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,960
