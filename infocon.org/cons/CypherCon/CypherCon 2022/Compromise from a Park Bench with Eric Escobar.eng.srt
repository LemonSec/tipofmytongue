1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,399
[Music]

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,700
thank you

3
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:29,238
[Music]

4
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,218
all right

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,460
foreign

6
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,920
er uh I work for cigarettes as a

7
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,659
penetration tester I am the Wireless

8
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,659
technical lead which sounds really fancy

9
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,720
um and it's easy so I appreciate you all

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,400
coming to the very last talk after

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,380
closing ceremonies are already all over

12
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,320
because yeah it shows how dedicated you

13
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,880
really are or the fact that your flights

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,820
just haven't taken off yet yeah exactly

15
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,140
except for watch this I'm pretty sure

16
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,240
I'm gonna only talk right now so like

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,520
win win by being the only one available

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,860
I guess

19
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,900
so uh the reason that this is called

20
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,579
compromise from park bench is because

21
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,740
it's inspired by a story of an old

22
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,479
co-worker that we had named Scott ortel

23
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,400
so Scott

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,380
uh if nobody knows who Scott is I'm

25
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,240
gonna just kind of give you some insight

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,640
Scott is like the original steampunk he

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,100
lives in an apartment and he has like a

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,320
compost pile and Bin on his apartment

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,860
balcony like he is somebody that uh

30
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,140
takes the train from Chicago to Defcon

31
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,520
right

32
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,200
um and he well you know so that's like

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,119
what three four days on a train so it's

34
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,680
got Scott Scott always likes to take

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,360
public transit

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,520
um and for this particular pen test it's

37
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,318
in Chicago and decides you know what I'm

38
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,780
not gonna drive there if yet

39
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,360
uh so he decides you know what I'm gonna

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,580
I'm gonna drive or I'm I'm gonna take

41
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,800
the bus to this client site call the

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,360
client the weekend at a time client's

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,560
like yeah sure we'll see you there you

44
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,340
know it sounds good it's wireless

45
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,140
penetration test

46
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,760
um so he takes like this two-hour bus

47
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,500
ride to get to the client site which

48
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,459
probably would have been like a 15

49
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,260
minute drive for him but hey he did it

50
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,480
he shows up the client's site and it's a

51
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,220
bank and he walks into this bank and

52
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,420
he's like hey I'm here to do the

53
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,800
wireless pen test I'm here to you know

54
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,180
try and break it and compromise to your

55
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,739
wireless network and we go sir we don't

56
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,000
know who you are

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,920
and he's like well I talked with you

58
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,920
know client name she's on vacation this

59
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,239
week

60
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,459
okay well can I just like test from the

61
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:51,420
lobby

62
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,040
no sir you're gonna have to actually

63
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,120
leave the building you don't have

64
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,040
permission to be here mind you like they

65
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,660
paid us to do this penetration test

66
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,140
right so uh so Scott's like okay like

67
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,340
I'll leave the building and I'll just

68
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,080
sit in the parking lot he doesn't have a

69
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,700
car or anything to go like charge a

70
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,620
laptop or anything right so like he's on

71
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,120
his own the next bus doesn't come for

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,680
another four hours

73
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,440
okay and so then he sits he's sitting in

74
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,060
the parking lot and the security guard

75
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,500
comes up and says sir you can't be on

76
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,879
Bank of premises

77
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,220
and so they chase him across the street

78
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,340
to a park bench and that's what inspired

79
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,379
this talk I'm just like yeah compromise

80
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,480
you can do it all of this with zero

81
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,920
physical access from just across the

82
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,200
street on a park bench uh the other like

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,879
inspiration for the talk is if anybody's

84
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,879
a tablespoon fan there's also a a uh

85
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,500
song that goes along with this so if you

86
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,060
know what it is feel free to shoot shot

87
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,099
shout it out and I have a prize for the

88
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,580
person that can figure it out

89
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,599
I'm not gonna show the pictures if you

90
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,799
want to see pictures of me and Taylor

91
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,319
Swift you can see me after uh I have

92
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,280
several

93
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,920
um

94
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,840
to go further into that context uh I met

95
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,980
Taylor Swift when I was in high school

96
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,780
she was in high school and then she blew

97
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,040
up in the game Super Famous and she does

98
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,780
not remember me so that's totally fine

99
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,280
however I have pictures to prove it

100
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,140
pictures because it happened right so

101
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,879
anyways there's no crash to go along

102
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,379
with this that was just my story about

103
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,780
Scott to preface hey you can do all of

104
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,099
this sitting from a park bench

105
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,199
um so okay so these boxes that are in

106
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,600
the picture uh during covid pre-covered

107
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,918
we didn't want to travel to all of our

108
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,600
sites so we built these boxes these

109
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,160
boxes were shipped to clients so that

110
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,900
they plug it in and it's just as if I'm

111
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,880
sitting there with a laptop

112
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,060
um and when I started everything uh so

113
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,680
imposter syndrome is a real thing and I

114
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,660
just wanna I could talk to several

115
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,040
people that have been here and like hey

116
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,120
I want to be starting penetration

117
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,500
testing or hey I want to get started in

118
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,660
security but man you know I work in the

119
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,220
restaurant industry right now or hey I

120
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,419
work in this industry right now like how

121
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,040
do I get started and it's one of those

122
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,300
things that kind of the beautiful thing

123
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,680
we're in the wild west

124
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,759
um you don't need a computer science

125
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,800
degree you don't need a degree

126
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,960
um with a couple surfs and just you know

127
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,759
knowing knowing the right things to say

128
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,520
and you know what certain words mean and

129
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,780
knowing how technology works and just

130
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,400
having a curious mind you can figure out

131
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,320
a lot with just Google

132
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,639
um and so just kind of put that in

133
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,919
perspective I started as a civil

134
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,840
engineer and made my way to the security

135
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,520
career path and

136
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,139
um they don't at all there's no Venn

137
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,460
diagrams if it were a Venn diagram it

138
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,540
would be a bicycle right there's no

139
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,639
interest in there so

140
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,500
um yeah if you're if you're feeling like

141
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,880
hey I want to get involved in security

142
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,860
by all means um it's never too late

143
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,660
all right so today we're basically just

144
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,620
talking about different types of

145
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,880
penetration testing but really we're

146
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,979
going to focus on on wireless the whole

147
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,720
point of wireless penetration testing is

148
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,820
to breach the wireless network to then

149
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,500
get into the juicy stuff that is your

150
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,060
internal Network

151
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,400
um this uh this picture is basically our

152
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,840
little mobile rig that we have which is

153
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,120
just a Raspberry Pi hooked up to a fat

154
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,639
battery uh 3D printed by Matt warm over

155
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,020
there and it has our cute little Shelly

156
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,400
logo on there that marketing doesn't

157
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,259
like us to use

158
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,120
um also marketing is watching this video

159
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,580
I love you Natasha and Stacy thank you

160
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,758
for everything

161
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,039
so uh the best part about Wireless pen

162
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,440
testing is that it's like a decade

163
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,000
behind all other types of penetration

164
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,680
testing right

165
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,539
um with like external penetration

166
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:07,979
testing where you're coming in attacking

167
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,600
somebody from the public internet like

168
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,120
there's firewalls IDs IPS they'll block

169
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,100
things like there's logs and all that

170
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,900
great stuff right for an internal

171
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,460
penetration test like an Insider threat

172
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,320
okay well like you know there's again

173
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,600
logging ACLS like all these Protections

174
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
in place

175
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,139
um you know logging yeah just all the

176
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,120
stuff that can catch you right

177
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,860
um with wireless penetration testing you

178
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,319
really know that exists like if you were

179
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,759
to attack somebody if you were to try a

180
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,740
password spray from the wireless network

181
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,360
it's gonna look like it's coming from

182
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,979
inside the building even though I'm

183
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,419
sitting across the street on the Park

184
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:40,860
Bench right

185
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,660
um and so that's that's really the fun

186
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,280
part of this is that Wi-Fi extends past

187
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,080
the building so if you're thinking of

188
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,940
like oh a red team engagement we're

189
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,800
gonna go and Michael Brian back there

190
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,060
dancing

191
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,380
um you know if you think that hey you're

192
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,460
gonna do a red team testing you're gonna

193
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,720
need to like clone all these Badges and

194
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,060
sneak your way in interior pants through

195
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,620
Chris carlis

196
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,819
um you know it's one of those things

197
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,259
that you don't have to worry about that

198
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,240
you can just sit in a rented car or

199
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,160
across the street and just capture

200
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,620
hashes that way and then you're not on

201
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,120
any camera you're not going to be

202
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,800
fingerprinted at all

203
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,720
um and it's just like if you can just

204
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,860
solidly go through a wireless

205
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,319
penetration test you can be completely

206
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,979
undetected

207
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,259
um so I don't even know if the slide

208
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,360
says let me see it for a second

209
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,460
yeah so it's easy to say Anonymous this

210
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,319
is like what our original like like

211
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,180
handheld thing would have been just a

212
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,039
small little battery Raspberry Pi run in

213
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,479
you know Cali or whatever your flavor of

214
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,520
Debian is and a wireless adapter you can

215
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,620
stick that in a pocket and just use your

216
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,000
phone and so the next slide that I'm

217
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,919
gonna have this is just me using you

218
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,740
know air dump just off of an iPhone and

219
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,300
I mean if you look at me you look at

220
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,000
like you know uh like what I know what

221
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,460
you would think a hacker looks like if I

222
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,020
just have that sitting in my pocket and

223
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,759
I just have an iPhone well now all of a

224
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,680
sudden I look like any Joshua sitting in

225
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,880
your lobby waiting for an appointment

226
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,979
when in reality uh you know I'm

227
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,360
capturing handshakes on your networks

228
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,039
I'm capturing credentials uh and you

229
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,300
have no idea that I'm doing that because

230
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,680
it's all passive

231
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,240
um and so these are the things that like

232
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,419
I'm not like I'm not super smart like we

233
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,099
have Geniuses on our team I'm just

234
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,780
clever like I can just like plug things

235
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,220
into other things and just like

236
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,259
hopefully it works out right

237
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,120
um and so what's nice about this is that

238
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,560
you stick the little Raspberry Pi in

239
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,120
your pocket you're talking a hundred

240
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,740
dollars off Amazon and you can stay

241
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,860
Anonymous and if you for any data you

242
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,060
can exfiltrate it just through your

243
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,440
pocket right you know there's nothing

244
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,539
that's gonna that's gonna show up and if

245
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:31,860
it does show up if you are logged

246
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,599
somewhere again you're connected to

247
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,979
Wi-Fi which looks like it's coming from

248
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,080
internal to the corporation also if

249
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,339
anybody has any questions just feel free

250
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:39,779
to like shoot up your hand

251
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,099
um I don't want to be like oh wait till

252
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,179
the end and you have to ask all your

253
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,500
questions there I'm really informal

254
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,540
about all of this

255
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,519
um so we have several different types of

256
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,160
clients and I reused a lot of images but

257
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,519
we walk around uh large Amusement parts

258
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,019
from time to time trying to do wireless

259
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,060
penetration testing right and so what's

260
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,519
funny is that there's a large client of

261
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,380
ours that we walk around we have to

262
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,620
cover several hundred thousand acres

263
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,420
um all while trying to stay out of sight

264
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,040
and so if you look at this backpack you

265
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,120
probably wouldn't really think a whole

266
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,380
lot about that backpack but if you look

267
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,660
a little bit harder you can actually see

268
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,300
that there's what four five six antennas

269
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,800
on there that are just on the outside

270
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,899
right and this is what we would walk

271
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,220
around with and stay pretty

272
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,779
inconspicuous all the while we're

273
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,480
capturing traffic on you know 2.4 5.8

274
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,580
gigahertz uh you know capturing

275
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,500
credentials as we walk around and again

276
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,760
we're just looking at our phones we're

277
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,320
just normal tourists

278
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,540
um and uh and it's one of those things

279
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,459
again this is something that you can do

280
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,620
with staying out of sight staying you

281
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,399
know

282
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,120
um saying not getting detected

283
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,800
uh there's a close-up of what's actually

284
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,480
in there again it's Raspberry Pi's which

285
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,300
Matt marziel hates so uh he's looking at

286
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,160
me with disgusting everybody hates them

287
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,600
okay but they're really great and

288
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,740
they're really small and I use them for

289
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,959
a lot of things I really like them but I

290
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,700
mean really yeah thanks thank you back

291
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,260
there I mean it's really one of those

292
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,180
things that like that small Computing

293
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,160
platform like you can do so much with it

294
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,839
it's so versatile and you put them in a

295
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,680
backpack

296
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,380
um yeah but airport security doesn't

297
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,940
know what they are so just watch out for

298
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,060
that

299
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,920
all right so uh I'll talk a little bit

300
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,720
going down into the nitty grittier of

301
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,640
like what Wireless pen testing we do and

302
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,320
kind of how it works so if you think

303
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,940
about you know hey you're trying to

304
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,399
secure a wireless network most of us if

305
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,600
you have a home network it's probably

306
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,940
WPA2 psk where you just have a password

307
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,019
you should have a password with

308
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,459
everybody or you know your devices on

309
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,500
your network and you go from there

310
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,060
um that's a really hard hash to crack if

311
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,380
you're ever trying to crack you know

312
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,060
something Wireless something Wi-Fi and

313
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,300
WPA2 it goes like I think what 10 000

314
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,700
times slower than you know standard ntlm

315
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,920
hash which is really really slow if

316
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,839
you're trying to crack something

317
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,220
um but there are easier ways and again

318
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,600
I'm not super smart I don't know how

319
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,100
hashing like I don't know the exact

320
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,380
algorithm or the mechanics behind it but

321
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,120
if I can just get somebody to give me

322
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,060
that password that's infinitely easier

323
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,560
um and so somebody stands up a rogue

324
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,640
access point and if you're not familiar

325
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,440
Rogue access point is basically just a

326
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,779
wireless network that you the company or

327
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,339
you an individual don't control that's

328
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,260
trying to basically coerce your end

329
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,300
users into connecting to it right

330
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,980
um and so it's not hard they sell you

331
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,079
know kits that are prefab online hacker

332
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,160
Warehouse that you know look at

333
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,680
pineapple that do this a Raspberry Pi

334
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,300
with just a standard wireless adapter in

335
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,500
there and it can also create a rogue

336
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,180
access point and the whole end goal of

337
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,440
this is to just coerce somebody

338
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,180
connecting to you and then you know

339
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,500
everybody's used to cap their portal

340
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,420
popping up and who validates it that

341
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,220
Cafe portal you know belongs where it

342
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,360
shouldn't belong

343
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,980
um almost no one and somebody that's

344
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,420
going to submit user credentials to you

345
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,800
is not somebody that's going to look at

346
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,140
that either and who would do that right

347
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,220
it's one of those things that like well

348
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,420
who's going to buy a ticket or who's

349
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,560
going to try and sit in our lobby and

350
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,360
try and steal credentials um and if

351
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,860
you're a big enough Target you know if

352
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,899
you're in a very famous person or if

353
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:47,640
you're you know a company with anything

354
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,560
reasonable to try and hide or try and

355
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,700
secure

356
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,019
um you know there's a reasonable chance

357
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,399
that somebody's just going to try and

358
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,600
try and do this method right

359
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,680
um and so again this is uh if you're

360
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,120
going to run a tool called Wi-Fi Fisher

361
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,920
it does everything everything that I

362
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,019
said but does it super easily and it

363
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,180
just you know uh push button get bacon

364
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,279
right you stands a broke access point it

365
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,959
stands up um you know so it looks like

366
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,180
it closed the right Network it stands up

367
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,519
uh you know the captive portal for you

368
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,500
does all the DHCP all the networking and

369
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,600
everything for you and so then devices

370
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,700
will basically say hey I recognize that

371
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,899
access point I'm going to try and

372
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,579
connect to it because it's a stronger

373
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,079
signal than the one that I'm you know

374
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,579
the one I normally used to connect into

375
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,740
and so as as devices start to auto

376
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,779
connect to this access point traffic

377
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:32,220
starts going through there captive

378
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,660
portals start getting you know put in

379
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,399
front of end user devices and somebody

380
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,320
who's on a mobile phone that's trying to

381
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,940
you know it's trying to just get access

382
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,680
to the internet they're really not going

383
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,480
to think too hard about it

384
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,920
um and so then you'll have something

385
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,839
like this pop up now if you look at it

386
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,600
yeah this is like a splash page that you

387
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,920
know probably many of you used to seeing

388
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,040
on the Windows you know 10 laptop when

389
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,839
in reality this is all just on the

390
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,940
website itself this is all just you know

391
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,459
HTML JavaScript or whatever so when an

392
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,320
end user were to go type in credentials

393
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,360
into that page they're just going to

394
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,700
submit that to my web page which means

395
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,500
it's submitted in clear text which means

396
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,120
I don't have to crack anything I don't

397
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,560
have to do anything they just gave me

398
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,760
the passwords I don't have to worry

399
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,740
about like oh gosh how long is this you

400
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,360
know going to take on our cracking rig

401
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,620
right I have to worry about any of that

402
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,760
they just give it to me in clear text

403
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,540
which is really nice of them

404
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,220
and that's where Rogue access points you

405
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,540
can really go down the rabbit hole of

406
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,399
like what actually matters so

407
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,740
everybody's I should say everybody many

408
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,540
clients this is like the hardest thing

409
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,860
that they have is they have no detection

410
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,420
they have no logging they have no

411
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,560
information about their Wireless

412
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,920
airspace and so I'd say for 99 of our

413
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,120
clients if we go in there and do

414
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,740
wireless penetration test this is always

415
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,240
going to be a finding they never detect

416
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,800
that we stand up a rogue access point

417
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,380
that looks identical to theirs

418
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,120
um and so that's like the bare minimum

419
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,220
if you are you know the security person

420
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,440
at your company just kind of alerting

421
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,440
just have logging for an access point or

422
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,480
an SSID so like the name of your Wi-Fi

423
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,360
that exactly matches you know what what

424
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,220
is there because that's going to be 95

425
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,860
of the attacks that that come from you

426
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,240
know an attacker or threat actor that's

427
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,440
trying to get into your wireless network

428
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,060
right

429
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,500
um and with that like I mean there's

430
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,300
there's stuff that's like the prosumer

431
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,639
wireless gear like ubiquity that does

432
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,899
this out of the box and so I don't know

433
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,459
why you have the bigger companies that

434
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,019
run you know Wireless infrastructure

435
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:20,579
that don't just provide something easy

436
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,860
like this out of the box because think

437
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,300
of the power of just knowing that hey

438
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,459
somebody is just poking at our uh

439
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:27,720
external infrastructure somebody's

440
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,000
poking at a wireless network just that

441
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,320
little bit of visibility knowing that

442
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,339
hey there's something kind of weird

443
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,139
going on um it's going to generate a

444
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,579
couple hundred alerts just like that

445
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:38,040
I've I've accidentally cloned my own AP

446
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,600
at home and then all of a sudden my

447
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,160
ubiquity equipment sends me 300

448
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,540
notifications because they're like hey

449
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,540
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey there's

450
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,860
something here you should look at this

451
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,720
you should really look at this and it's

452
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,040
just right out of the box that it does

453
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,820
that

454
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,899
um and so that's that's like the number

455
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,339
one recommendation but then you can go

456
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,320
down this Rabbit Hole of you know maybe

457
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,680
not having an exact match of the of the

458
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,180
wireless network or maybe you're going

459
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,680
to randomize the MAC address or maybe

460
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,600
you're going to clone the same Mac

461
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,980
address like we could go down this whole

462
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,959
rabbit hole and say say you have a bank

463
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,519
with multiple branches what happens if

464
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,440
you went to another Branch clone that

465
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,360
Mac address went to the second branch

466
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,160
and then use that to broadcast the AP

467
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,139
the wireless controller would have no

468
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,480
idea that it's a rogue access point so

469
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,100
there's lots of ways that you can bypass

470
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,600
you know Wireless intrusion prevention

471
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,880
your wireless intrusion detection but I

472
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,740
think the heart of this is not oh

473
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,940
there's so many different ways that you

474
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,100
can bypass it but that people fail at

475
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,959
Step Zero and that's even looking to see

476
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,399
what's out there what's available and

477
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,180
what's doing what

478
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,680
uh um let's see what does this one say

479
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,019
sorry I can't see my slides on there

480
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:41,579
um

481
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:44,699
yeah so the next part of this is uh okay

482
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,260
so you have a wireless network say your

483
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,839
company everybody has you know a guest

484
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,639
wireless network and there's a lot of

485
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,680
implications of guest Wi-Fi that that

486
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,940
many people don't think about no there's

487
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,500
the obvious ones right hey is your guest

488
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,060
Wi-Fi segmented from your corporate

489
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,500
Wi-Fi that's like one of the number one

490
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,240
things we check for and surprisingly you

491
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,260
think like hey you know this is

492
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,519
something that everybody's gonna pass

493
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,860
but there's always exceptions the amount

494
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,540
of times that I found a printer on the

495
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,399
guest Wi-Fi because hey somebody needs

496
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,360
to print out this patient record

497
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,920
somebody needs to print out this order

498
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,779
form right from the guest wireless

499
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,300
network well guess what that printer is

500
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,860
authenticated to active directory and if

501
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,120
you can pivot through it well hey now

502
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,320
you have a set of credentials and now

503
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,639
you can talk to domain controller for

504
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,339
authentication you can use that for user

505
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:24,959
enumeration and further pivoting to the

506
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,160
network so that's the first thing is

507
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,199
just hey if somebody's on the gas

508
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:29,699
wireless network can they talk to

509
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,500
somebody uh that's on the corporate

510
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,180
Network let's first thing to look at if

511
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,680
you know this is something that that

512
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,240
again you're concerned with the next

513
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,160
thing though that that is often not

514
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,139
covered is do your are your devices

515
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,720
isolated from one another so if me and

516
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,279
wooly are on the same wireless network

517
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,920
can my device talk to his device and if

518
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,899
so what are the implications of that so

519
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,759
many people think like hey guest Wi-Fi

520
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,920
it's the wild west we don't really care

521
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,600
people use the guest we have that little

522
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,579
captive portal thing that pops up that

523
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,680
says oh you know what we're not that

524
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,360
worried about it because ah it's just

525
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,800
iPhones it's just people trying to get

526
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,199
internet access and no sweat

527
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,299
um where that falls down is what happens

528
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:10,260
the first time core Wi-Fi is down say no

529
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,240
users can connect to court Wi-Fi what

530
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,160
happens well everybody hops onto the

531
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,020
guest Wi-Fi well now all of a sudden

532
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,240
that means that all of your devices you

533
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,859
know for your corporation have now

534
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,780
migrated over to the guest Wi-Fi where

535
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,579
there's no protections where there's

536
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,740
Open Access and anybody can interact

537
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,020
with those laptops so on more than one

538
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,940
occasion what I've done is walked up

539
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,740
said oh there's a lot of devices on

540
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,299
Quark Wi-Fi and there's no devices on

541
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,820
guest Wi-Fi let me just nuke and kick

542
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,160
everybody off of corporate Wi-Fi they

543
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,200
hop over to guest Wi-Fi now I can

544
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,660
interact with laptops and and I can run

545
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,580
tools like responder all your normal net

546
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,140
pen tools that are going to give you

547
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,360
hashes and that's exactly what we did

548
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,039
and so we got a whole bunch of hashes

549
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,080
cracked a whole bunch of passwords and

550
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,539
then I instantly made the you know Quark

551
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,160
Wi-Fi it stopped de-authing it and so

552
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,140
everybody reconnected to it but it

553
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,400
didn't matter because at that point I

554
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,260
already had domain admin credential that

555
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,820
then I could use for whatever I wanted

556
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,620
to going forward right

557
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,299
um or in that in that same time you can

558
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,740
pivot into another house if there's like

559
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,260
SMD signing not enabled or I can reuse

560
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,000
that credential and then if I have a

561
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,280
beacon on that say say I couldn't figure

562
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,020
so say it say I have a I'm not going to

563
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,419
say Vegan because that's uh too deep but

564
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,220
like say say I was able to compromise a

565
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,660
laptop that while it was on the guest

566
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,640
Wi-Fi well now the second that that

567
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,160
laptop is on the guest Wi-Fi and then

568
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,200
it's compromised if all of a sudden now

569
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,059
it reconnects you know back to the

570
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,100
normal corporate Wi-Fi great I've tried

571
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,840
your course my way into that corporate

572
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,340
Network and it doesn't matter if there's

573
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,780
certificate signing doesn't matter if

574
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,400
they're using you know 30 character long

575
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,080
password if I was able to compromise

576
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,160
that device and now it's on your

577
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,620
corporate Wi-Fi now I've now I have

578
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,020
basically full C2 control over that you

579
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,280
know over that device and potentially

580
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,200
that Network and we we've used that

581
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,840
method you know a handful of times to

582
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,160
gain access to a network that was

583
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,080
otherwise fully secure where hey in

584
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,160
order to connect to this corporate

585
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,480
Network you needed certificates you

586
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,919
needed strong user credentials you

587
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,200
needed it to come from a proper device

588
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,580
um and again it's one of these things

589
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,000
that I have the easy job I only need to

590
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,400
find one way to attack a computer on

591
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,200
your network whereas if you're a

592
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,760
Defender you have to find all the ways

593
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,900
that somebody's potentially going to do

594
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,059
it and you have to also be you know

595
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,220
accountable to stakeholders that want an

596
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,140
easy you know end user experience right

597
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,880
because not everybody's a tech owner

598
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,820
like like us right

599
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,380
I thought somebody raised their hand the

600
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,220
neighbors for stretching

601
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,299
um so I'm going to talk about uh other

602
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:31,679
implications of guest Wi-Fi because

603
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,480
again it's one of those things that yeah

604
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,000
we just host guest Wi-Fi so what what's

605
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,679
a second um

606
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,080
we're gonna talk about egress IPS so we

607
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,880
have clients that uh they have a

608
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,520
perfectly separated corporate corporate

609
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,140
network from their guest Network so what

610
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,760
that means is that I can't talk to any

611
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,260
devices that are on the guest Network so

612
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,059
they're all isolated from each other I

613
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,260
can't talk to anything on the corporate

614
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,080
Network awesome super good job

615
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,000
um but what's interesting is that a lot

616
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,760
of the times uh the

617
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,799
public IP address that that Corporation

618
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,780
uses the egress IP the internet service

619
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,760
that they use is the same public IP

620
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,740
address just you know on a segmented

621
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,780
Network and so if you were you know if

622
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,340
you were on the corporate Network and

623
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,200
you were to say what's my IP address it

624
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,400
would be the same if you were on a guest

625
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,380
network instead what's my IP address as

626
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,059
far as the public internet is concerned

627
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,880
they see the same exact public IP

628
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,880
address well one of the things with

629
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,620
everything moving to the cloud is that

630
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,320
yeah everybody has earning we'd like to

631
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,820
see companies have multi-factor

632
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,140
authentication everywhere so you picture

633
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,840
Office 365 you log in username password

634
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,520
and then hey you get prompted from

635
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,160
multifact authentication but at some

636
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,500
point you know user usability comes into

637
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,880
play here and they say hey you know what

638
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,980
look we require badges we require access

639
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,600
we have cameras to get into the building

640
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,760
let's just assume that if they're in the

641
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,840
building and they're using valid

642
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,700
credentials like guess what we're just

643
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,320
going to let these users go by without

644
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,299
using multi-factor authentication if

645
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:56,039
you're in the office we don't need any

646
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,320
use for multi-factor authentication

647
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,179
um on something like Office 365

648
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:01,860
well the problem with that is the way

649
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,860
that you enable that is by saying hey uh

650
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,260
Microsoft's a sure Office 365 there's a

651
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,940
trusted IP address and that trusted IP

652
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,080
address we're not going to require

653
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,299
multi-factor Authentication but if you

654
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,340
hop on the guest Network you have the

655
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,620
same public IP address so now all of a

656
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,120
sudden you can log into somebody's

657
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,760
Office 365 with zero multi-factor

658
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,740
authentication and then you can do

659
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,539
everything that would then go from an

660
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:25,919
external penetration test from an

661
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,780
internal penetration test all of your

662
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,220
other typical ways of penetration

663
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,440
testing but you've bypassed multi-factor

664
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,299
authentication and again everybody I

665
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:34,799
mean maybe not everybody but a common

666
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,720
thing is like dude who is going to go

667
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,520
show up to your organization who's going

668
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,620
to go show up to your branch who's going

669
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,140
to go buy a plane ticket and use this to

670
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,360
you know compromise or company and it's

671
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,919
like sure you know it's definitely a

672
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,480
threat you know it may not be the first

673
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,640
thing on anybody's priority list but

674
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,320
think if you're a large chain think if

675
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,640
you're a large chain restaurant they

676
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,740
give your large chain retailer now all

677
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,299
of a sudden you know you probably if

678
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,799
there's an attacker in your city that

679
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,000
wants to do this they don't have to go

680
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,620
very far it might just be a grocery trip

681
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,840
for them where they can then use this to

682
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,179
their advantage to then compromise the

683
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:08,280
whole rest of the organization

684
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,900
um so again you know is this gloom and

685
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,640
doom absolutely not but it's just

686
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,440
something to consider when you're giving

687
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,120
Public Access and you're giving you know

688
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,820
wireless access that extends Beyond you

689
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,539
know your typical brick and mortar walls

690
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,880
has anybody have any questions with that

691
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,120
anybody find the Taylor Swift song

692
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,189
[Music]

693
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,020
you look at my egress

694
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,000
for my company

695
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,140
and

696
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,400
you can see look at the square handles

697
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,620
that are out there and see if that data

698
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,760
I mean the the problem with the problem

699
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,580
that I see in men again I know not a

700
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,320
whole lot of things but the problem that

701
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,440
I see with that is uh you like if you're

702
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,179
the system administrator you're the one

703
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:07,620
that's already allowing the IP address

704
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,240
and so you just be checking the

705
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,880
reputation of your own IP address and

706
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,200
really

707
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,240
um I mean you can see that but there's

708
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,500
not going to be a way for you to

709
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,720
potentially differentiate hey is this a

710
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,280
thread actor that's coming from inside

711
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,720
our corporate Network like maybe just

712
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,640
the the you know malicious employee

713
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,260
versus somebody on the guest Wi-Fi

714
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,480
because as far as you can see it's only

715
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,640
coming from your public IP address is

716
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,200
that answer it all right

717
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,039
um so the other thing that I meant oh

718
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,620
well done well done I'm a prize for you

719
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,780
at the end of this everybody give him a

720
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,559
round of applause

721
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,400
sitting on our park bench thank you

722
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,620
anymore on the songs uh you can keep

723
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,340
guessing all the songs

724
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,080
what was that he has to sing it now oh

725
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,159
yeah if somebody wants to sing it that's

726
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,760
another prize

727
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,140
um so okay say somebody has an Uber

728
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,460
secure network there's no way you're

729
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,020
getting in they don't have guest Wi-Fi

730
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,880
everything is certificates everything is

731
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,679
as good as it can be there's still more

732
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:12,659
fun that can be had so if you look at

733
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:13,980
the screen this is a screen from one of

734
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,360
the tools that we mainly use called

735
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,919
error dump right

736
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:18,179
um and really there's a whole just a

737
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:19,919
bunch of weird numbers and those weird

738
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,840
numbers and symbols are Mac addresses so

739
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,159
that's the hardware address of that

740
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:24,419
device is connecting the wireless

741
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,880
network now this is always in plain text

742
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,260
because this is what has to be used for

743
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,140
devices to negotiate who hey who is this

744
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,520
device on the network this is how you

745
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,380
know the base thing that that Wi-Fi uses

746
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,659
to communicate device to device

747
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:38,880
um and so I can see on the left side and

748
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,120
on the right side the the station do I

749
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,820
have that right yeah so the station on

750
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,320
the right is like a client device so you

751
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,000
can think maybe this is my Nest

752
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,400
Thermostat maybe this is my wise camera

753
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,360
right

754
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,980
um and on the left hand side that is the

755
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,240
wireless access point that it's

756
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,100
connecting to what's interesting about

757
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,360
this again all this information is

758
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,320
included text and you're probably

759
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,240
thinking error this is useless to pretty

760
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,039
much anybody because it's just random

761
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,659
numbers what information could that give

762
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:06,539
you and so if you were to see this so

763
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,700
this is just a bigger view of it

764
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,020
so if you were to take that Mac address

765
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,600
each Hardware manufacturer has a MAC

766
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,880
address that's registered to them when

767
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,440
they're manufacturing devices

768
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,820
um that way there's not you know it's

769
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,620
supposed to prevent like you know uh

770
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,840
duplicate Mac addresses from duplicate

771
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,700
um you know manufacturers right but I

772
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,679
can see hey just based upon that that

773
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,000
address right there that Mac address

774
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,860
even though I have no information about

775
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,179
the wireless network even though I can't

776
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,220
compromise the security at all I can

777
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,539
still see that they're running the nest

778
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:35,220
thermostat and what's interesting about

779
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,500
that is that say I find out that you're

780
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,539
running you know some wise devices some

781
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,600
Google Nest devices some Alexa some you

782
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,919
know all these smart home things right

783
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,299
well they have other Wireless

784
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:46,679
connectivity in there they have

785
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,080
Bluetooth they have NFC they have Aurora

786
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,340
they have all this other technology

787
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,100
that's on there and so now I know what's

788
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,320
in your house without ever having

789
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,059
compromised the wireless security just

790
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:58,260
because of what they're beaconing just

791
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,279
because of their IDs that they're

792
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,260
beginning and so there's potentially

793
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,760
some other vulnerability that gets

794
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,799
disclosed about any of those devices on

795
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,020
any other different protocol well now

796
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,179
you have another vector or another way

797
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:10,919
into this you know users Network plus

798
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,480
you have a bunch of information about

799
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,220
them right and it doesn't have to be an

800
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,720
end user or house it could also be a

801
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,520
building you could know that this

802
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,080
building is using ring security or

803
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,700
Sentry safe or maybe they're using

804
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,380
that's an alarm and you can know that

805
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,700
based upon just the hardware information

806
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,279
that's beaconed out completely nuclear

807
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,400
text

808
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,039
what does this saying

809
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,200
yeah so uh what's I figure with the

810
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,700
adage is you know something can be

811
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,200
simple but it's not easy to do right so

812
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
it's really easy for me to get up here

813
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,080
and be like yeah everybody you should do

814
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,820
this you should secure your networks

815
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,620
this way but having been on the other

816
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,620
side of it it's way way way harder to

817
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,059
put this into practice and I sympathize

818
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:49,799
with that right I sympathize that every

819
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,539
single time I run a penetration test but

820
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,039
again I only needs to find the easy way

821
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,440
in I don't have to you know block all

822
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,059
the holes or one of the other things

823
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:59,340
that frequently comes up is hey if we

824
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,020
were to patch this if we were to upgrade

825
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,200
from Windows XP to you know Windows 10

826
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,000
all of a sudden well now that's not

827
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,140
going to work with all of this Hardware

828
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,480
that we have so I'm sympathetic to all

829
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,279
of that stuff so so don't take this

830
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,600
whole presentation again like oh yeah

831
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,860
wow everybody's doing wireless security

832
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,779
terribly because there's a lot of other

833
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:17,100
things that come into play I mean we

834
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,020
test hospitals all the time the amount

835
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,820
of times that we find a wireless network

836
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,000
that's running WEP is you know

837
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,559
frequently quite frequent and that's

838
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,240
completely broken protocol that you know

839
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,799
in about seven minutes you can fully

840
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,480
compromise but you know you think hey

841
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,220
this isn't a hospital and there's

842
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,260
pumps using WEP that are connected to

843
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,360
this wireless network that's terrifying

844
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,220
and so it's easy for me to say well just

845
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,740
upgrade in WPA2 and then you realize oh

846
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,900
well the vendor went out of business and

847
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,460
so there's no more firmware you know

848
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,860
upgrades available or to upgrade to that

849
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,720
is going to mean you know a 10 million

850
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,000
dollar roll out of all these new insulin

851
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,020
pumps that they've already invested

852
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,720
money in so so it's not an easy fix for

853
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,700
anything by any means and it's simple

854
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,559
for me to be up here and just to say ah

855
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,120
do it right you know don't do it wrong

856
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,620
there's a lot of considerations that

857
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,140
have to be taken

858
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,840
um yeah so understand what information

859
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,279
you're beginning out

860
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,320
um log your data have logs available the

861
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,179
amount of times that uh we run a

862
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:13,500
penetration test and I'm like oh well we

863
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,120
saw your Rogue access point and I was

864
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,440
like okay can you just give me some line

865
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,940
information so I can include that in the

866
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,960
report

867
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,520
and then I never hear anything back and

868
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,020
then I give him the report and it's like

869
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,880
log your data you know know what

870
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,860
wireless access points are out there

871
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,020
um and again it comes stock on on many

872
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,500
common platforms so just just Google it

873
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,080
yeah anyways questions comments want to

874
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,400
hear a joke

875
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,679
uh what do you run on the Raspberry Pi

876
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,320
is Holly or Kelly you're just or just

877
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,840
raspbian yeah Cali typically has like

878
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,860
the better libraries like everything

879
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,000
like kind of works whether you use

880
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,679
active install

881
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:48,779
um but you know when you install Cali

882
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:50,100
it's like oh great you get everything in

883
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,020
the kitchen sink installed on there

884
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,980
um and if you just want to keep it

885
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,200
leaner you can run just raspbian um I

886
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,640
don't do anything like again like I'm

887
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,380
not gonna like build my own custom pen

888
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,659
two thing I'm not that smart so

889
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,820
do you use open heart at all

890
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,039
yeah I use it for like some of our

891
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,080
captive portal like little devices

892
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,179
um it's yeah I mean like I use it

893
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:11,640
sometimes not all the time though

894
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,919
