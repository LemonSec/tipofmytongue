thank you

[Music]

4
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,719
good morning

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,399
thank you

6
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,619
the Titleist talks total life of a

7
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,479
feeling we're not on the VPN anymore and

8
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,600
no my dog is not named Toto if you did

9
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,939
any bit of the osm challenge my dog is

10
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,640
named Kelso long story they're not going

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,920
to go into it but it's kind of weird

12
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,420
when you find out a lot of people are

13
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,040
like investigating your life and like

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,640
secretly like social engineering it's

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,340
weird to know so much about you it is I

16
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,040
feel closer to all of you but in a weird

17
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,360
way

18
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,820
but I appreciate it so I'm John with

19
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,920
atomic

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,320
um also known as sake bomb which is

21
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,180
probably what most people here would

22
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,079
know me by my call sign here for my ham

23
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,920
radio licenses K4 ruk in case you needed

24
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,960
that one as well I was I wasn't sure

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,460
what time I was going to do this so

26
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,899
hopefully people are gonna sit on the

27
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,659
talk for this osm thing but it all

28
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,579
worked out

29
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,700
um I am a former marine sergeant that

30
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,960
was another one of those puzzles so

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,399
you'd have that

32
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,380
um and I basically traveled to I think

33
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,020
about 50 countries around the world and

34
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,419
have done many numerous jobs from now

35
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,560
analysis research Network forensics

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,200
cyber crime tracking cyber Espionage

37
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,360
tracking you name it and now basically

38
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,160
that all is kind of Consolidated into

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,040
what we call threat intelligence which I

40
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,379
guess it's kind of that but

41
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,140
um I really enjoy it nonetheless I am

42
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,900
also a co-founder and organizer of

43
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,500
Stockholm so if

44
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,000
so after this if you guys don't have

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,739
tickets get ready for that because it's

46
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,400
just as fun

47
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,080
and that's where we have the after after

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,440
party it's really really worthwhile

49
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,660
okay enough about me on any of that you

50
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,220
guys can ask questions or get to know me

51
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,180
later

52
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,879
so let's dive deep into our fun talk

53
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,040
tonight

54
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,260
follow Gatlinburg Road

55
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,860
as we go into this talk I want everybody

56
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,440
here to realize that I'm going to be

57
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,640
focusing a lot more on the commercial

58
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,640
VPN space well commercial being the ones

59
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,959
that people are going to pay for whether

60
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,840
they're free or just available to use

61
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,459
I'm not going to really focus on the

62
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,159
protocols like openvpn or wireguard but

63
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,659
I'm happy to answer a lot of those

64
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:19,980
questions afterwards if you're

65
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,400
interested but I just want everybody in

66
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,780
here to be aware of

67
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,000
their surroundings let me put it that

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,519
way so to begin

69
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,540
we have what almost a couple thousand

70
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,879
different VPN providers that exist out

71
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,800
there from

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,319
Nord Express Etc you can find some

73
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,480
actually let's let's even click on it

74
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,940
how many do we think we have

75
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,340
to see if this loads

76
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,239
Lots can you guys see this great

77
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,280
so

78
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,540
I've analyzed approximately

79
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,700
650 different ones so we have quite a

80
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,959
few for you to choose from if you ever

81
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,360
want to know and they're quite easy to

82
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,739
reverse engineer if you want to learn

83
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,180
I'm happy to teach you that after a

84
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,480
while after this as well but anyway back

85
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,760
to the

86
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,200
oh

87
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,879
so

88
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,339
650 vpns I've looked at including

89
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,220
different proxies Etc and a lot of them

90
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,500
love to offer this these no logging

91
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,960
policies for you yay privacy right

92
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,100
because that's what we're really here

93
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,960
for is we want to feel secure that's why

94
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,419
we have a VPN or at least most people or

95
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,600
bypass censorship or speed boost or

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,040
protect me while I'm playing a video

97
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,500
game so I don't get ddosed or just watch

98
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,020
some streaming service like Netflix from

99
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,000
anywhere

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,180
and as we've been paying attention to a

101
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,979
lot of the uh if you watch YouTube you

102
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,300
get a lot of really great ads for

103
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,240
expressvpn here on nordvpn there and

104
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,000
they are really packing it in in all the

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,160
different uh providers and content

106
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,720
creators are definitely pushing that

107
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,280
whether you watch Twitch or wherever

108
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,440
because they're making a lot of money

109
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,600
off of us because basically everybody

110
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,419
wants a VPN because they feel safe

111
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,240
there are some new kinds of vpns in town

112
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,419
though just other outside the ones that

113
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,759
um you've heard of and some of those are

114
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,220
peer-to-peer based they're called D vpns

115
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,940
and they are cryptocurrency

116
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,620
um

117
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,259
they are offering a new form of privacy

118
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,780
that I guess is effectively the same as

119
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,580
all the other ones but at least they get

120
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,139
to say it

121
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,699
um and then there's also Shadow socks

122
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,560
which is another form of protocol that's

123
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,479
really really getting popular because

124
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,160
it's able to get around certain things

125
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,320
in China

126
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,919
um

127
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,860
so is the Emerald City really made of

128
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,340
emeralds

129
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,360
I don't know

130
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,940
why would anybody go online and just lie

131
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,680
I mean why would these providers do any

132
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,479
of these sorts of things

133
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,400
I was really hoping for that but I'm

134
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,940
very pleased

135
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,080
so

136
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,360
with that oh my gosh lions and tigers

137
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,979
and bears oh my

138
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,320
God so we obviously put a lot of trust

139
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,120
in them mainly because we do pay for

140
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,539
these services and we seem can buy the

141
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,979
things that we know whether or not it's

142
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,020
advertised or not but we hear about it

143
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,759
organically from our friends or other

144
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,900
Affiliates like greats review sites and

145
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,720
other trusted sources

146
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,060
and we see that there's obviously a lot

147
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,639
of competition we have you already saw

148
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,400
there's thousands of different types of

149
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,500
providers and they all offer or try to

150
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,060
offer something unique about them

151
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,460
whether it's a speed boost or the uh

152
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,580
let's see we have additional programs

153
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,600
that'll help you out with password

154
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,639
protect because obviously that's what I

155
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,940
want my VPN to do for me as well

156
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,240
um but in addition to this there are

157
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,860
lots of vpns now that are getting

158
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,220
heavily targeted by Hollywood because

159
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,500
they have servers whether they're here

160
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,720
in the US and Europe wherever it is and

161
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,759
they're getting really heavily sued and

162
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,199
I did include a bunch of links in here

163
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,240
if you're interested in the slides so

164
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,620
you can click on them and read all about

165
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,960
this stuff

166
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,940
and basically how it's all working is

167
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,500
instead of targeting the individual

168
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,560
users that are doing torrenting now the

169
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,319
actual VPN providers are now going after

170
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,060
the people even though they say they're

171
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,460
not logging they still will go after you

172
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,560
so how can you have both a logging and a

173
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,240
non-blogging solution at the same time

174
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,060
it doesn't really work that way

175
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,199
so

176
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,060
with that being said as well this is all

177
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,520
jurisdictional so every country has its

178
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,500
own rules just because Nord might be

179
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,020
based out of Panama doesn't mean they

180
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,819
can't don't have to abide by rules of

181
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:48,240
the USA because they have servers in the

182
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,560
US they have vpns that might exist in a

183
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,020
data center such as like AWS they might

184
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,759
have a different Data Center

185
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,800
or they might have a residential Network

186
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,360
which is kind of how they're now

187
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,099
starting to bypass a lot of these

188
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,199
security protocol or security measures

189
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,199
that is why certain student providers

190
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,819
cannot block them

191
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,580
but that's slowly coming to an end which

192
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,860
if anybody in here uses a VPN they're

193
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,479
starting to notice why isn't my VPN

194
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,880
working when I try to stream Netflix

195
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,919
this is why there's a huge Crackdown

196
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,539
coming and a lot of it's because of

197
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,580
these lawsuits saying this is how we're

198
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,220
going to go after that problem

199
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:26,940
um

200
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,819
countries are also doing this so India

201
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,620
is the new one on there which says if

202
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,299
you have a VPN doesn't matter if it's in

203
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,799
a data center we need to know about it

204
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,479
here's the IP address and tell us

205
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,799
everything about it so that's going to

206
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,839
be a big jumble so just be mindful of

207
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,940
some of that

208
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,459
in fact uh even vpns are suing each

209
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:45,660
other there's

210
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,640
several that I can account for tour

211
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,580
guard sues nor VPN for blackmailing them

212
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,740
you have it's actually really

213
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,420
interesting based upon where they're

214
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,580
located so we have one that's kind of

215
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,320
not going to call it really a VPN or a

216
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,940
pro but it's more of a proxy for

217
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,940
residential proxies but you have

218
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,980
um bright networks formerly Illuminati

219
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,220
and oxy labs are in a lawsuit but one of

220
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,959
them is based out of Lithuanian one's

221
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,880
based out of Israel so why would they

222
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,980
sue themselves in Texas

223
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,980
great question because the U.S laws are

224
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,720
very fantastic and you know what's great

225
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,940
the vpns are using them for residential

226
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,620
proxies so be mindful of everything

227
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,420
you're doing there because

228
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,060
this is it all comes down to the nice

229
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,839
lovely dnca and law but anyway

230
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,480
rambling on again okay

231
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,000
so they also like to give you a lot of

232
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,279
really good applications to use whether

233
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,380
it's for on your mobile device on your

234
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,540
desktop it could be a browser extension

235
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,920
it doesn't really matter but that's what

236
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,080
they're giving us in fact even one of

237
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,720
them now has Quantum resistant VPN Keys

238
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,899
oh my that just came out yesterday

239
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,519
imagine I love this

240
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,500
so now let's get into where it all gets

241
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,360
really juicy

242
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,760
so after investigating and looking into

243
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,260
a bunch of these proxies and don't worry

244
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,140
I'll show you some great examples

245
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,820
a bunch of them

246
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,480
mainly the free ones are really just

247
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,820
proxies in fact they're not even doing

248
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,100
any encryption maybe they're doing a

249
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,720
very little form of encryption which

250
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,700
I'll show you

251
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,540
um they actually don't block webrtc and

252
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,060
what that means in case uh you've never

253
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,279
heard of this basically it's a way that

254
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,440
you can actually find out the IP address

255
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,959
of the person that's going across the

256
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,540
VPN so if I'm visiting a wet bus site

257
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,820
that has web RTC enabled I can actually

258
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,700
figure out who is behind the proxy or

259
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,839
the VPN

260
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,019
Silva what's the point of a VPN

261
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,540
they just don't block it in fact some of

262
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,279
them don't even have a kill switch which

263
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,980
is if I'm surfing the internet and I

264
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,320
have my VPN enabled and it somehow dies

265
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,300
with this a hiccup I still want to be

266
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,980
able to browse but the kill switch is

267
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,240
going to stop you from having that

268
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,680
option

269
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,440
but now you're not private again and in

270
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,440
fact there was uh that's if you're

271
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,240
familiar there was what was that company

272
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,060
uh ubiquity was ransomed for like four

273
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,660
billion dollars a couple months ago and

274
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,899
the person behind it was using surf

275
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,519
shark and surfshark did not have a kill

276
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,920
switch and they figured out this was the

277
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,019
guy behind it because the kill switch

278
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,899
failed and they had his home IP address

279
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:30,600
so again that'll love how vpns operate

280
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,019
so things to consider

281
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,899
and very very recently within the past

282
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,959
week surf shark turbo VPN Viper and

283
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:40,980
Atlas

284
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,079
pay attention to some of these names by

285
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,220
the way you're going to see how they all

286
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,160
kind of collaborate

287
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,620
they were caught installing a root CA

288
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,540
certificate so what that allows you to

289
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,519
do if you've ever used a man in the

290
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,940
middle proxy I can create a SSL

291
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,700
certificate that allows me to decrypt

292
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,220
traffic anytime I so choose

293
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,260
they all did it or I can manipulate

294
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,839
traffic however I want to do it why

295
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,160
would they do that

296
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,160
I thought they were for us I love these

297
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,740
kids okay sorry

298
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,560
um some of them also do what's called uh

299
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,959
HTML or browser canvassing which is

300
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,720
where they can see and watch as not only

301
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,640
as you type but as you move your mouse

302
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,940
around and see all the movements which

303
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,279
is kind of a weird little thing right

304
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,260
while they like to take some of that and

305
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,600
clone those actions and sell it for and

306
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,210
for other

307
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,360
[Music]

308
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,700
um in fact even the private relays like

309
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,180
apple private relay somebody uh moment

310
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,940
in an analysis and they basically

311
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,579
because of how Apple's using their

312
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:48,779
protocols they're using this thing

313
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,459
called quick it's

314
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,980
different than TCP or UB it's a very

315
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,620
special protocol but it basically allows

316
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,500
it allows Apple private relay to bypass

317
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,839
firewall rules so if you had certain

318
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,060
things in place you get to go around

319
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,620
that

320
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,180
and

321
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,220
I think probably the worst part is

322
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,740
instead of spending all the money on

323
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,019
security they spend it all on the ads

324
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,300
they're now they get compromised pretty

325
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,399
frequently and there's been several

326
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,500
instances where all of the keys on the

327
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,959
systems were stolen so they could have

328
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,120
and this happened for I think about a

329
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,920
good month or two watching all the

330
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,779
traffic if you were

331
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,680
just a regular normal hacker not like

332
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,019
an Espionage level of nation state which

333
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,940
imagine that why would they want that

334
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,560
data

335
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,160
been watching traffic so

336
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,220
that's basically that's the start of

337
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,060
this

338
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,779
so let's dive in for a couple little

339
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,060
vpns so you can see exactly what some of

340
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,260
these guys are doing for encryption

341
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,279
levels

342
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,019
if you're not familiar with base six

343
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:59,399
people or URL including well let's throw

344
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,860
in a little bit of rock 13 in there and

345
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,620
call that some encryption and

346
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,380
do some very basic things right

347
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,560
in fact we'll just give full requests

348
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,200
and have some delicious permissions

349
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,180
that give us full access to how your

350
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,700
browser works not encode it and just do

351
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,700
the bare minimum and

352
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,980
yes this one's a free this is free and

353
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,440
paid as a VPN but I just wanted to show

354
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,560
you and this one I did a bit of this

355
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,980
analysis with CRX I think it's called

356
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,200
I remember it but duo we built this

357
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,480
wonderful tool for you to basically rip

358
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,360
apart all CRX encoding extensions in

359
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,899
Chrome and it makes it really clean so

360
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:43,860
that's why I'm going to use a couple

361
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,620
examples there but they also gave you

362
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,600
these lovely permissions and rate them

363
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,899
for you

364
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,339
so like me a lot of people use this one

365
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,920
surprisingly

366
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,240
they're right there

367
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,220
I think I don't know why when I looked

368
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,839
at it but I just thought that stood out

369
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,040
a little bit

370
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,339
secret internals do not uh use let's

371
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,079
fire some people but you'd think that

372
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,180
they would try to do a little bit more

373
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,500
with our

374
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,480
actual privacy here

375
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,480
or adding this in here remember I was

376
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,959
talking about how they are doing the

377
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,519
HTML canvassing that they're actually

378
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,160
tracking and monitoring your mouse

379
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,800
movements and your keyboards

380
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,100
because all that data if you're not if

381
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,199
it's free you're the product as we've

382
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,199
heard before however now in this lovely

383
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,820
day and age even if you're paying for

384
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,560
stuff you are also again the product

385
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,560
imagine that but

386
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,579
if uh for my past life of doing ad fraud

387
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,380
work which is pretty boring by the way

388
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,760
but it's also kind of fun because it's

389
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,260
kind of like one of those soft crimes

390
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,300
that nobody really goes after the people

391
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,079
that do at fraud well if you can steal

392
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,839
an actual humans movements with a mice

393
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,880
you can do a lot of really cool things

394
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,820
to bypass ad fraud tricking and the

395
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,199
catches and stuff so that's kind of how

396
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:05,579
they steal some of this which is why

397
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,800
they have this

398
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,320
or it would be a shame if they showed

399
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,500
you all of their servers and maybe these

400
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,240
names and passwords

401
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,940
and just put it all right here for you

402
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,639
and so you could just see who's using

403
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,220
your networks and anybody can log in and

404
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,740
play around because it's baked into

405
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,940
their code

406
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,640
[Music]

407
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,639
high schoolers gotta make money somehow

408
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,199
somebody's got to make money these

409
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,899
aren't high schoolers I wish they were I

410
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,839
wish they were these are liquid I don't

411
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,199
want to call them legitimate voters but

412
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,579
that's actually a fun thing to look at

413
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,639
as as I'll go into when I get into some

414
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,980
of the Android stuff but

415
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,680
when you submit an app you have to

416
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,540
submit enough information about who

417
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,100
created it and a lot of these times

418
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,779
you're going to find like Joe schmoe

419
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,579
gmail.com and you're like that looks

420
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:05,180
pretty legit

421
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,459
Okay so

422
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,980
this one's fun zenmate this is actually

423
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,119
a pain

424
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,699
VPN that a lot of people use and said in

425
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,140
fact tied to a different one and I'll

426
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,240
get to that in a moment but

427
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,640
I don't know if you can look right here

428
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,380
blockchain imagine

429
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,099
um

430
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,500
I don't know if this matters anybody

431
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,140
here but if your phone is doing

432
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,299
cryptocurrency uh

433
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,480
mining you probably want to know about

434
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,580
that especially at a low rate why is

435
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,600
your phone

436
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,080
like mining at any given time well the

437
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,580
fun part is even though that's this

438
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,039
part's the probe extension it's doing it

439
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,140
on iOS as well and you can see look at

440
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,559
how detailed they're lovely

441
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,980
updates are every time they do a patch

442
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,559
it looks just a little bit the same

443
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,160
yeah

444
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,020
so there's a fun thing about IOS and

445
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,000
Android that is if you don't update your

446
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,980
app every six months they'll kick it out

447
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,120
the store

448
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,940
so imagine

449
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,280
maybe this is why they do that well a

450
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,580
fun thing here two is some of these apps

451
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,620
actually whether it's on Android or iOS

452
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,440
by the way they will have special things

453
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,179
that they'll download which will then

454
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,220
execute so that's how they bypass a lot

455
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,200
of restrictions in the stores just so

456
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,140
you know or the apps actually won't even

457
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,240
activate until your device is sitting

458
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,400
for long enough about five minutes or so

459
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,299
maybe a little longer and once that is

460
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,280
settled because obviously our phones are

461
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,679
basically like accelerometers all the

462
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,179
fun things it knows it's not moving

463
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,980
there's not a lot of bandwidth that's

464
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,320
when your device actually turns on and

465
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,880
allows them to reverse tunnel and use

466
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,720
your IP address for a IP a residential

467
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,179
IP of that

468
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,700
so let's look at some of the permissions

469
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,620
so I'm just going to go through two

470
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,179
really kind of crud ones and then I'll

471
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,860
give you some good examples of better

472
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,320
ones but why would a GPS need to know

473
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,480
your precise location

474
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,760
I don't know I don't know why that would

475
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,559
matter or why does it need to run at

476
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,000
startup or prevent your device from

477
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,860
sleeping or reading your service

478
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,140
configuration files why does it even

479
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,299
need to know about your phone why does

480
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,799
it have to activate the microphone in

481
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,000
cases

482
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,039
I don't know

483
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,780
for eating your device I forgot to

484
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,580
highlight that one all right well you

485
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,020
probably haven't heard of those but you

486
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,280
have heard of these

487
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,740
Norton expressvpn probably the two most

488
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,320
popular vpns out there right now why do

489
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,460
they need to know about some of your

490
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,919
Wi-Fi connections oh maybe it's because

491
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,260
they want to know which IP address you

492
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,480
are coming from or who's around you what

493
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,880
other networks are out there

494
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,620
why do they need to interact with other

495
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,720
users on your phone why do they also

496
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,980
need to run a startup and be able to

497
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,080
create shortcuts things that people

498
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,000
aren't really paying attention to with a

499
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,059
lot of your actual apps because

500
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,679
everybody has your phone on you at all

501
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,240
times and how often does your phone ever

502
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,580
shut off like your laptop oh wait nobody

503
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,299
really does that ever

504
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:14,460
expressvpn2 precise location or why does

505
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,179
it need to pair with Bluetooth devices

506
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:22,200
so fun thing here is just like it's also

507
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,900
doing the Wi-Fi collect connections as

508
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,580
well as the Bluetooth devices it finds

509
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,260
out who's also near you

510
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,660
the way that this data is collected is

511
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,480
as your phone is on it's seeing what's

512
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,220
around you at that given point and with

513
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,460
the precise location as you walk around

514
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,400
it's saying here I am right now here's

515
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,440
this Wi-Fi access point as it keeps

516
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,000
seeing it in in collecting it and

517
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,480
sending it back it's triangulating where

518
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,340
those access points are they're doing

519
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,320
data collection for you or you're doing

520
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,840
it for them rather but you pay for it

521
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,080
boys yeah that's fantastic or just do it

522
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,539
for wiggle for free I mean that's why we

523
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,220
have wiggle right if anybody here

524
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,440
doesn't know what wiggle net is check it

525
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,539
out it's basically Community Driven

526
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:09,660
modern like tracking um Wi-Fi and

527
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,799
Bluetooth devices around the world

528
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,000
so

529
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
why do we pay for these things if we're

530
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,500
really doing all these great things

531
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,840
they're just making money hand over this

532
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,460
okay

533
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,340
so pay no attention to the mega buying

534
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,700
the curtain

535
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,240
so who owns these vpns

536
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,380
well

537
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,700
cape

538
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,179
owns Express cyberghost Zen mate as we

539
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,240
just looked at Pia or also known as

540
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,100
private internet access

541
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,580
they also own several affiliate sites or

542
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,620
reviewing sites if that's probably a

543
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,860
better term such as VPN mentor and whisk

544
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,860
case and I have this information if you

545
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,140
like it I probably had some more of the

546
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,780
links to this to show this out but

547
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,280
I'm not the only one that does this

548
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,659
research to find it out there but I'm

549
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,340
sure that not everybody here is going to

550
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,140
do all this investigation to find out

551
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,360
that hey why is this review site saying

552
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,640
these are the top ten because they own

553
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,960
them

554
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,840
wow

555
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,280
that's why I'm making so much money it's

556
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,658
fantastic well

557
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,419
so what's also really interesting about

558
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:28,380
Cape very specifically so they had this

559
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,760
thing called cross Rider which is

560
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,280
effectively a framework they've now very

561
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,100
recently shut it down but it basically

562
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,940
enabled uh malicious actors to be

563
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,520
Distributing malware and it also allowed

564
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,980
for ad injection through their vpns

565
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,080
God I love that

566
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,500
so because of enough people calling out

567
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,840
they turn it down they have obviously a

568
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,400
lot of money so they're buying a privacy

569
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,720
trying to figure out how to make

570
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,460
themselves look good but you can't

571
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,140
really clean all the blood off your

572
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,580
hands especially when you have a CIO

573
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,980
that literally worked for the United

574
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,559
Arab Emirates and it's wanted by the doj

575
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,299
which changed

576
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:11,760
basically he was able to get off and

577
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,020
still keep working there but this dude

578
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,360
think about this for a second if you are

579
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,220
the one that distributed the malware and

580
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,240
you're still working with this company

581
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,380
you work for UAE

582
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,200
still trust this guy

583
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,020
so anyway there's several other people

584
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,900
that work there that probably shouldn't

585
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,360
trust me so stay clear of these four

586
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,039
even though they say they may be

587
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,919
independent they've been buying a lot of

588
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,600
these providers

589
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,480
so

590
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,460
keep purchased expressvpn for the grand

591
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,260
total of

592
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,440
almost a billion dollars

593
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,559
why what VPN is ever worth that amount

594
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,240
of money

595
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,220
well obviously there's a very good

596
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,140
reason they have enough users and you

597
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,880
probably didn't know that all these vpns

598
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,380
are very similar in nature and have a

599
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,360
lot of that stuff

600
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,780
Nord is not an angel either

601
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,480
nor a surf shark oh they merged

602
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,480
so did and who Nord purchased Atlas VPN

603
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,100
not too long ago so now you have three

604
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,020
all kind of tied together

605
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,120
in fact North was also compromised in

606
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,159
2019 not too long been for having pretty

607
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:23,940
bad

608
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,700
security that's where the other Keys

609
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,320
stolen so that people can see it and

610
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,700
they kind of covered it up saying oh

611
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,260
well they only had access for about a

612
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,080
week and this oh okay I really still

613
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,640
believe you that you've had only an

614
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,140
access for a week it doesn't mean that

615
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,120
they didn't have it before nobody

616
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,100
noticed it for sure man

617
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,659
well

618
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:44,640
this is a shout out to my friend Yale

619
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,740
who actually inspired me to give this

620
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,460
talk at shmukh Khan because of

621
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,559
she works at consumer reports and said

622
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,700
and had this wonderful post and Nord had

623
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,159
one of the uh they're the they're very

624
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:00,840
big on privacy they actually say that

625
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,179
and they've had several audits done but

626
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:04,919
they actually performed the worst in

627
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,260
collecting too much information

628
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,740
imagine that God don't you just love how

629
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,480
they post all this stuff and have the

630
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,520
great external Audits and somehow they

631
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,960
still just

632
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,700
take it off

633
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,080
okay

634
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,360
zif Davis this is actually a really big

635
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,860
organization if you've never heard of it

636
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,480
they own quite a lot of things and they

637
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,140
kind of are like this big conglomerate

638
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,460
they own

639
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,919
soon to be three vpns including Courtney

640
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,240
if you've if you've heard of that strong

641
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,000
VPN IP damage well they also own

642
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,100
PC mag gear locker and Tech saver

643
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,679
another couple review sites that make it

644
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,240
look like

645
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,279
they're the best and they all kind of

646
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,960
work together in a way saying that hey

647
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,520
we know all of these providers but if

648
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,200
you're Consolidated the market that was

649
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,779
really only a couple big players

650
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,580
I'm sure I don't know if anybody here

651
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,320
uses most of these vpns but these are

652
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,679
the big ones and I'm sorry sounds like

653
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:00,360
phone carriers it's kind of like phone

654
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,279
carries everybody really just is owned

655
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:05,419
by somebody else is correct

656
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,440
um and so now

657
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,659
um well as I didn't know this until

658
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:13,320
literally yesterday Opera VPN what that

659
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,440
was owned uh surf easy is basically was

660
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,659
Opera however semantic just bought it

661
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:21,059
for a couple couple million dollars

662
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:24,000
so now semantic owns surfaces so now you

663
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,200
can see like everything's kind of like

664
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,059
this little hat

665
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:29,539
okay

666
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:33,379
it's no place like home

667
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,960
so I know I'm probably scared a little

668
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,220
bit at least you can now have an

669
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,320
understanding of which providers are

670
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,940
really bad I do have some

671
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,380
recommendations that I'll give you but

672
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,080
I'll probably be offhand but going into

673
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,320
this is rolling your own VPN actually

674
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,299
better there's Services out there like

675
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:54,120
algo VPN or you could set up openvpn at

676
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,520
your house or whatever it may be but is

677
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,100
it really better is it

678
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,320
open VPN is not the easiest thing in

679
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,299
here for a lot of people it might be if

680
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,100
you have like the PSX firewall that

681
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,960
could be fun you can poke around with it

682
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,000
if anything I'm going to absolutely

683
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,860
recommend wire guard for vast majority

684
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,600
people because it's in my if you're

685
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,460
technical enough it's really simple but

686
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,220
it's also the most secure in my opinion

687
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,760
out there right now but there's a couple

688
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,860
other Simple Solutions for you to check

689
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,360
out but those are going to be my two

690
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,700
favorite ones at this time

691
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,299
um

692
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:28,679
but what are you really trying to do

693
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,419
like what is what's the actual purpose

694
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,039
of you having it are you like trying to

695
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,200
disguise your location for streaming

696
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,240
is it like are you trying to bypass work

697
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,260
restrictions like is it uh what is the

698
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,700
actual purpose do you have in a VPN

699
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,080
because you know what who cares if

700
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,640
you're going to use express if literally

701
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,020
it's just you trying to disguise your

702
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,520
location even though they might be

703
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,260
snooping on your traffic or whatnot

704
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,000
because it's not like isps or anybody

705
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,279
doesn't do it anyway heck I mean there's

706
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,140
stingrays that'll literally monitor your

707
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,279
phone traffic

708
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,200
Okay so

709
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,539
don't be so paranoid but just also know

710
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,340
what your real use cases

711
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,539
so

712
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,880
I'll also recommend don't Pi don't buy

713
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,500
past work restrictions that stuff just

714
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,740
can get really busy really quickly

715
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,480
coming from like a defensive background

716
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,400
a lot of people are like oh I just don't

717
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,320
want my work to see all my traffic and

718
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,460
stuff well I know a lot of people work

719
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,980
remote work from home Etc but the thing

720
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,120
is

721
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,640
a lot of malicious actors out there love

722
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,179
to use vpns also so you are kind of now

723
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,400
one and the same as somebody that's

724
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,159
doing the bad stuff so maybe work with

725
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,440
your work to say hey this is what I'm

726
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,000
going to do maybe they'll open it up I

727
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,380
don't know how restrictive your policies

728
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,600
are but just throwing it out there a

729
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,400
different case would be maybe set up

730
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,960
your own VPN at home and then you can do

731
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,600
it that way but just be mindful of using

732
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,020
which Services you use

733
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,539
I'm sorry use your own equipment

734
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,820
always use your own equipment learn just

735
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,620
enough but obviously doesn't work for

736
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,419
our parents they're not going to be able

737
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:58,919
to figure this out and I know there are

738
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:00,299
solutions and I actually talk to

739
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,400
somebody uh right before the conference

740
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,260
even started that they're trying to work

741
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,120
on some services to make this easier for

742
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,279
people there are a bunch of things out

743
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,720
there that you can use kind of like a

744
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,539
Slingbox for your like a router like go

745
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:13,740
around the world and look like you're

746
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,840
always at home fantastic but somebody

747
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,059
like I said some of the vpns will try to

748
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,500
track where you're located anyway so

749
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,480
again know the purpose of what you're

750
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,360
going to be doing with you again

751
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,539
um and then like any iot device are you

752
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:31,440
ever updating your services if you're

753
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,840
going to be using openvpn there are

754
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,640
vulnerabilities all the time or just

755
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,679
constant misconfigurations that people

756
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,620
do thereby defeating why are you even

757
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,140
using the VPN in the first place so be

758
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,140
very mindful so this is why

759
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,460
if you're going to be doing anything

760
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,980
with a VPN by yourself be mindful of

761
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,539
what you're doing and just learn enough

762
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,000
about it and if that's not enough I'm

763
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,100
happy to give you some good resources to

764
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,659
help you figure some of that out but

765
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,700
just throwing that out there so I know I

766
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,899
scared you quite a bit

767
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,899
apologize but in that case

768
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:06,379
questions

769
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,220
excellent I love no questions this makes

770
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,899
me feel good sorry yes

771
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,520
so for me my recommendations to which is

772
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,200
the question of finding a good VPN

773
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,179
provider there's actually a couple of

774
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:26,820
good sites and in fact I really do

775
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,279
recommend Consumer Reports there are

776
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,279
they have they've analyzed a bunch of

777
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,740
different ones really in depth they've

778
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,320
they expose all of their techniques on

779
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,820
how to do that there's actually a couple

780
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,279
of sites out there that we'll check to

781
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,740
see if your VPN if you've did a trial

782
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,659
we'll test to see if there's a kill

783
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:48,899
switch if there's webrtc enabled even

784
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:51,659
give you a little bit of analysis on the

785
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,480
vpns themselves but in my opinion don't

786
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,399
check a lot of the review sites go to

787
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,399
like trusted and non-profit sort of

788
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,279
places that are really non-biased in my

789
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,799
opinion like that the consumer reports

790
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,179
is really non-biased in that way because

791
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,059
they're half Duty they're really their

792
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:10,200
feet are held at the fire they're

793
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,000
awesome that way

794
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,779
um

795
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:15,659
I personally don't trust anybody if

796
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:17,159
they're going to be trying to sell me an

797
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,440
affiliate thing on uh whether it's

798
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,840
YouTube or twitch that's just me there

799
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,059
are some people out there that will give

800
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:25,679
they basically bashed other people

801
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,779
saying oh well why isn't tour guard your

802
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:29,159
number one choice because you didn't

803
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:30,720
even put it on the list but like because

804
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,520
you're selling them dude

805
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,500
leave it alone

806
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,840
um but

807
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,179
that's that's my number one

808
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:41,460
um and there are some providers out

809
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,960
there that I will directly recommend

810
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,059
right away because they do expose their

811
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,100
internal audits they open source their

812
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,860
code for audits even down to like how

813
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,659
their keys are generated even though the

814
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,240
keys are always randomly made the whole

815
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,760
configuration and they'll give that so I

816
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,080
can tell that to you offhand I didn't

817
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,720
want it like I want to be very

818
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,580
independent on this I just want to bash

819
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,879
everybody

820
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:07,799
okay any more questions yes sir

821
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:08,460
um

822
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,080
it makes me nervous to use my personal

823
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,779
VPN but we use a corporate VPN that's

824
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,279
what I used a few over the years from

825
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:17,220
Cisco and ATT and like one anniversary

826
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,960
yes

827
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,360
um as far as those go are they pretty

828
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,120
solid or do those get out of date and

829
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,580
have compromises too

830
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,700
well if you've read any bit of the news

831
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,220
um F5 had a major vulnerability that

832
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,980
exposed basically compromise have the

833
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,279
internet because a lot of people use F5

834
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,779
there are some new like zero trust

835
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,520
Solutions out there that are trying to

836
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,039
be really good however it doesn't mean

837
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,240
that

838
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,520
everything is always secure

839
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,580
I mean in the case of F5 they had a

840
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,860
compromise they fixed it but that

841
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,360
doesn't mean actors weren't able to get

842
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,340
in and do whatever

843
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,919
um the problem is stuff the software is

844
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:00,600
made by humans will always have faults

845
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,399
Etc but there's only so much you could

846
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,200
possibly do have layered security you

847
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,059
could talk all day on the blue stuff uh

848
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,220
blue team stuff but

849
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,240
um

850
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,299
there are there are good Solutions I

851
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,159
mean it's using it is always in my

852
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,440
opinion good like you like there's any

853
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,179
connect out there open VPN but just have

854
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:19,620
somebody that understands enough about

855
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,360
setting up a VPN and make sure it's

856
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,580
always updated maybe rotate Keys every

857
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,240
so often because there's ways to do that

858
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,380
that's that's going to be your best

859
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,480
that's bad there there are solutions

860
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,120
that are trying to do like be good but

861
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,620
how many times have I found out there

862
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,360
that there's like a Cisco anyconnect at

863
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,299
this school that literally uses the Bare

864
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:41,460
Bones like

865
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,980
three years old you can think so many

866
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,960
people do that very few people ever like

867
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,419
try to update fast enough because they

868
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:50,539
don't

869
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,500
I don't know I wish I knew

870
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,620
you never want to change it once it's

871
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,539
working you're like okay great you only

872
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:04,919
change it when you have to and then

873
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,080
you're then you're terrified and that's

874
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,379
that pattern it's it's exactly it

875
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:13,080
because for work we're trying to we want

876
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,719
to secure our traffic going into like

877
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,489
all the systems and services and

878
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,520
[Music]

879
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,080
that's why I wanted to go more into the

880
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,280
commercial space and I can definitely

881
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,199
talk about how certain vpns or some of

882
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,418
them are good or some are them bad like

883
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:29,399
that's that's you know somebody's going

884
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:30,839
to kill me because I hate saying zero

885
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:32,280
trust but that's why things aren't going

886
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,960
that way you know that's like the new

887
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,020
term but at the same point that's not

888
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,599
Flawless at all but something's better

889
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,399
than nothing but just always be up to

890
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:42,839
date that's going to be my best

891
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:46,219
recommendation there so

892
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,839
any more questions oh yes

893
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,520
um some of these larger like legitimate

894
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,760
VPN providers that are still like very

895
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,099
much not respecting your privacy

896
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:57,720
um are there privacy policies at least

897
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,400
forthright with this like can they tell

898
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,260
you what they're doing with it or is it

899
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,900
kind of like Pretend We're not stealing

900
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,240
all those things

901
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,540
so are the large VPN providers saying

902
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,520
we're not really stealing your data or

903
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,560
what are we actually doing with it they

904
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,040
put forward a lot of great legal

905
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,000
documentation that says all the things

906
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,680
all these things in fact they put they

907
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,540
have external audits to make it look

908
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,700
really good but when you actually can

909
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,040
try to do some of them you know test it

910
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,460
you're like this isn't no or they at

911
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,260
they try to get additional permissions

912
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,900
over time like hey I need to have access

913
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,020
to this because if not I can't

914
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,480
work with Wi-Fi or whatever May whatever

915
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,400
reason right because our phones are the

916
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,380
worst phones are absolutely the worst

917
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,740
but it doesn't mean that uh

918
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,180
just because they had external audits

919
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,380
doesn't mean they can't lie to you in

920
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,220
those ways because there's certain

921
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,619
things they'll open source it but

922
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:54,320
um

923
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,480
how do you earn trust

924
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,760
is I think their goal they're trying to

925
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,980
be all privacy Centric trying to do all

926
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,859
this no logging these policies except

927
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:06,480
that then they say what the things they

928
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,660
do log and I'm like it's not one it's

929
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,820
one or the other it can't have no

930
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,040
logging and then say that you're also

931
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,020
logging like credit cards and stuff I

932
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,820
mean I it's it's a very interesting

933
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,780
practice

934
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,599
but um check out the audience I mean

935
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,800
that's probably the best thing if they

936
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,320
even have that or look at the times that

937
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,460
they were compromised because a lot of

938
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,140
that stuff gets very public and then you

939
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,480
can see like what's exposed or if you're

940
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,220
really interested in reverse engineering

941
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,560
let's poke around because that's

942
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,000
literally what I've been doing with this

943
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,740
and you're just like oh look at this all

944
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,520
right

945
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,680
and then my favorite one is like I was

946
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,260
telling you about how I found out some

947
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,240
of them after just sitting on the table

948
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,140
waiting sleep for x amount of time well

949
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,359
shocking that they like to use your

950
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,579
phone as a pivot point because that's

951
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,560
how they do it reverse proxies are

952
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,780
terrible

953
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,700
so kind of answer your question I guess

954
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,500
it's how do you hold their feet to the

955
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,740
fire well good question how I mean their

956
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,240
jurisdictions are in different countries

957
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,339
all around the world I mean

958
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:10,200
Nord like I said was out of Panama but

959
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,060
you have some that are based in Canada

960
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,820
you have some that are based in

961
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,280
Switzerland or wherever they may be and

962
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,079
those jurisdictions are very special but

963
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,960
the problem is when you have a VPN it

964
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,640
and then you get to choose where it is

965
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,020
you now have a very different

966
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,339
jurisdiction you're going to deal with

967
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:30,240
and just because they say oh we have no

968
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,460
logging even though we're a

969
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,520
we're based out of I don't know England

970
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,740
servers are still hijacked I mean

971
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,480
they've had like wingspara have had

972
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,599
their service literally seized by police

973
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,280
what do you do then you now have the

974
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,780
keys the entire infrastructure because

975
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,880
it was all on that box but you might not

976
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,200
know that who's going to be told they're

977
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,579
not going to be like oh yeah we've got

978
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,619
our boxes don't don't worry about it

979
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:55,740
they just it's such bad like of

980
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,300
visibility in their path so they just

981
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,500
don't want to tell it but if it gets

982
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,900
exposed it's out there I just happen to

983
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,160
read a lot so I know more about it

984
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,800
any more questions

985
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,460
yes sir

986
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,520
is there any place to go to read about

987
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,619
this well

988
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:18,660
for my news source my aggregator IU

989
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,880
speedly and I just happen to really

990
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,400
enjoy vpns and proxies and things like

991
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,960
that so that's why I read a lot about it

992
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,980
but

993
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,820
um

994
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,240
you if if you're interested in yours I

995
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,859
would just pop it in there or even

996
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:33,839
sometimes people use like the Google uh

997
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,480
like word thing not that I trust Google

998
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,119
but I know that they have that but you

999
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,560
could put that in there at any time that

1000
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,900
a certain company name gets popped up

1001
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,119
boom now you've got an alert on it

1002
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,800
because it's not like you can read the

1003
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,119
news every day but if you get an alert

1004
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,579
on it there you go so that's my

1005
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:54,000
recommendation there at least for that

1006
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,079
any more questions

1007
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,020
oh no this is an ongoing project for me

1008
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,720
because it's

1009
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,880
like any anybody that's hacking I

1010
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,440
thought it was just such a fun project

1011
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,119
over the years and I just keep I've just

1012
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,800
been working on it so I'm going to keep

1013
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,619
doing this for a long time I guess

1014
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,240
you can follow you you can follow me

1015
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,000
anytime stalk me I mean people you

1016
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,260
probably know more about me now after

1017
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,599
that OSN challenge then I know that you

1018
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,359
know about me that's creepy

1019
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:26,300
are you doing that fantastic

1020
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,980
well I want to I wish I could write like

1021
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,480
a whole white paper on this stuff I

1022
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,099
think it'd be really fantastic but I'm

1023
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:35,160
also really lazy so I'm sorry

1024
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,800
but it's a lot of it's in the slides so

1025
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,900
with that zygen goodbye matinee

1026
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,300
um please if you can I'd love feedback

1027
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,040
on this if there's any more I can add to

1028
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,200
this I really greatly appreciate it

1029
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,400
because I really think I want to make

1030
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,440
this a bit bigger I don't know if I hit

1031
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,480
an hour or not probably not about 40

1032
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,920
minutes so I did exactly the right time

1033
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,980
so you guys could all go home

1034
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,680
um but I'm really here to help I want to

1035
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,260
make this talk better so if there's

1036
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,420
something that I can add whether it's um

1037
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,339
working on like corporate vpns maybe

1038
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,839
I'll work on adding some of that because

1039
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,400
that might actually be a fantastic thing

1040
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,160
maybe better if I could like come up

1041
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,660
with better solutions for you that might

1042
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,640
be a good thing too but um you can find

1043

way or if you want to tweet me but I

1045
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,480

00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,200
