00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,479
to put on an incredible event like this

22
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,040
uh every year and um

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,920
yeah so um

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,280
first of all uh my name is amy um i'm a

25
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,079
milwaukee-based audio engineer musician

26
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,399
and uh now i'm currently a tech

27
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,079
apprentice at uh concurrency

28
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,119
and i like to make things

29
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,159
especially music and today we are going

30
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,880
to talk about one of the most exciting

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,840
music making tools i've ever come across

32
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,400
it is a coding platform called sonic pi

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,080
tonight we're going to explore the use

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,400
of the sonic pi live coding environment

35
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,040
as a means of using code to

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,239
create music as well as uh

37
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,640
to provide an accessible gateway into

38
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,959
more complex coding environments for for

39
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,400
people who might not have a background

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,920
in coding or programming or anything

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,879
like that

42
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,000
um

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,920
we'll also talk a little bit about the

44
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,760
community that's growing around sonic

45
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,800
pie um and how much creative potential

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,160
exists there and i i i ventured to guess

47
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,760
that a lot of people in this room and a

48
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
lot of people that have been uh involved

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,959
in cyphercon would really um

50
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,800
also get excited about about this

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,370
community

52
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,280
[Music]

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
so like i said

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,440
i like making things

55
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,080
and because i like making things

56
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,360
i am drawn to all things diy

57
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,680
um that's you know diys and do it

58
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,800
yourself

59
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,840
uh the process the mentality and the

60
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,120
community

61
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,959
um

62
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,159
so diy is a lot of things to me it's

63
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,000
both a daily

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,239
practice and a framework

65
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,280
for exploring the world but diy is also

66
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,799
a music scene

67
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,959
that uses social media and grassroots

68
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,480
organizing to put on tours and shows all

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,879
around the world spanning a probably

70
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,840
infinite amount of genres

71
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,200
diy is a community as well

72
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,760
it's a global community of artists

73
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,560
musicians audio engineers booking agents

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,280
promoters small business owners

75
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,560
um

76
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,200
visual artists crafts people filmmakers

77
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,720
anybody creative basically

78
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,720
that would rather take matters into

79
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,799
their own hands then relies solely on

80
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,360
the systems that society provides for

81
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,640
connection and artistic expression

82
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,439
diy also includes makers

83
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,640
i think

84
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,200
a lot of people here are would consider

85
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,519
themselves to be makers who experiment

86
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,759
with making uh making things using new

87
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,479
technology or finding new applications

88
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,800
for technology that's already there

89
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,600
um and i do consider myself to be a

90
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,800
maker

91
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,440
i make music in local bands

92
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,560
i also make music as a

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,880
producer and audio engineer doing

94
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,520
recording and mixing and

95
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,520
from from different local and regional

96
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,320
and national acts

97
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,919
and i also

98
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,360
i also make community through um

99
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,800
through my uh involvement in putting on

100
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,280
shows in the local music scene as well

101
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,040
as kind of in the

102
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,800
midwest region

103
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,240
um

104
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,320
and i i love to

105
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,440
contribute to community via uh workshops

106
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,400
with about where i can share my uh my

107
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,759
knowledge and my passion with other

108
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,680
people um

109
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,880
so

110
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,440
and lastly lastly i make technology

111
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,000
solutions too by day

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,240
but yeah so today

113
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,240
um i want to talk about sonic pi as a

114
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,800
fun way to make music

115
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,680
um

116
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,600
and and like i mentioned earlier an

117
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,400
accessible gateway to learn coding um

118
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,960
there's lots of uh

119
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,639
it's a great way and it was a great way

120
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,280
for me personally to learn the basics of

121
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,360
of different object-oriented programming

122
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,479
principles and logic um and uh like i

123
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,720
said the community is really exciting

124
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,520
so

125
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,440
uh basically my goal today is

126
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,319
whether you're a master programmer or

127
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,880
who's never even homed an original tomb

128
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,680
or um a brilliant musician who can

129
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
barely even log into facebook to promote

130
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,080
your next show that you leave this

131
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,759
session confident that you have all the

132
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,759
knowledge that you need to make your

133
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,600
very own music using sonic pie

134
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,880
so

135
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,960
live coded music

136
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,199
takes a lot of shapes and forms

137
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,800
but before we kind of get into the

138
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,199
nitty-gritty of it i want to show you a

139
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,280
clip of a really cool live-coded

140
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,479
performance

141
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,360
um by uh

142
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,360
somebody named mxs

143
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
that they um

144
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
do we have any daft punk fans in the

145
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,560
room yes right on yeah so this is a code

146
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,039
cover of aerodynamics by

147
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,039
uh by daft punk

148
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,120
i won't play the whole thing but i will

149
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,360
play a little bit of it and

150
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,840
here we go

151
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,080
and i won't talk through the whole thing

152
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,000
but this is a great chance to take a

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,240
look at what the actual ide looks like

154
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,020
uh

155
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,099
[Music]

156
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,800
and the way this person structured

157
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,080
this song

158
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,319
they're using the live looping

159
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,759
functionality that we'll talk a little

160
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,360
bit about as we get into it

161
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,520
to add and take away different

162
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,120
components as

163
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,199
indicated in

164
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,479
the the parameters that they're

165
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,860
specifying in the code here

166
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,949
[Music]

167
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:47,760
[Music]

168
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,040
all right so you kind of get the idea of

169
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,440
uh kind of you can really maximize the

170
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,880
sounds that you're making with this

171
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,200
program um you can strip it back and

172
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,839
just have one one melodic layer going on

173
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,920
there's lots of different things uh that

174
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,959
you can do

175
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,000
um

176
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,040
so

177
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,120
but first uh before i show you how to

178
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,160
actually set up uh writing songs in

179
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,680
sonic pi

180
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,519
let's talk just a little bit about what

181
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,760
exactly it is and how it works

182
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,160
and where it came from

183
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,959
so

184
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,160
first of all

185
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,360
it's super easy to get uh started and

186
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,800
set up

187
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,120
um

188
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,080
so before i kind of get into this all uh

189
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,550
we'll

190
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,000
[Music]

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,160
as far as making music with sonic pie

192
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,080
goes um i'll show you how easy it is to

193
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
get started we'll go over some of the

194
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,640
basic music concepts that are helpful to

195
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,600
understand going into it um

196
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,120
we'll talk about just the the basic

197
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,880
computing requirements and then we'll

198
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,519
make some noise um

199
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,440
and we'll we'll do the basics and then

200
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,959
get into some of the fun stuff like

201
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,360
looping and thread sinking

202
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,399
um

203
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,959
yeah so it's a free download from

204
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,839
sonicpi.net

205
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,720
all you need is a laptop that can run it

206
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
or a computer that can run it it runs on

207
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,680
mac windows linux raspberry pi

208
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,880
um

209
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,480
and all you need is something to type

210
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,959
the code and an audio out which is a

211
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,600
pretty big departure from you know i i

212
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,079
if anyone has ever seen like a full dj

213
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,800
setup with with turntables or or

214
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,079
whatever kind of controller they're

215
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,880
using all i brought today was a laptop

216
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,360
case and it was it was awesome i've

217
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,920
carried a lot of amps up a lot of scary

218
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,399
stairs that you know people shouldn't be

219
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,320
carrying heavy things up and down

220
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,839
uh so

221
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,519
i like this load in and load out a lot

222
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,680
better um

223
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,839
but yeah

224
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,200
so let's just talk about some of the

225
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,760
music concepts that are helpful um the

226
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,920
way that playing notes works uh you can

227
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,079
play notes two different ways um you can

228
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,160
either use note numbers so that's just

229
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,040
based on which number key on a keyboard

230
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,360
it would be

231
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,399
or you can specify note names like c

232
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,720
c d e whatever

233
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,880
and the octave that you're playing them

234
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,040
in

235
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,279
chords and scales

236
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,360
are very fun to play with very cool to

237
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,720
play with you can do lots of different

238
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,519
things iterating through the the scales

239
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,800
um depending on how you want to sequence

240
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,320
your notes

241
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,399
and you can play chords

242
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,399
and chords are essentially just

243
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,160
groupings of notes that are in the same

244
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,279
key that

245
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,839
uh played the uh

246
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,800
the

247
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,320
we don't need to get too into music

248
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,240
theory here but it's usually the the

249
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,800
first third and fifth of of the

250
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,560
of the scale and the key that you're in

251
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,200
and then um kind of understanding bpm so

252
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,040
tempo how fast how slow your song is

253
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,880
going to be is really helpful uh

254
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,240
something that i love to do when i'm

255
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,880
writing in in sonic pi is

256
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,480
i'll write a whole song in one uh one

257
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,320
time signature not time signature but

258
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,040
one tempo and then i'll either speed it

259
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,639
way up or slow it way down just to see

260
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,440
what it sounds like and sometimes uh

261
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,120
you know you end up writing two songs at

262
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,800
once that way

263
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,440
um so let's get into making some noise

264
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,120
um i

265
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,760
will do my best to do this with one hand

266
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,000
um

267
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,600
so

268
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,760
when you want to play some notes

269
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,399
[Music]

270
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,959
all you do is type the word play and

271
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,079
then

272
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,839
which note you want to play and then you

273
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,000
run it

274
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,320
that's one note all i did was you know

275
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,839
say play 70.

276
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,920
you can also

277
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,440
like i said

278
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,000
specify the note name with a letter

279
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,160
like that

280
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,079
um

281
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,920
when you

282
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,599
run two notes at the same time

283
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,600
we'll just play both notes that i just

284
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,839
played

285
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,079
they're played at the same time so you

286
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,079
need to set the time between notes if

287
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,720
you want to play a sequence of notes and

288
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,160
that is just setting a sleep parameter

289
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,639
so it pauses the program essentially for

290
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,680
however much time you tell it to

291
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,920
um i have it set for one which is just

292
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,479
one second

293
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,480
and there you go that's how to play

294
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,760
simple notes

295
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,440
um

296
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,440
so

297
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,760
playing chords is just as easy um it's a

298
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,920
a theme that you'll see here is that

299
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,760
if if you have a background in coding

300
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,720
the coding part is the easy part um

301
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,079
and that's kind of the whole point is

302
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,000
that this is such a great gateway into

303
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,600
learning uh

304
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,560
harder coding things so um to play a

305
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,160
chord you just call it like you would

306
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,600
call a method

307
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,800
um

308
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,959
chord and then specify

309
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,680
which root of the which root note you

310
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,560
want the chord to be so here it's e3 so

311
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,480
that's in the third octave on the the

312
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,000
keyboard or whatever

313
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,800
um

314
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,160
and

315
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,839
in this particular case it's going to be

316
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,360
a minor seventh chord so we're going to

317
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,760
get a little jazzy

318
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,720
but if you want to play a chord

319
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,320
where the notes are separated so an

320
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,560
arpeggio chord

321
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,160
you can do that by just saying play

322
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,560
pattern chord

323
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,440
[Music]

324
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,360
and there you go so that's chords for

325
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,079
you

326
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,720
um that's uh as far as songwriting goes

327
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,079
those are

328
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,360
really good um kind of tenants of

329
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,760
building a rhythm section that's you can

330
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,600
use it for like kind of like i think of

331
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,680
things in terms of like

332
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,279
uh analog bands so i i use chords a lot

333
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,839
for like rhythm guitar sections i mean

334
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,199
it's not a rhythm guitar it's a

335
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,120
synthesizer sound making the sound but

336
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,760
it kind of translates in the same way

337
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,199
um

338
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,199
like i said you can also play scales

339
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,600
uh in this case

340
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,399
it's gonna start on c it's gonna be a

341
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,040
major chord

342
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,360
it will span five octaves

343
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
this is the sleep time so this was the

344
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,120
space between the notes

345
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,920
and the release time is set very low so

346
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,600
these are just the parameters that

347
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,639
define how it's going to sound

348
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,199
the release being so low this is going

349
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,279
to be a very staccato sounding scale so

350
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,740
here you go

351
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,769
[Music]

352
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,959
yeah

353
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,680
so you can change uh

354
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,000
so many different parameters

355
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,920
of pretty much anything just like in any

356
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,680
coding language

357
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,839
but um

358
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,360
one of the main things that's fun to

359
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,920
play with is the release time so that's

360
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,839
just the the length of the note that

361
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,880
you're playing um we just heard a super

362
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,720
short release time let's get a longer

363
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,720
one

364
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,000
and we'll just hold it out for four

365
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,240
seconds like that

366
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,399
so those are the basics the very basics

367
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,639
of playing notes

368
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,000
you can also

369
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,480
there are a ton of samples that have

370
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,160
been actually loaded into the program

371
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,279
that you can

372
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,000
call on from a library that's stored in

373
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,079
um in the program

374
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,600
um

375
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,360
and that's where you get um

376
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,079
like the beat making functionality so

377
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,360
i'll just show you

378
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,920
uh this is just a sample of

379
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,120
a basic um

380
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,000
backbeat i'm gonna use a different

381
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,600
bass sound bass drum sound so here is a

382
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,000
bass drum that i am using so you

383
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,399
basically just say sample

384
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,040
and then it'll give you

385
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,360
a list of all the different samples that

386
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
you can choose from

387
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,119
which is very helpful

388
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,839
and here you go

389
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,919
so obviously just playing it like that

390
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,079
is cool but you can't really do much

391
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,119
with it

392
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,880
which is where some of the more

393
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,439
interesting things uh in in how to use

394
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,280
the code come into play

395
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,900
um

396
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,599
[Music]

397
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,119
so the first

398
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,679
thing that i think is kind of a function

399
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,480
uh

400
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,799
that's capital f u n fun

401
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,160
is

402
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,400
looping that's kind of the core of all

403
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,799
of the live coding elements

404
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,039
you can use these looping functions to

405
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,200
build on each other

406
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
and create lots of different layers of

407
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,080
sound as you heard in the daft punk song

408
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,440
they were using the live looping

409
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,120
function that's set up slightly

410
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,520
different from just a normal loop a loop

411
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,120
will just play through and through and

412
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,400
through you can't really tie it to

413
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,080
anything else we'll talk a little bit

414
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,559
about the the sinking that you can do

415
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,039
with live looping uh in a little bit but

416
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,520
this is just a normal loop that you can

417
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,919
run through and play with it however you

418
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,160
want to

419
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,320
i will also say that uh as a

420
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,440
i play

421
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
uh other instruments too it's it but i

422
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,840
don't play drums so it's really fun to

423
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,120
be able to

424
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,440
just throw together a really quick beat

425
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,480
to just play along to

426
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:30,720
yeah

427
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,120
[Music]

428
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,000
so that's uh how to loop samples you can

429
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,320
loop anything though you can loop

430
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,720
notes

431
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,919
i'm gonna loop the same scale that i

432
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,310
played just a few minutes ago

433
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,349
[Music]

434
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,160
and i'll just go on and on and on

435
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,160
forever until the program crashes

436
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,480
um yeah so

437
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,559
sonic pi has a ton of really cool synth

438
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,760
voicings built into it um i

439
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,600
think that

440
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,720
is it's some of the the most interesting

441
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,640
stuff that you can play with on here i

442
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,080
mean i am the kind of person that i'll

443
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,760
sit in front of a keyboard and just play

444
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,600
every single sound to the point where

445
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,960
i'm like oh i could have played piano

446
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,240
but i was just listening the sounds i

447
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,400
could make um so i'll just show you a

448
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,720
few different uh voicings that that you

449
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,640
can play with uh we'll start with blade

450
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,840
which is one of my favorite ones

451
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,760
there's a lot of cool

452
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,840
kind of like um vintage sounding

453
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,880
like vintage sounding

454
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,360
synth sounds that you can play with

455
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,280
um yeah so there's lots of different

456
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,679
specifics that you can play with but the

457
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,799
core of all this uh for me at least is

458
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,760
how much of a springboard into other

459
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,360
types of coding this program is

460
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,880
i

461
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,720
started using this program about three

462
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,240
years ago

463
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,200
not long before i met michael

464
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,960
and when he asked me to give this

465
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,080
presentation and i had no previous

466
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,320
coding experience at all

467
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,720
my background was in audio visual stuff

468
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,760
um

469
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,320
and uh but i was kind of at a point in

470
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,720
my life where i wanted to kind of turn

471
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,559
into a more of a programming uh path but

472
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,400
i didn't know how and it was really hard

473
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,919
to kind of learn

474
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,159
just the basics and the fundamentals um

475
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,000
without having the background of okay

476
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,120
like how does

477
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,440
basic logic work you know stuff like

478
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,200
that and

479
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,679
since i you know had this background in

480
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,159
music i understood how to put together

481
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,559
drum loops and and build songs in the

482
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,120
way that you build songs in this program

483
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,320
um

484
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,000
and having that background kind of

485
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,280
helped me

486
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,799
understand

487
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,880
the the coding concepts more so so

488
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,880
some of the cool things in here that

489
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,840
like

490
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,360
it would have probably taken me months

491
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,280
longer to understand as i was learning

492
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,520
you know java and python and stuff like

493
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,960
that um

494
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,440
i being able to hear immediately what

495
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,840
was going on in like

496
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,000
iterations and

497
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,039
like using conditionals and defining

498
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,600
functions and using variables

499
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,799
and um kind of figuring out how how that

500
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,240
actually applies

501
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,840
um that's what

502
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,520
that's where the value really lies in

503
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,960
this program for me

504
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,400
um

505
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,159
we only have a couple of minutes left

506
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,760
here so i i don't want to get too into

507
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,960
uh the the code demonstration but

508
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,120
i will take a look

509
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,600
i think that one of the the examples

510
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,520
that i have kind of

511
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,880
um

512
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,600
kills a few birds with one stone

513
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,360
uh i mentioned that the

514
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,880
the thread sinking is a really cool

515
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,280
function um

516
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,840
let's see

517
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,480
this doesn't happen okay

518
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,919
um

519
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,060
yeah we will use this one so

520
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,240
[Music]

521
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,320
this code sample

522
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,440
uses thread sinking um basically you set

523
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,080
up a live loop this is the

524
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,039
the court like the

525
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,880
i forgot to comment out the last one

526
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,880
sorry

527
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,289
[Music]

528
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,480
all right

529
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,240
so we'll we'll just build this up and

530
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,600
i'll kind of explain what i'm doing as

531
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,320
i'm doing it for for 10 sake

532
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,559
so this is the back beat i usually start

533
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,919
with the back backbeat just because it's

534
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,200
easy to

535
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,400
think everything else to it

536
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,120
i already showed you a loop like this

537
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,960
[Music]

538
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,039
so this next loop when i run it

539
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,559
since it's synced

540
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,840
uh as indicated in that as line 221 um

541
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,679
the timing will

542
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,799
match up

543
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,919
uh rather than just going on top of it

544
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,840
in the way that a normal loop

545
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,840
now the next

546
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,080
loop that i'm gonna tie in here also

547
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,400
uses some effects there are a ton of

548
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,080
really cool effects that you can play it

549
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,280
with in here um you can use like reverb

550
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,840
and delays and there's a really cool fit

551
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840
crusher function that makes everything

552
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,000
sound like an 8-bit song that i like to

553
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,480
play with

554
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,640
this this next loop uses a pan slicer

555
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,799
which is kind of cool so

556
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,200
if if this is run stereo you'll hear it

557
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,919
going back and forth

558
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,000
and then this last live loop down here

559
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,600
that i'm about to add in when i run it

560
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,360
again actually uses some variables um it

561
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,159
uses some logic it chooses notes from

562
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,880
this collection

563
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,400
that's the kind of melodic line going on

564
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,640
there

565
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,760
all right

566
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,880
so

567
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,960
that is it for the the code

568
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,240
demonstration

569
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,799
um but to to kind of just tie things up

570
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,320
here um i guess if any of this sounds

571
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,080
interesting to you please

572
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,000
uh check it out download it make some

573
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,240
noise you'll be if you know how to code

574
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,880
you'll be making music in five minutes

575
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,000
and it's it's really cool um like i

576
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,559
mentioned there's there's a really big

577
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,000
online community um for this program

578
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,480
uh there it's it's all over the place

579
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,640
it's it's on twitch it's they do a lot

580
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,000

live streams on twitch and youtube

582
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,880

583
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,279
