[Music]

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,700
thank you

3
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:29,238
[Music]

4
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,218
all right

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,460
foreign

6
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,240
so today at Bitcoin another

7
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,040
cryptocurrency of turn hingers into

8
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,619
money back in the 90s when TGT was

9
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,119
bringing a strong crypto to the masses

10
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,580
integers were classified as Munitions by

11
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,439
a government who who sought to control

12
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,200
who wielded them uh and before that one

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,360
could say that integers were just math

14
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,360
but in the 1500s integers were Magic

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,220
this presentation is about cryptography

16
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,780
and medieval and early modern Europe

17
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,400
from the 13th century through the

18
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,560
Renaissance into the middle of the 1700s

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,900
and the use of cryptography by magicians

20
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,720
Alchemists and occultists

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,600
but why you asked because so many

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,920
discussions on the history of

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,420
cryptography skipped straight from the

24
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,100
ancient world to the 19th century

25
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,380
touching only briefly if at all on the

26
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,000
numerous developments in between

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,740
by paying attention to this overlooked

28
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,540
Middle Ground we can uncover some of the

29
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,159
most interesting stories cryptography

30
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,340
has taught has played a part in uh I

31
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,079
chose to focus on the use of crypto by

32
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,060
non-nation state actors because when you

33
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,318
step away from examining how

34
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,599
nation-states use crypto and look at how

35
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,580
individuals Kept Secrets it becomes much

36
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,920
more personal and to me that often makes

37
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,900
for more interesting stories and I

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,220
specifically chose to examine how

39
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,720
magicians Alchemists and other

40
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,580
subversives use crypto during this time

41
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,200
both because they intrinsically had

42
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,060
something to hide and because I find

43
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,260
them to be some of history's most

44
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,780
colorful characters

45
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,700
we're going to start with steganography

46
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,560
which probably seems like an odd place

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,940
for a presentation covering a time

48
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,800
period centuries before computers were

49
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,840
invented most of us probably know

50
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,580
steganography as a modern Capture the

51
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,620
Flag stable you have a standard image

52
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,540
file and by manipulating the binary data

53
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,340
within the image you can conceal text or

54
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,640
other files of it or inside of it and

55
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,200
not know that anything is contained

56
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,940
within it unless you know that something

57
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,099
is hiding within if you know that an

58
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,540
image is serving as a carrier for a

59
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,580
stego payload you can extract it but the

60
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,900
trick is knowing that the data is hidden

61
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,879
there in the first place so why would

62
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,160
you want to do this well cryptography

63
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,280
stands out a lot it's obvious when data

64
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,720
is encrypted and sometimes you want to

65
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,879
fly under the radar I mean look at how

66
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,019
uncomfortable that person in the

67
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,659
background looks awkward this is your

68
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,459
conspicuously encrypted traffic on a

69
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,060
common medium

70
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,040
steganography on the other hand is like

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,900
burying a needle in a haystack except

72
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,760
the needle is also made of hay the

73
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,220
Secret's hidden in plain sight

74
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,959
now I'm talking about stego right now

75
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,760
because the origin of both the idea and

76
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,860
the term steganography are much older

77
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,959
than digital image carriers well an

78
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,760
article on steganography talks about its

79
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,379
history it usually talks about ancient

80
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,900
Greece and Persia in one story and as it

81
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,940
was carved into the wood beneath the wax

82
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,739
on a writing tablet and then covered

83
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,239
over with wax again so it could be

84
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,459
smuggled across the border on notice in

85
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,080
another story a message was tattooed

86
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,640
onto the shaved head of a slave who was

87
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,900
sent to deliver the message once his

88
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,940
hair grew back but it's surprising how

89
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,680
often discussions of steganography's

90
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,659
History completely ignore the source

91
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,159
that the term steganography actually

92
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,019
came from

93
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,420
the word steganography was invented by

94
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,400
Johannes strathemius a Benedictine

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,459
Abbott in the German County of sponheim

96
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,019
trademius was a prolific historian a

97
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,000
cryptographer and a nicultist and

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,220
magician he wrote the steganographia

99
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,060
where he first coined the term in 1499.

100
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,220
the stegnography is trithinius's most

101
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,160
famous work or perhaps his most infamous

102
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,440
although he wrote it in 1499 it wasn't

103
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,020
published until 1606 and it was placed

104
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,699
on the index of prohibited books just

105
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,040
three years later while tredemius was

106
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,780
still alive rumor of the book spread

107
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,880
outside of the abbeyan game gained him a

108
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,040
notorious reputation For Better or For

109
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,440
Worse the second of Gracia was written

110
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,419
in three volumes and on its surface it

111
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,220
was a book of magic instructing the

112
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,199
reader about various angels to invoke in

113
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,880
order to transmit messages over long

114
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,160
distances but there were also other

115
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,960
texts hidden Within These instructions

116
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,660
the key to uncovering the stego payloads

117
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,280
in the first two volumes was published

118
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,860
in 1606 along with the rest of the word

119
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,900
the key to uncovering the stego payloads

120
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,400
within the third book wouldn't be

121
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,860
uncovered until 1996 almost three

122
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,660
centuries later when two researchers

123
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,880
independently discovered its secrets

124
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,400
the mingling of magic and Mathematics of

125
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560
cryptography and Conjuring wasn't unique

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,660
to the stigma gracio it was a common

127
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,139
feature in Renaissance European Magic

128
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,240
why might a Renaissance magician like to

129
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,740
hide secret messages and otherwise

130
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,100
unassuming text gee I don't know maybe

131
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,020
because Cipher alphabets look super

132
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,180
obvious whereas the steganographic

133
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,979
technique such as the Ave Maria Cipher

134
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,539
results in text that just looks like a

135
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,759
bad Latin poem or hem and people who

136
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,900
would give you the side eye when they

137
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,580
see your super occult looking ciphers

138
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,020
aren't going to spare a second glance at

139
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,260
your crappy Church poetry

140

[Music]

141
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,419
after in the first two volumes of the

142
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,340
steganographia discusses a single Spirit

143
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,440
the initial letters of certain words

144
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,419
spell out the hidden text the specific

145
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:55,979
words that are significant change in

146
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:57,479
each chapter

147
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,520
the hidden text in each chapter details

148
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,560
a different method of cryptography these

149
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,060
range from what are positioned ciphers

150
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,100
to alphabet shifts similar to the Caesar

151
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,560
cipher book three which consists of a

152
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,360
single chapter covers substitution

153
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,180
ciphers via numeric tables given that

154
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,280
you had the these texts of angelic magic

155
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,960
which claim to tell people how to

156
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,520
mystically communicate messages over

157
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,919
long distances and these texts in turn

158
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,780
can steal other instructions on how to

159
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,699
write hidden messages so that they can

160
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,560
be sent to others in secret at a certain

161
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,360
point when discussing the steganographia

162
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,639
you have to ask the question is this

163
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,560
book a work of Occult Philosophy and

164
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,419
technique or is it primarily a work of

165
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,460
cryptography merely disguised as Angel

166
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,900
magic

167
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,860
the answer is it turns out is yes

168
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,840
even posing this question as a binary

169
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,120
either or either or a choice is a

170
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,220
modernist and anachronistic View and the

171
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,259
dichotomy would have been foreign the

172
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,020
pre-modern sensibility is oftenius's era

173
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,880
we construct our ideas of Truth today

174
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,979
based on exclusion there's one truth

175
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,479
which excludes there being any others

176
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,160
but ideas of Truth in meeting and

177
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,479
pre-modernity were much more

178
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,039
multi-layered in nuanced than we give

179
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,240
them credit for

180
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,639
if the Stango Gracia were only a work of

181
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,740
cryptography truthemias could easily

182
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,360
have exonerated himself against his

183
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,639
unsavory reputation as a magician so his

184
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,199
failure to do so leads us to consider

185
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,819
that perhaps something more was going on

186
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,280
here furthermore his documented

187
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,840
corresponds with Heinrich Cornelius

188
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,460
Agrippa author of The even more

189
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,780
notorious Three Books of Occult

190
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,400
Philosophy which is a genuine

191
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,680
and if you remember that the pre-modern

192
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,479
worldview didn't look at things the same

193
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,880
way that we do today for example how

194
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,900
many of you who have heard of the

195
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,759
doctrine of signatures

196
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,639
any any does any of that ring a bell

197
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,440
from science class back in you know

198
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,020
early High School Middle School

199
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,880
the doctrine of signatures was this idea

200
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,500
that hidden meanings are concealed in

201
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,240
nature and that by looking at the

202
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,099
appearance or correspondences of certain

203
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,620
plants rocks herbs and the like you

204
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,819
could tell what those items would be

205
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,039
good for for example it used to be

206
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,360
thought that walnuts were good for

207
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,340
disorders or diseases of the brain

208
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,259
because walnuts look a little like a

209
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,000
brain in their appearance

210
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,580
seems ridiculous to us today right but

211
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,020
back then this method seemed as pride

212
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,580
and tested for the best scientific minds

213
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,020
of the day as anything modern science

214
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,120
has to offer and people back then were

215
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,919
no less intelligent or astute than they

216
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,360
are today they just had a different

217
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,160
philosophical foundation for how to

218
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,720
construct knowledge

219
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,160
the fact of the matter is that early

220
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,840
science was heavily influenced by

221
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,240
Imagine magic and occultism and the two

222
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,319
continued to have a much more

223
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,000
complicated and less distinct or

224
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,680
separate relationship for quite some

225
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,020
time when people today generally think

226
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,880
this Viewpoint was apparently Universal

227
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,679
at least within the esoteric worldview

228
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,719
which was also largely the world view of

229
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,940
Renaissance humanism and early science

230
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,279
This Magic versus science dichotomy the

231
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,520
idea that these two are somehow separate

232
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,080
is a modern idea and it wasn't shared by

233
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,000
Renaissance thinkers these subtleties

234
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,560
mean that the assumptions we bring to

235
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,120
the table with our modern perspectives

236
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,620
can often lead us to incorrect

237
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,899
conclusions or at least incomplete ones

238
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,880
when we look at pre-modern culture even

239
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,140
when we're talking about something like

240
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,480
cryptography so keep that in mind as we

241
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,920
turn to look to another Mainstay of

242
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,480
medieval and Renaissance magic the

243
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,000
cipher alphabet

244
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,740
these are some of the cipher alphabets

245
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,420
that were commonplace in the 16th

246
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,220
century and earlier they occur

247
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,779
frequently in magical texts of the time

248
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,060
some of you may even recognize Eben

249
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,680
which was first published in Johannes

250
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,680
krithemia's polygraphia in 1518 from its

251
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,360
modern use in Wicca and other flavors of

252
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,519
neopic and religion most of these

253
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,899
ciphers work helped on specific

254
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,580
alphabets which is to say that the

255
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,740
characters of the cipher alphabet mapped

256
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,660
directly onto the characters of a given

257
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,399
language and medieval and Renaissance

258
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,380
magic that was generally Latin Hebrew or

259
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,360
Arabic

260
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,220
the witch hunts in Europe had their

261
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,860
birth in the 1420s and 1430s with the

262
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,480
most famous of the witch-hunting manuals

263
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,700
malius malachikara or witch's hammer

264
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,459
having them published in 1487. in light

265
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:48,899
of this it seems unsurprising The

266
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,160
Magicians would want to collect their

267
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,540
books with ciphers that would allow them

268
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,459
to disguise the nature of the texts and

269
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,839
conceal them from the authorities and

270
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,160
from others who were hostile to Natural

271
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,279
Pursuits and indeed these ciphers occur

272
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,899
frequently in natural texts at the time

273
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,060
but it's curious that these ciphers seem

274
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,220
to be exclusively mono-alphabetic at a

275
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,959
time when frequency analysis was well

276
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,820
known having first been documented by

277
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,220
alkindi himself a magician around the

278
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,019
start of the 10th century and when

279
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,940
homophonic and nomenclature ciphers were

280
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,360
state of the art for protecting secrets

281
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,220
one could argue this was less of an

282
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,779
issue in time when literacy wasn't

283
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,640
widespread and the printing press was

284
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,920
still new while literacy is very

285
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,720
difficult to Define for the time period

286
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,000
and equally difficult to estimate the

287
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,740
Latin literacy rate at the time was

288
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,680
maybe about two percent or so and prior

289
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,880
to the invention of the printing press

290
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,820
in 1440 even University libraries seldom

291
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,200
had more than a thousand books in their

292
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,360
collections Monastery libraries were

293
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,880
only a fraction of this size by contrast

294
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,820
the uw-milwaukee library holds over 2.7

295
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,860
million physical volumes and the

296
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,360
University of Minnesota libraries house

297
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,820
over 8.2 million depending on which

298
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,320
estimate you go with that number may

299
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,700
have equaled or exceeded the total

300
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,140
number of books printed across the

301
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,180
entirety of Western Europe by the year

302
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,820
1500. if the techniques of frequency

303
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,860
analysis weren't widely disseminated due

304
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,480
to the scarce availability of books on

305
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,220
the subject this might have mitigated

306
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,899
the risk inherent in using an easily

307
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,420
broken Cipher until well in the 16th

308
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,980
century or at the very least made The

309
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,300
Magicians who were trying to conceal

310
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,160
their secrets less likely to be aware of

311
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,019
such techniques

312
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,300
but regardless if the authorities are a

313
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,860
part of your threat model

314
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,839
this still isn't an effective way to

315
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,720
hide from them and this also doesn't fit

316
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,100
with what we know about how these

317
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,980
ciphers were actually used in practice

318
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,240
rather than being used to obfuscate

319
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,579
entire texts in practice the ciphers

320
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,680
were used rather sparingly they were

321
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,540
used within magical books primarily for

322
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,519
the names of spirits for the texted

323
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,380
invocations and for characters to be

324
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,660
inscribed on talismans the rest of the

325
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,339
text is generally open and clearly

326
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,720
reveals the nature of the Cyber text

327
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,420
passages moreover the diagrams contained

328
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,519
in these books are clearly magical in

329
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,320
nature if you're trying to conceal the

330
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,940
purpose of the text you're definitely

331
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,279
not fooling anybody

332
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,500
so if using ciphers in your magical text

333
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,180
doesn't keep you from getting banned

334
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,560
what's the point of using it in the

335
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,839
first place in other words why go to the

336
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,820
trouble of secrecy if you aren't keeping

337
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,320
a secret

338
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,120
given this evidence one of sports the

339
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,260
entertain the idea that perhaps the

340
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,600
secret isn't the text itself

341
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,279
when creating a Talisman that stands

342
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,899
apart from the book it would be entirely

343
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,579
in ciphertext but this still doesn't

344
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,140
explain why implications would be in

345
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,000
Cypher and the talismans produced from a

346
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,440
book of magic would be just as clearly

347
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,300
magical in nature as the diagrams within

348
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,339
the book itself

349
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,800
if magical ciphers don't serve an obsec

350
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,260
related function then why use them we

351
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,820
could entertain the idea that they serve

352
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,440
a social function that they serve to

353
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,000
Mark someone as part of an in-group for

354
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,800
example and reinforce social cohesion

355
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,540
but that doesn't fit very well here

356
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,579
either in order to see that motivation

357
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:45,779
at work we have to look at the

358
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,339
Alchemists which we'll do in just a

359
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,180
moment

360
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,060
so what then Marcia alayade one of the

361
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,800
most influential Scholars of religion of

362
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,720
the 20th century proposed a dichotomy

363
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,459
between the sacred and the profane or

364
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,220
the mundane a non-sacred world he argued

365
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,600
that the primary attribute that makes

366
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,279
something sacred is that it's set apart

367
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,959
from everyday life in order to connect

368
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,700
to what he called a space outside of

369
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,279
space and a time outside of time and

370
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,959
that setting apart holds power in

371
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,940
pre-modern societies as well as for our

372
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,040
own you can see this tendency in action

373
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,200
today still in the use of archaic or

374
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,639
culturally foreign elements both in

375
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,680
Magic and in mainstream religion for

376
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,120
example the use of the and thou and

377
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,860
liturgical language and the continuing

378
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,540
use of the Latin Mass

379
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,459
an alphabet which is used only for the

380
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,019
purpose of the Sacred sets it apart from

381
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,420
Everyday Use the use of the cipher is

382
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,279
therefore itself a magical Act

383
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,000
I said that we'd look at the Alchemists

384
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,260
and I'm going to jump into that by

385
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,880
starting at what may seem like an odd

386
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,880
place namely Isaac Newton Newton was a

387
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,800
luminary of modern science he did

388
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,540
groundbreaking work in physics Optics

389
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,820
and Mathematics he was responsible for

390
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,320
calculus the law of universal

391
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,959
gravitation and classical mechanics

392
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,019
he was also a devout Alchemist

393
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,000
who obsessed over stories from ancient

394
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,620
Greek mythology looking for hidden

395
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,940
messages that he could use to create his

396
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,399
own chemical recipes

397
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,560
the way Newton engaged with Alchemy in

398
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,060
both language and perspective was

399
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,620
characteristic of the entirety of

400
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,360
European Alchemy dating back to at least

401
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,700
the 12th century while we might not see

402
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,380
the connection today when you go back

403
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,240
far enough early science and Magic

404
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,740
become difficult to distinguish from

405
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,880
each other

406
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,560
by name this time the two had begun to

407
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,360
diverge more completely but things were

408
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,860
still Messier in this regard than many

409
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,079
would like to admit alchemical thought

410
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,300
holds the belief that everything is a

411
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,399
cipher remember we can see this as well

412
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,220
in the doctrine of signatures and in the

413
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,000
priscosapiantia that we discussed when

414
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,399
talking about the steganographia this

415
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,200
belief pervaded the entire intellectual

416
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,420
tradition of esoteric magical and early

417
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,760
scientific thought it was also reflected

418
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,440
in the way Alchemists used language to

419
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,420
hide meanings and conceal the secrets of

420
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,380
their art

421
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,360
The Alchemist viewed all of creation as

422
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,920
a cipher to be decoded with meanings

423
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,500
hidden everywhere this experience of

424
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,720
reality as a riddle is reflected in the

425
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,940
language they use to talk about alchemy

426
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,560
the language and Alchemist is more

427
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,480
properly called on Argo in other words

428
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,060
an intentionally opaque jargon and

429
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,560
relied on certain locutions or

430
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,420
roundabout speech using this jargon to

431
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,240
conceal their true meanings

432
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,860
the biggest characteristic about

433
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,480
chemical discourse and the thing that

434
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,459
interested me here was its extensive use

435
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,740
of ciphers to communicate alchemical

436
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,300
jargon is often laid out in what are

437
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,100
called dekname which is a German term

438
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,680
meaning a cover name think of deknomin

439
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,540
as like word equivalents of cover files

440
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,300
for stego images in this case however a

441
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,740
lot of the time knowing the payload

442
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,180
still doesn't get you a lot closer to

443
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,860
understanding knowing that

444
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,380
hermaphroditical body is a deck Nama for

445
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,540
regulus Martis for example doesn't tell

446
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,339
you a lot you further have to understand

447
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,260
that regularly Smarties or the regulus

448
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,260
of Mars is itself jargon Mars refers to

449
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,060
iron the metal metal associated with

450
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,040
Mars and irregulus is a massive metal

451
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,959
formed beneath the slag and smelting and

452
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,540
reducing orders so regulus Marty so the

453
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,339
hermaphroditical body refers in effect

454
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:56,579
to a compound of the antimony

455
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:59,100
similarly alchemical Concepts were often

456
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,320
presented in images rather like mandalas

457
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,820
so if you've ever had to learn

458
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,920
subnetting for example take some comfort

459
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,019
it could be worse you could have just

460
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:08,880
been presented with diagrams of TCP

461
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,860
packets and layer 3 transport and told

462
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,480
to meditate on it until you figure it

463
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,820
out which isn't all that different from

464
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,320
how a lot of the secrets of alchemy were

465
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,360
transmitted

466
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,279
there were some attempts to de-obiscate

467
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,260
the terminology however the early

468
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,920
American Alchemist George Starkey

469
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,600
1628-1665 wrote a letter to Robert Boyle

470
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,420
in 1651 in which he included a key into

471
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,000
antimony which served as a decoder ring

472
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,680
for the alchemical language contained in

473
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,980
starkey's work marrow of alchemy

474
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,440
in order to understand why elephants use

475
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,000
this coded language in the first place

476
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,800
though it helps to consider that

477
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,360
Alchemists and magicians were the

478
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,820
hackers of their era they were inventors

479
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,759
makers tinkerers and yes subversives

480
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,500
working in their own ways to understand

481
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,540
what makes the universe tick and then

482
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,459
leveraging that unique understanding to

483
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,079
try and get privilege escalation on

484
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,399
their own existence

485
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,139
but mostly they did it for the love of

486
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,180
the puzzle and the thrill of discovery

487
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,919
sound familiar

488
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,839
just like hacking how come he was a

489
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,160
secret knowledge that wasn't actually

490
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,199
all that secret the knowledge was

491
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,059
available in books if you could read and

492
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,459
had access to them and the Argo was used

493
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,439
in a consistent if not necessarily

494
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,140
precise or straightforward manner for

495
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,699
example the green lion is pretty much

496
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,559
always going to refer to antimony but if

497
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,640
you try and count on your hands the

498
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,839
number of words that can be used for

499
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,339
Quicksilver you're going to need a few

500
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,140
extra hands

501
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,880
the books varied in quality and

502
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,679
sensationalism of course as one might

503
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,480
expect though there were a lot fewer

504
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,220
gratuitous stock images of Alchemists

505
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,299
and hoodies in the paintings in the

506
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,400
woodcuts of the day

507
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,720
but even though the knowledge wasn't

508
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,539
secret it was still sexy and the general

509
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,280
populace including certain heads of

510
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,900
government had a concept of alchemy that

511
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,059
bears about as much as as about about as

512
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,620
much resemblance to the actual pursuit

513
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,660
of the Philosopher's Stone as an episode

514
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,000
of CSI cyber does to real world digital

515
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,260
forensics

516
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,480
in other words turning lead into gold

517
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,919
was basically the early modern

518
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,100
equivalent of hacking the Gibson

519
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,539
and while the end goal of alchemy was to

520
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,160
produce the Philosopher's Stone which

521
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,419
was supposed to be able to turn base

522
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,280
Metals into gold that's really one of

523
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,140
its least interesting reputed properties

524
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,539
it was said to be able to cure all ills

525
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:14,820
bring dead plants back to life restore

526
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,160
Youth and Grant immortality and these

527
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,780
properties may even have been entirely

528
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,660
allegorical if we know that the pursuit

529
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,860
of the Philosopher's Stone was a

530
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,900
religious Pursuit and the healing of the

531
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,760
healing and immortality it may or may

532
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,320
not have been conceived of in a physical

533
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,200
sense in addition to a spiritual one the

534
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,760
spiritual hearing of the operator was

535
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,260
seen as inherently linked to the results

536
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,940
of their experiments and it's possible

537
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,740
the production of the actual stone was

538
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,020
merely a heuristic a physical sign to

539
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,100
say you've done the thing

540
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,320
congratulations

541
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,299
but either way whether the fruits of the

542
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,039
Alchemist is great work or material or

543
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,200
primarily spiritual in nature the

544
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,760
capabilities they brought were powerful

545
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,460
or at least the Alchemists thought so at

546
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,900
the very least they were precious to

547
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,240
those who sought them out alchemical

548
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,160
literature is full of stern admonitions

549
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,020
to keep the knowledge secret passing it

550
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,880
along to perhaps one worthy successor

551
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,620
and to prevent the sacred wisdom from

552
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,179
being tarnished by falling into the

553
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,340
hands of unworthy individuals

554
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,900
but most people didn't care about the

555
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,460
spiritual pursuit of the Alchemists they

556
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,720
just wanted to turn lead into gold

557
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,799
because they were all about the

558
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,720
Benjamins or the elizabeths as the case

559
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,340
may be

560
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,780
so you had people who reported their

561
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,640
heart into Alchemy as a passion and you

562
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,960
had the people who just wanted to use

563
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,120
the end results of their labor the

564
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,860
recipes they made to serve their own

565
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,720
Petty interests in other words they were

566
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,580
Renaissance script kitties the

567
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,020
Alchemists had disdain for these people

568
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,700
or just as hackers turned their noses up

569
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,740
as kids today

570
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,840
secrecy inherently creates an in-group

571
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,460
and an out group centered around those

572
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,020
who are in on the secret versus those

573
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,360
who aren't hacker culture formed its own

574
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,460
Argo which was designed to reinforce its

575
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,840
cultural values strengthen group

576
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,700
cohesion and create a barrier to entry

577
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,980
that one had to work in order to now

578
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,260
the willingness to do the work at least

579
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,299
in theory for the Love of the Game is

580
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:55,919
maybe the primary distinction between

581
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,780
hackers and script kitties and The

582
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,340
Alchemist Argo served all these same

583
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,919
functions because of this it was the

584
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,140
secrecy the act of keeping secrets

585
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,360
rather than the secrets themselves that

586
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,820
served the end goal Alchemist secrecy

587
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,140
strengthened and preserved a group

588
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,120
identity and safeguarded it against a

589
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,799
perceived threat which would dilute or

590
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,200
debase the group and its values it's

591
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,640
telling in this respect that few

592
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,740
alchemical texts use actual actual

593
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,360
crypto which would create a much more

594
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,160
substantive barrier to Discerning the

595
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,740
information the text concealed instead

596
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,080
they provide riddles they simultaneously

597
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,940
invited those who were in on the secret

598
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,919
excluded those who weren't willing to

599
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,440
work to uncover it in this respect

600
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,059
whereas using a homophonic or

601
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,280
polyalphabetic Cipher to safeguard one's

602
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,720
Secrets was the early modern equivalent

603
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,360
of encrypting it with the pgp key

604
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,679
alchemical Argo was more like a crypto

605
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,720
challenge it presented the appearance of

606
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,460
being impenetrable but at the end of the

607
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,080
day the riddle like the crypto challenge

608
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,080
is designed to be solved

609
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,820
now there are a few exceptions to that

610
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,440
rule that we have out in the sport where

611
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,059
we can see a different mode in play than

612
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,520
the social one for example while Robert

613
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,200
Boyle was an advocate of Greater

614
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,700
openness in alchemy and attempted to

615
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,320
break down some of the cultural barriers

616
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,059
that were presented by the Reliance upon

617
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,580
Argo he himself used mono-alphabetic

618
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,500
ciphers along with name substitution and

619
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,240
code words to safeguard his own private

620
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,940
documents in this case however he had an

621
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,039
entirely different threat model Boyle

622
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,299
was protecting himself against an

623
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,980
evil-made attack or at least an attack

624
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,380
by his literate and presumably overly

625
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,940
inquisitive assistance who he didn't

626
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,380
wish to be pretty to the contents of his

627
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,179
nose

628
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:28,799
so far we talked about substitution

629
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,240
ciphers that weren't used to hide

630
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,400
anything an alchemist whose cryptic

631
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,539
writing was more about keeping their

632
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,039
knowledge than actually keeping it

633
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,200
secret we're talking about magicians and

634
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,580
others who had a tenuous relationship

635
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,440
with the authorities people who did

636
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,659
unquestionably have secrets to hide so

637
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,220
where's the juicy crypto in all this

638
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,640
good news I've saved the best for last

639
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,460
it's the middle of the 1700s there's a

640
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,860
conspiracy afoot a secret society

641
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,020
working in the shadows a group of

642
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,299
subversives plotting a Revolt a

643
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,820
nation-state threat model and the cipher

644
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,320
that wasn't broken until more than two

645
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,179
and a half centuries later

646
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:05,159
all hiding behind the facade of a

647
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,659
professional organization of mild

648
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,100
mannered ophthalmologists

649
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,620
okay

650
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,539
to start innocently enough the great

651
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:17,460
Enlightenment Society of oculus was

652
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,340
founded around 1745 in Germany by count

653
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,159
Friedrich August von feldheim it claimed

654
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:24,720
to be a professional Society of eye

655
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,400
doctors which admitted both men and

656
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,020
women and performed groundbreaking work

657
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,340
in the field of eye surgeries and

658
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,559
cataract removals they also did their

659
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,059
best to maintain the reputation of the

660
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,679
emerging profession by keeping out the

661
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,480
charlatans who could cause someone to

662
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,820
lose their eyesight forever but things

663
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,380
began to seem Stranger Than first

664
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,059
expected when the society's founder died

665
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:45,299
30 years later in 1775. he had locked

666
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,860
away all of his materials pertaining to

667
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,780
the Oculus and a trunk

668
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,880
in his will he ordered his son to keep

669
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,740
the trunk locked with the seals unbroken

670
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,360
until the local duke or one of his

671
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,520
descendants said otherwise when the

672
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,799
trunk was finally opened in 1918 almost

673
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,780
150 years later things got even more

674
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,039
puzzling

675
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:04,860
alongside the Oculus seal aprons and

676
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,380
amulets worn by Society members a

677
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,000
painstakingly detailed anatomical

678
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,919
anatomical model of the eye and other

679
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,340
artifacts there was a strange manuscript

680
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,659
handwritten on watermarked paper with a

681
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:17,700
golden green binding the manuscript was

682
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,760
105 pages long and written entirely in

683
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,039
cyber the only plain text to be found

684
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,900
was an owner's mark on the first page

685
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,880
and an abbreviated signature next to a

686
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,400
note reading copy LS3 on the last page

687
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,559
which gave the copy outside for its name

688
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,679
everything in between was a mystery

689
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,740
it wasn't until 2011 that the cipher was

690
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,179
finally decoded by an international

691
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:40,740
group of researchers using

692
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,120
computer-assisted cryptanalysis

693
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,220
techniques the code itself was a

694
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,900
homophonic Cipher meaning that multiple

695
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,580
ciphertext characters were used for

696
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,799
certain plain text characters it also

697
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,780
used nomenclares where individual cycle

698
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,700
text characters that represented entire

699
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,380
Words which occurred frequently in the

700
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,360
text it refers to here as logon

701
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,980
logograms

702
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,440
the cipher used a total of 97 different

703
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,120
symbols taken from Roman and Greek

704
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,400
alphabets diacritical marks grammatical

705
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,500
characters planetary symbols and a

706
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,400
number of symbols which didn't

707
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,380
correspond to any known language

708
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,480
at the time it was created this type of

709
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,000
encryption was state-of-the-art

710
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,260
homophonic nomenclature ciphers were

711
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,240
used by Regents diplomats and Generals

712
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,820
to guard their state secrets unlike the

713
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,620
monoalphabetic ciphers used in magical

714
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,480
texts or alchemical jargon used to

715
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,220
separate the old hackers from the old

716
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,260
script kitties this Cipher was

717
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,760
definitely intended to hide something

718
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,580
and to hide it well against a determined

719
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,460
and capable adversary but what Secrets

720
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,140
would a group of eye doctors need to

721
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,600
protect with a military-grade cipher who

722
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,220
are they protecting these secrets from

723
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,200
and why was it so important that the

724
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,880
Trump containing the manuscript remain

725
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,100
locked and sealed clearly there was more

726
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,559
to the Oculus Society than meets the eye

727
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,159
the decipher text was divided in three

728
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,320
parts the first part represented the

729
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,880
secret counterpart of the Oculus

730
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,039
societies published bylaws detailing the

731
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,960
origin of the society its initiation

732
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,000
rituals and instructions for recognizing

733
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,059
and identifying oneself to other members

734
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:10,260
instructions that seem more at home in a

735
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,179
Cold War era spy movie than in a

736
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,620
fraternal organization

737
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,419
it also laid out the teachings of the

738
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,039
Oculus society that were concealed from

739
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,419
the public eye

740
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,220
the deciphered text is politically

741
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,500
subversive calling for a general revolt

742
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,419
against a tyrannical government which

743
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:25,860
gives insight into what the threat model

744
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,539
was and who the society was trying to

745
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:30,059
hide its secrets from it gives highly

746
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,740
detailed information on the rituals and

747
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,900
symbolism of Freemasonry to a degree

748
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,400
that wouldn't be widely known until much

749
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,799
later it's also been hypothesized that

750
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,860
the Oculus were spying on the Freemasons

751
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,600
it's worth noting that membership in a

752
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,279
Freemasonry was forbidden by the

753
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:46,260
Catholic church around a decade prior to

754
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,059
the founding of the Oculus and

755
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,799
Freemasonry was criticized at the time

756
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,539
for poor betting of membership and then

757
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,940
inability to keep secrets it appears

758
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,740
that the Oculus were founded to carry on

759
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,059
the secrets and traditions of

760
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,220
Freemasonry under a different name with

761
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,260
a different craft with a much greater

762
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,299
emphasis on selectivity in keeping

763
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,640
secrets hidden and possibly with a more

764
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,640
politically subversive motive the role

765
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,380
of Freemasons

766
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,240
oh wow party time

767
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,620
all right

768
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,900
well let's give this a second otherwise

769
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,520
I'll just keep going

770
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,919
okay Live Theater it's always exciting

771
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,340
isn't it

772
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,720
here so yeah the role of Freemasons in

773
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,980
the near the American and French

774
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,200
revolutions is really well documented

775
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,720
the egalitarian ethos of Freemasonry

776
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,100
mesh seamlessly with the Liberty

777
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,380
equality fraternity revolutionary ethos

778
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,120
and so once again we see the

779
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,620
relationship between the form of the

780
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,600
cryptography being used and the secrets

781
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,799
it contains

782
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,600
earlier in this presentation we looked

783
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,159
at ciphers from magical texts that were

784
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:54,539
used primarily by scattered

785
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:56,640
practitioners and the language used by a

786
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,500
loose and geographically diverse culture

787
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,299
of Alchemists to shore up their societal

788
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:01,919
walls and exclude those they saw as

789
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,320
Unworthy of their knowledge in this case

790
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,940
a style of Cipher that was more

791
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,320
frequently used to conceal government

792
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,299
secrets was used by a tight-knit group

793
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,460
of networked radicals who apparently

794
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,080
sought to overthrow those governments

795
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,820
and to avoid the mistakes of shoddy

796
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,260
offseck they saw in mainstream

797
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,360
Freemasonry while preserving its Secrets

798
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,360
at its subversive goals

799
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,919
given that the period we've covered

800
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:24,539
zeldom or see as much attention in

801
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,039
discussions of cryptography's History

802
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,779
these stories all certainly illustrate

803
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,279
how much depth and richness gets

804
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,320
overlooked as a result the medieval and

805
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,760
early modern periods were times with

806
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,559
huge cultural change about people both

807
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,200
politically and intellectually

808
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,640
cryptography grew up in this chaotic sea

809
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,320
bit of culture just as much as many of

810
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,000
the other early scientists did and

811
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,919
probably evolved during this time faster

812
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,600
than any other period until the dawn of

813
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,059
the 20th century if we can resist the

814
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:49,500
urge to skip Straight From The Classical

815
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,480
period to the modern era as we talk

816
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,880
about historical cryptography we have so

817
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,340
many more stories we can tell I hope you

818
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,419
found some of these stories as

819
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,159
interesting as I have and going forward

820
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,900
I hope you'll pick up the torch and tell

821
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,120
some of these stories with me

822
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,080
any questions

823
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,220
all right well thank you very much

824
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:43,279
right here
