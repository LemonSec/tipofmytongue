[Music]

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,700
thank you

3
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:29,238
[Music]

4
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,218
all right

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,460
foreign

6
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,700
ladies gentlemen and fine folks who

7
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,640
identify as neither nice to see you all

8
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,680
it's a wonderful beautiful other Cypher

9
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,740
Cod I uh actually gave one of my very

10
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,380
very early talks at Cypher con one and

11
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,140
it was not this impressively organized

12
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,580
and engineered so this is pretty

13
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,140
exciting for me

14
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,939
there's still some people filtering in

15
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,020
Hello friends

16
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,159
so uh if we

17
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,299
could think I'd met no

18
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,240
but there's a couple new faces here my

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,579
name is Leslie Carhart and what do I do

20
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,619
for a living I

21
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,740
I do incident response for a very unique

22
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,439
systems uh industrial control systems to

23
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,320
be specific so when something like a

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,119
power plant gets hacked

25
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,720
or a water treatment plant or

26
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,820
manufacturing even trains my team is

27
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,320
some of the few folks in the world who

28
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,360
go out and try to figure out what

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,740
happened and try to keep it from

30
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,899
happening again in the future I work for

31
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,880
a company called dragos and that's all

32
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,098
we do is industrial stuff

33
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,959
and I've been doing into the response

34
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,180
for a pretty long time now

35
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,400
um I've been in it for over 20 years now

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,200
I've been in ir and differ for well like

37
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,900
12 13 years

38
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,959
um and I speak about this stuff a lot I

39
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,720
blog about it and I tweet and Tick-Tock

40
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,879
and everything prolifically about cyber

41
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,220
security sorry about that

42
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,840
um I retired from the United States Air

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,660
Force Reserves in December so after 21

44
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,739
years

45
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,080
and in my free time I teach small people

46
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,500
to hit things in martial arts

47
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,780
so what are we going to talk about uh we

48
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,040
just had a really really interesting

49
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,260
keynote on a completely different

50
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,060
technical topic

51
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,500
um and I just want to take us back to

52
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,239
the beginning and and talk a little bit

53
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,580
about jobs in cyber security because

54
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,040
it's something I get asked about a lot I

55
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,360
get asked about

56
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,319
um

57
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,080
you know different things that people

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,000
could do in cyber security and a lot of

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,040
times young people come up to me and

60
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,000
they're like

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,560
well they want to get into cyber

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,420
security and then I ask them well what

63
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,940
do you want to do and they're like I I

64
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,440
don't know what should I do

65
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,900
and that's really a complicated topic I

66
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,700
ended up writing a very long Vlog series

67
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,379
about this it's been passed around the

68
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,659
internet for a while and um

69
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,580
you know in the beginning you know we

70
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,140
try to figure out whether people want to

71
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,420
go the more offense to the the red team

72
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,819
route or the more defense The Blue Team

73
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:33,959
route

74
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,580
and they're both very very valid and

75
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,739
they're both interesting careers but the

76
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,080
bottom line is there is so much going on

77
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,000
in cyber security that it's it's

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,760
difficult to learn everything in one

79
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,299
Niche right and um to learn two niches

80
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,480
is a lot and you just can't learn at all

81
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,120
and uh it's good to Shadow other career

82
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,680
fields and cyber security and learn a

83
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,940
little bit about them we talk about like

84
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,739
purple teaming

85
00:03:58,739 --> 00:03:59,340
um

86
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,680
and and that's an on some concept I'll

87
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,720
talk a little bit about later but in the

88
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,580
end you can only fit so much in your

89
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,560
brain so you kind of have to focus in

90
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,879
cyber security and uh people just they

91
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,379
aren't sure where they want to go so

92
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,000
sometimes they hop around a little bit

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,680
sometimes they try to start in a job

94
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,418
that gives them exposure to a lot of

95
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:19,798
different things

96
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,560
but today I want to talk to you about

97
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,199
selecting a role and which one might be

98
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,500
interesting for you specifically

99
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,600
um and how do we do that right now well

100
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,979
you might come up to a person like me

101
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,960
and be like what job should I get and

102
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,540
I'm like I don't know I don't know you

103
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,000
um what do you want to do

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,919
um so we usually make those decisions

105
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,660
based on well first of all what we think

106
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,300
is cool so maybe what we see on TV or at

107
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,220
conference talks or we hear about in our

108
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,320
classes you know there's there's these

109
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,780
like the prototypical hackers out there

110
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,979
available so I'm sorry about that but

111
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:00,000
you know um we see this this idealized

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,100
image of these various roles in cyber

113
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,240
security especially things like

114
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,580
conducting like yeah you're breaking

115
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,020
into stuff you're hacking things it's

116
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,060
really really cool

117
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,919
um and you also hear about things that

118
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,360
are talked about in your circle so maybe

119
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,979
you're at Cypher con today and you go to

120
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,600
a talk and you hear about something that

121
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,040
sounds really neat and you're like oh I

122
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,780
want to do that when I grow up and that

123
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,220
happens to me all the time I want to be

124
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,160
like 14 more things when I grow up

125
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,620
um and you see you see a view of things

126
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,960
from the outside so you see kind of a

127
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,320
view of how you perceive things from a

128
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,220
limited image okay and uh it really

129
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,320
depends a lot on what you personally are

130
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,780
exposed to once you end up deciding to

131
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,880
do and that can be based on kind of a

132
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,160
False Image right because we see these

133
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,320
idealized temporary images of these

134
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,380
various niches in cyber security

135
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,300
so let's talk a little bit about you all

136
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,520
so I want you to think about yourselves

137
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,440
for a moment I want you to do a lot of

138
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,720
introspection during this talk but let's

139
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,160
let's think about

140
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,800
um ways that we kind of characterize

141
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,300
ourselves so

142
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,580
if you work for a large company you will

143
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,759
oftentimes run into team Dynamic models

144
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,020
so you go and you take your little

145
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,880
personality test maybe tells you what

146
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,039
color you are or something or you know

147
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,620
what set of letters or things that you

148
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,500
you are based on their their exam and

149
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,840
hey these these models they they try to

150
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,460
put people in boxes with which never

151
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,860
really works um like we talk about uh

152
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,419
Myers-Briggs and stuff and we say it's

153
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,539
like um Fair analogy for HR things like

154
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:32,580
that it's it's just kind of artificial

155
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,199
and you really can't put people into a

156
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,000
box like that

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,360
um however models that talk about

158
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,240
various aspects of personality can be

159
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,100
useful to understand things about

160
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,419
yourself and the people that you work

161
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,880
with but you're a tool they are not a

162
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,979
magical thing that's going to assign

163
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,900
your your Sorting Hat assignment to

164
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,460
something like that's that's not what's

165
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,020
going to happen there you'll get some

166
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,600
ideas about how you might differ from

167
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,580
other people who are doing a similar job

168
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,979
or a different job and so we're gonna

169
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:03,360
we're gonna use some of these models

170
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,919
today and I don't want you to get hung

171
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,020
up on them they're all everything's a

172
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,699
spectrum in the world people are

173
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,460
complicated people change over time if

174
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,100
your personality tests today

175
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,680
um in in a year you might come back and

176
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,539
characterize completely differently by

177
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,280
the same test because we change our

178
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,800
lives change we change

179
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,319
um and so so we really can't be put into

180
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,020
a box like that but

181
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,020
um as I said to talk about some of these

182
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,479
roles and who might like them and who

183
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,759
might not like them I'm going to use

184
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,759
some of these as a tool so so let's

185
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,340
start at a high level stuff to consider

186
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,419
about yourself

187
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,940
so introspection time think about this

188
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,000
for a moment so your attention span

189
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
this is an important factor right some

190
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,660
of these jobs I'm going to talk about

191
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,940
today I'm going to talk about things

192
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,240
that that are exciting to certain

193
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,740
personality types and I'm going to talk

194
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,660
about things that are often considered

195
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,380
negatives so the downsides of the jobs

196
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,240
um now some people might disagree with

197
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,280
me on that because I have a personality

198
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,860
of my own I ended up in a specific niche

199
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,419
of cyber security

200
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,340
and thankfully there are people who are

201
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,380
very very different from me who think

202
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,940
some of the stuff I find very very

203
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,460
boring is pretty exciting

204
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,759
that said there are always mundane parts

205
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,940
of every cyber security role okay

206
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,160
everyone has stuff that we rarely see in

207
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,560
talks because even the people who really

208
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,559
love their work agree that that part is

209
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,020
kind of dull and frustrating and time

210
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,599
consuming and boring it's the nature of

211
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,059
almost every job in cyber security and

212
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,559
we're going to talk about a whole bunch

213
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,000
of them

214
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,920
um so your attention span how long can

215
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,680
you focus on a single thing

216
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,620
and um you know is that a short period

217
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,839
of time or can you focus on one task for

218
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,180
days at a time and be really happy

219
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,060
and then there's introversion versus

220
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,100
extroversion and all the area in between

221
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,440
the two how much do you like dealing

222
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,440
with humans all right so some of you are

223
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,360
really outgoing and really like talking

224
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,760
to people and meeting people and some of

225
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,680
you really would like to be a little bit

226
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,480
more isolated in your work

227
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,100
balance is between the two there's

228
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,420
people who like to go out and meet

229
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,880
people and then need time to recharge so

230
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,080
they're they're somewhere on the

231
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,880
introvert site a side of things but

232
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,680
they're a little bit further towards

233
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,720
extrovert so that can really play into

234
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,339
where you're going to be happy as a job

235
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:30,500
as well

236
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,880
analytical versus creative thinkers

237
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,800
again it's a spectrum you can be a

238
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,480
little bit of both

239
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,940
um but again something to consider

240
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,680
your patience

241
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,380
do you get frustrated easily how about

242
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,720
with people how about with people you're

243
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,740
teaching

244
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,779
how about with things that are not

245
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,660
concrete I run into this a lot in cyber

246
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,279
security people who get tremendously

247
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,959
frustrated because the thing they're

248
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,839
doing in cyber security doesn't have a

249
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,120
concrete conclusion or concrete finding

250
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,820
the answer is fuzzy and some people

251
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,060
really can't take that okay

252
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,160
empathy and emotional intelligence for

253
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,560
both nefarious and good reasons we'll

254
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,180
talk about some of these roles where

255
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,880
that's a really important thing

256
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,100
and it's a useful skill

257
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,620
and it can also be a negative in in some

258
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,839
of these cases as well willingness to

259
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,240
travel and work non-standard hours that

260
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,279
can be considered a negative in a lot of

261
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,320
jobs if you're on the road all the time

262
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,399
in them

263
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,380
you're writing and presenting skills

264
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,839
we'll talk about these a lot it's not

265
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,100
something that makes a lot of the

266
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,140
YouTube Defcon talks

267
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,060
it's just not something that we bring up

268
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,000
a whole bunch however it is a really

269
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,100
huge element of a lot of the job roles

270
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,800
we'll we'll talk about today okay

271
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,440
and finally your reaction to stressful

272
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,839
situations do you like being being up in

273
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,399
front of a big audience and giving a

274
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,440
talk or is that like your idea of a

275
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,360
nightmare I see some of you cringing

276
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,380
right now

277
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,480
I think this is fun I see all my friends

278
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,100
they've got sparkly Badges and things

279
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,079
but some people don't think that's cool

280
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,560
so let's talk about a few of these so-so

281
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,240
models that we can use to to talk about

282
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,560
people so the first one I'm going to

283
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,200
introduce you to is curtin's adapter

284
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,380
innovator model so this model is it

285
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,860
assumes the following it it hypothesizes

286
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,660
the following that everybody ends up on

287
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,300
a spectrum between adapters and

288
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,620
innovators

289
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,959
see your adapters or people who like to

290
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,079
take something that's exists already and

291
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,120
change it to do something new so this is

292
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,860
kind of a hacker mentality sometimes

293
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,899
like find something that does one thing

294
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,300
and make it better or change it to do

295
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,220
something different so that's pretty

296
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,560
cool right but on the other side of this

297
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,240
there's innovators and the innovators

298
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,800
are people who like to kind of throw

299
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,660
things out burn them down and start from

300
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,560
scratch

301
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,360
and I bet if you think about this for a

302
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,459
moment if you work on a team in school

303
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,140
or at work

304
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,180
you run into situations where those two

305
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,980
things butt heads it oftentimes happens

306
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,380
between like technical people creative

307
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,839
people and sales people

308
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,959
or Executives Finance people this is

309
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,579
something that people butt heads on a

310
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,680
lot is whether to fix something that

311
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,540
exists or burn it down and start over

312
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,399
and again this is a spectrum you can be

313
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,540
in the middle of it you can be

314
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,700
comfortable with both that's fine but

315
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,040
that can cause conflicts individually

316
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,899
and as teams

317
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,120
learning styles so we generally talk

318
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,640
about three types of Learners okay and

319
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,040
people usually fall into two one or two

320
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,260
of those categories so first of all

321
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,000
there's visual Learners they like to see

322
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,560
there's they're staring at the screen

323
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,560
right now and they they like to look at

324
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,300
the PowerPoint they like to learn by

325
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,579
looking at things

326
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,560
um auditory Learners they are the ones

327
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,120
who are listening to my words right now

328
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,860
thank you very much auditory Learners I

329
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,839
appreciate that

330
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,000
um and uh that's how they like to learn

331
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,040
they like to listen to podcasts

332
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,200
that's that's useful to them uh they can

333
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,120
listen to like on-demand training and

334
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,380
things like that and really learn from

335
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,480
it finally there's kinesthetic Learners

336
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,700
and I'm I'm I fall into this category

337
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,200
the people who like to do things to

338
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,139
learn them so to learn a new task they

339
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,779
want to Hands-On keyboard do the task

340
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,880
and that's how they learn things that's

341
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,380
how things stick maybe they have to take

342
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,079
notes write things down during a lecture

343
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,480
to actually memorize it so people

344
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,639
usually fall into one or two of those

345
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,560
categories and don't like the third but

346
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,800
that's not everybody

347
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,240
now let's get on to William Marston

348
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,880
Marston created one of the early team

349
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,600
Dynamic models for personalities okay he

350
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,519
also happened to create a comic I like

351
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,040
very much Wonder Woman he had a varied

352
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,740
and obscure career

353
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,139
um and uh it goes like this there's

354
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:45,120
there's different categories elements

355
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,600
that we divide people into and it ends

356
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,459
up that we end up somewhere on this

357
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,980
cervical circular

358
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,339
um cyclical uh map of personality traits

359
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:57,959
and types

360
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,820
so let's talk about them really quickly

361
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,860
and I want you to think about where you

362
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,660
might fall in here again this is not

363
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,700
scientific it's not a be all end-all it

364
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,620
might change tomorrow but so we have the

365
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,660
Challenger so the Challenger is very

366
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,519
competitive they are high expectation

367
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,800
person they're a good leader they like

368
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,660
to ask critical questions they like to

369
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,180
get into The Fray and lead the situation

370
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,760
very type a kind of person

371
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,959
you have the winner

372
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,180
Winner Takes things as winning and

373
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,519
losing based on a big picture they like

374
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,560
to make big decisions they like to

375
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,139
invest in the stock market they like to

376
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,820
you know see whether something is

377
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,399
successful or fails they can miss small

378
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,860
details they're not very detail-oriented

379
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,720
in the end what matters to them is did

380
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,240
it work or did it not work the Seeker

381
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,220
their strong leader they're assertive

382
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,019
they're fast-paced and they push

383
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,060
boundaries these are like your startup

384
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,040
CEOs the people who really want to just

385
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,680
launch into things and and uh lead a

386
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,500
project to to successful completion

387
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,420
and there's a risk taker they're really

388
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,579
a gambler an adventurer they like

389
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,199
adrenaline

390
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,779
um they're oftentimes bored in

391
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,399
situations if things are not high

392
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,399
pressure and moving fast and exciting

393
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,000
um

394
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,760
they do have the ability to be very

395
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,560
overconfident about themselves and

396
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,560
sometimes they make bad risk decisions

397
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,899
the enthusiasts so they're extroverted

398
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,459
they're really friendly they're creative

399
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,320
they're artistic they're a great

400
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,600
networker but they're oftentimes not a

401
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,040
really good listener

402
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,260
um so they're your social butterfly in a

403
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,060
group who likes to associate with people

404
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,160
but they're mostly concerned about

405
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,560
number one you know the type okay

406
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,660
the buddy so the Buddy tries to make

407
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,399
everybody happy they're that person who

408
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,320
is really uncomfortable letting somebody

409
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,320
down or telling somebody no or firing

410
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,639
somebody because they want to make

411
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,120
everybody happy all the time

412
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,880
okay the other six the collaborator the

413
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,500
collaborator is the person who walks

414
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,240
into an angry team and tries to get

415
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,220
everybody to get along

416
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,440
so when the team is arguing they act

417
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,660
they act as the marriage counselor

418
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,639
they're the person who

419
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,380
stops the argument and makes people

420
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,360
compromise and and tries to play

421
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,760
Diplomat in business situations they're

422
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,940
very supportive and very outgoing

423
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,339
the Peacekeeper they defuse negative

424
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,079
systems but they're very very calm

425
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,000
they're diplomatic and they're very risk

426
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,260
adverse so conflict to them is a risk

427
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,660
the technician is more introverted so

428
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,279
they're analytical they're highly

429
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,800
rational they're sometimes inflexible

430
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,360
they they're very thorough about

431
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,339
processes and they're very calm so

432
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,199
they're mathematicians things like that

433
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,000
Engineers

434
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,519
um they like to work on calm organized

435
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,079
things

436
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,880
the bedrock's a person who just does

437
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,860
whatever needs to be done on a team you

438
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,300
know whatever needs to get done they

439
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,220
stay in the in the background they don't

440
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,199
get noticed and when things are broken

441
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,959
they fix them and they can be a little

442
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,699
bit too introverted and humble they

443
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,139
don't get credit for a lot of the

444
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,880
projects they do

445
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,160
and there's the analyst they are highly

446
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,860
logical and detail-oriented another like

447
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,140
scientist or mathematician type role

448
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,359
they're a perfectionist and they're very

449
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,880
very focused on single tasks so they can

450
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,799
focus on something for a long time like

451
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,059
a project

452
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,740
and finally we have the perfectionist

453
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,079
the perfectionist is the person that is

454
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,559
me

455
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,260
the other person they can be blunt they

456
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,760
could they question everything when they

457
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,380
come into a project as part of a team

458
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,419
they're like hey this isn't going to

459
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,280
work I can see how this is going to fail

460
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,780
here's how this is going to fail they're

461
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,160
usually the person who's seen as kind of

462
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,140
negative because they take everything

463
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,240
apart and say what's going to break

464
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,520
so again these are just

465
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,559
some ways to look at your personality

466
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,780
maybe you grabbed onto one of these or

467
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,280
two of these and you said that's kind of

468
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,140
my personality I'm just using them as a

469
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,880
tool here I'm not like a True Believer

470
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,919
in any of these models again you can't

471
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,660
put human beings in a box but I'm going

472
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,520
to talk about some cyber security rules

473
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,240
now

474
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,860
I'm going to talk about some things you

475
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,660
might be interested in doing in the

476
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,799
future right and various niches that you

477
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,720
can get into as a cyber security person

478
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,120
both on the blue team and the red team

479
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,980
and to do that

480
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,960
I'm going to use these personality

481
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,960
models and learning styles these these

482
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,700
different personality traits we talked

483
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,440
about to talk about where you might be

484
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,480
happy or unhappy because I'm not going

485
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,160
to just talk about what's really cool in

486
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,900
a job you can go on YouTube and watch a

487
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,760
hundred talks about why pen testic is

488
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,740
neat why you want to break into

489
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,840
buildings and rob banks oh my God you'll

490
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,820
go watch Johnny Christmas's talks holy

491
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,100
cow I mean like yeah it's really really

492
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,799
cool but there is 70 of that work you're

493
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,600
not seeing in the YouTube talks for the

494
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,940
most part and it's the part that people

495
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,559
even people who really love the work

496
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,720
might consider boring and that's an

497
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,520
important aspect to consider when you're

498
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,220
deciding what job to take right what is

499
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,160
the the other 70 of the iceberg that I

500
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,600
don't see in these talks all the time

501
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,100
that people aren't plugging to me that

502
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,780
my teachers aren't trying to sell me an

503
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,820
expensive degree program on

504
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,679
let's talk about them okay

505
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,539
so first of all it's red team blue team

506
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,880
purple thing okay

507
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,000
everybody in cyber security hopefully

508
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,740
trying to improve the defensive

509
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,539
organizations they just do it in

510
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,580
different ways all these niches I'm

511
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,440
going to talk about they're all super

512
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,260
important and they all have an impact on

513
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,299
the defense of an organization and even

514
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,580
if you are a pen test or a red team or

515
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,380
breaking into things or you're doing

516
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,260
exploit or vulnerability research your

517
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,360
end goal should be making people more

518
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,419
secure okay so these divisions they're

519
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,460
kind of in the the realm of work that

520
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,720
you'll be in but in the end everybody

521
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,640
has the same end goal and that's to keep

522
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,280
bad people criminals out of net networks

523
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,220
and keep people's information safe right

524
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,740
so the red team they typically do this

525
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,500
more offensively this is your pen

526
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,960
testers your red teamers your exploit

527
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,720
researchers Etc and they are doing

528
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,020
things more like emulating the criminals

529
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,240
to prevent the criminals from actually

530
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,000
being successful so let's go out and see

531
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,980
how the criminals are doing things and

532
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,120
see how it would work in this

533
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,740
environment so that we can catch it

534
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,900
before it actually happens

535
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,140
the blue team is the Defenders so

536
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,000
they're they're kind of they're doing

537
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,260
the monitoring and the forensics and the

538
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,720
you know system configuration to try to

539
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,100
defend the network

540
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,200
they're all in the end contributing to

541
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,480
the defense of the organization and

542
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,039
that's all really really important they

543
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,240
all have the same goal and they should

544
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,340
all be working together but they're kind

545
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,720
of two different tracks for getting into

546
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,280
cyber security

547
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,080
now let's talk about this purple team

548
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,120
elephant in the room

549
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,799
purple team everybody should have

550
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,780
exposure to both you know you should if

551
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,220
you're a blue team or a dedicated

552
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,679
lifelong blue teamer you should Shadow

553
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,480
some of cement testers sometime and see

554
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,640
how they work you'll learn a lot I

555
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,380
certainly have I've learned a ton from

556
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,880
this it's awesome

557
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,160
and same with the red team you're going

558
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,600
to learn a lot about breaking into

559
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,640
things to see where Defenders screw up

560
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,000
you know it's going to help you so yeah

561
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,120
is an important concept and we should be

562
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,919
working together because we are one team

563
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,059
one fight

564
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,760
however to learn both of those things in

565
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,880
great detail is incredibly difficult nay

566
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,740
impossible

567
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,280
um you really can't again focus on more

568
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,980
than one niche in in huge detail in

569
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,260
great detail there's just too much

570
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,600
information our field is changing all

571
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,640
the time each of our niches is changing

572
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,159
all the time so in the end after we get

573
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,440
out of generalist roles you kind of have

574
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,340
to focus a little bit

575
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,200
um and just some example roles for the

576
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,820
two and again they are working together

577
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,860
they should be doing shadowing and

578
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,080
overlapping but you know your blue team

579
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,120
is kind of you started out as maybe a

580
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,559
sock analyst that's kind of your

581
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,900
entry-level defensive role and you may

582
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,460
you may become something like an

583
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,620
incident responder or a malware reverser

584
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,960
or a security architect you might even

585
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,640
get into threat intelligence if that's

586
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,140
something that interests you

587
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,940
and on your red team side you might

588
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,580
become a junior pen tester as an

589
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,320
entry-level role

590
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,179
um and then move into something like

591
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:09,840
exploit research or red teaming etc etc

592
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,100
so

593
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,020
there's multiple paths into these but

594
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,940
they kind of are their own skill trees

595
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,340
or career trees something to think about

596
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,000
as we continue

597
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,159
my job is digital forensics and incident

598
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,380
response so let's talk about what I do

599
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,780
so I'm a detective when somebody gets

600
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,919
hacked into

601
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:31,020
I'm the one who goes out and tries to

602
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,220
figure out

603
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,720
forensically

604
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,640
timeline and a narrative of the

605
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,460
intrusion so what's the story of how

606
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,919
somebody got in and what they did

607
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:42,840
so really cool right that's that's it's

608
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,700
cool work it's interesting it's engaging

609
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,260
you're trying to catch the adversary

610
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,480
find out what they did and build this

611
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,580
granular detailed timeline and story

612
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,860
about how they got in and what they did

613
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,780
and what impact that has on the

614
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,159
environment

615
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,220
and my sales pitch here is yeah it's

616
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,840
cool you're a detective you are

617
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,320
performing an investigation from zero to

618
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,640
understanding a full detailed picture

619
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,220
that the adversary tried to hide of how

620
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,620
the network was intruded into and what

621
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,659
happened to the devices

622
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,940
so you are you are doing an

623
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,220
investigation in CSI stuff it's pretty

624
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,059
neat

625
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,460
now what's the downside of my job all

626
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,720
right

627
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,659
this is Crisis management work it's

628
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,280
incredibly stressful for the person

629
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,440
calling me in and therefore it's

630
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,960
incredibly stressful for me you usually

631
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,820
I'm walking into these situations where

632
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,620
people are sweating bullets and the

633
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,360
executives are screaming

634
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,039
everybody's having their worst day ever

635
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,440
and what what do people do when they're

636
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,179
already stressed out well they lash out

637
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,159
at you they're angry they swear at you

638
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,380
they don't want to cooperate with you

639
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,480
they question everything you do they

640
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,820
don't trust anybody they're they're in a

641
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,559
bad emotional state when I'm dealing

642
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,000
with them already I don't get to see

643
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,440
them on their best day I see them on

644
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,299
their worst day

645
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:58,740
um that also means that there's a ton of

646
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,360
sudden travel

647
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,640
um my job can mean having a bag by the

648
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,799
door and being gone on an airplane with

649
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,840
a few hours notice at any given time

650
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,900
even over the holidays

651
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,580
um there's a lot of hurry up and wait

652
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,880
too we I talk about crises but crises

653
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,860
don't necessarily mean I'm doing things

654
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,900
constantly it can mean I have to be in a

655
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,000
plane right away but then I have to sit

656
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,679
there for eight hours because the person

657
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,360
who's who needs to let me into the

658
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,799
building isn't there

659
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,720
and I could just sit there on my laptop

660
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,520
and do nothing and just wait and

661
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,900
everybody's panicking and everybody's

662
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,700
screaming and there's nothing I can do

663
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,440
for eight hours or maybe I have to wait

664
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,320
for evidence to transfer or processor

665
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,960
etc for for several hours so there's a

666
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,580
lot of hurry up and wait in the job and

667
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,320
that can be incredibly stressful when

668
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,940
you're already in a stressful crisis

669
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,740
situation so you have to be able to

670
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,260
manage that level of stress and also

671
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,220
being patient when you can't do anything

672
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,600
sometimes you don't get a satisfying

673
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,940
answer in my job either you're doing

674
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,220
detective work and in the movies and in

675
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,380
TV shows and in the books the detective

676
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,000
always figures out what happened and

677
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,620
they have a clear story and they know

678
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,480
how the person got in and what they did

679
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,179
and it all wraps up neatly with a bow

680
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:10,860
that's not reality

681
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,840
in some cases so much evidence has been

682
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,659
lost or destroyed that there is no way

683
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:18,179
to figure out who done it and I have to

684
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,340
walk away I have to say to this level of

685
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,200
confidence this is what I can tell you

686
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,179
and this is what I can't and I have to

687
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:25,799
be okay with never knowing the answer to

688
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,720
the mystery

689
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,580
um so who might this work well for um

690
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,559
the analysts the perfectionist the risk

691
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:32,820
taker or the collaborator because we're

692
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,440
in these high stress situations with

693
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,840
people who we have to deal with in their

694
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,299
most stressed out situation

695
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,220
you have to be good under pressure

696
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,799
you have to enjoy a mystery and you also

697
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:46,260
have to be a good investigator so you

698
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,520
have to be willing to follow the

699
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,520
scientific method and you know take time

700
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,279
to build a detailed evidenced timeline

701
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,140
so that takes time and that takes

702
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,179
attention to detail you also have to

703
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,220
thrive in chaos because you are walking

704
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,340
into crises day in and day out

705
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,620
who may it not be for well the

706
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,779
technician the Peacekeeper and the buddy

707
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,880
you have to make some people unhappy and

708
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,200
you have to deal with a very very

709
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,360
unhappy people if that's uncomfortable

710
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,460
for you if getting swore at and getting

711
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,460
yelled at and having people cry in front

712
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,380
of you makes you miserable this is not

713
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,360
going to be the job for you you have to

714
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,980
walk in with confidence and tell people

715
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,960
what they need to do even if they're

716
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,940
really

717
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,620
if you're uncomfortable in high pressure

718
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,380
crises this is not the job for you if

719
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,760
you're not patient

720
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,860
this is not the job for you

721
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,840
if you're easily frustrated with human

722
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,520
beings this is not the job for you

723
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,620
because again tired people on their

724
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,840
worst day ever who are very angry at

725
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,240
nothing in particular or at the wrong

726
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,559
targets

727
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,659
if you fail to recognize your own biases

728
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:50,700
you can't do the scientific method ball

729
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,260
and you can't do good investigations

730
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,779
it's not the job for you and if you need

731
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,880
your work-life balance it's probably not

732
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,320
the job for you because you might be

733
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,720
working 48 hours straight on an

734
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,600
investigation without going home

735
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,940
I have some quotes here from people for

736
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,980
you you all to enjoy I ask people to

737
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,659
tell me about the stuff they didn't

738
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,179
enjoy in their work but um here we have

739
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:13,919
a good one um

740
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,260
uh I sometimes put the differ hat for

741
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,700
serious enough incidents in my company

742
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,919
truth is investigating things back to

743
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,380
the initial access sometimes

744
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,960
is it what the customer wants most times

745
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,520
they want enough to be sure that their

746
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,200
environment is clean to get it back up

747
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,059
and running I absolutely agree with this

748
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:32,159
so this is uh what I'm talking about

749
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,779
sometimes you don't get a satisfying

750
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,000
answer and that is very frustrating if

751
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,740
you like to investigate things you have

752
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,080
to be willing to live with that

753
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,820
okay let's move along to another fun

754
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,080
role that a lot of people want to do

755
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,360
which is pen testing or red teaming I'm

756
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,220
going to find some things together

757
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,200
just for the sake of time here

758
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,440
so the job simulate an adversary to test

759
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,940
the digital security of organizations

760
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,760
and prevent real life crime

761
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,159
um so my sales pitch here is wow you get

762
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,539
to hack into things that's really cool

763
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:03,000
that's really fun you are simulating the

764
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,620
people who are committing crimes on the

765
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,360
internet and that means you get to break

766
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,580
into boxes you get to pop boxes you get

767
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,500
to get you know shell on boxes it's

768
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,179
really really cool

769
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:13,980
um you know you're finding stuff you're

770
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,720
you're no exploiting systems you're

771
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,100
moving from system to system maybe

772
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,799
you've got the domain controller wow wow

773
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,179
that's really fun

774
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:23,240
let's talk about the mundane stuff okay

775
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,159
your job isn't finally in the in the

776
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,500
first place improving security and

777
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,380
celebrating your own losses this is

778
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,419
something a lot of young pen testers and

779
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:36,000
red teamers don't get when you lose and

780
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,620
you can't get to the domain controller

781
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,539
that's a good day

782
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:42,120
that means that you have validated that

783
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,679
the security of this organization is

784
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,080
good against the tactics you used hey

785
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,779
that's awesome you should be happy I see

786
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:50,580
a lot of people really unhappy about

787
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,799
that because they didn't they didn't get

788
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,059
rude on a box

789
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,279
so they were bad hackers right no that's

790
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,559
not the point the point is to do a good

791
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,480
test of the security and hopefully the

792
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,179
organization doesn't have failed it

793
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:04,980
um you have to explain to execs and

794
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,779
manager how you got in

795
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,480
so um and also how to prevent it in the

796
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,919
future and you have to do that to

797
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,640
multiple audiences so so execs to

798
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,380
managers to technical people you have to

799
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,600
be explained explaining to them how you

800
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,520
got into these systems

801
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,279
what it means how they can make risk

802
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,100
decisions based on this etc etc so

803
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,840
multiple audiences here you're not just

804
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,480
talking to technical people you might be

805
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,399
talking to a CIO and you have to explain

806
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,080
things in different ways to these

807
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,880
different audiences and you have to be

808
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,380
patient with them and answer their

809
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,539
questions that means a ton of report

810
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:41,159
writing as well

811
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:43,559
lots of report writing sometimes my pen

812
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,020
tester buddies estimate 70 of their job

813
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,000
is report writing

814
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,820
to convey this information they found

815
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,500
about the intrusion to the correct

816
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,740
audiences to again improve the security

817
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,419
and sometimes the stuff you find will

818
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,159
not be fixed by the time you come back

819
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:00,659
again so whether you're working

820
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:02,580
internally or as a consultant you might

821
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,200
come back to the same organization a

822
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,360
year later and this really huge thing

823
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,799
that you thought was really important

824
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:10,799
did get fixed for various reasons

825
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,419
so you have to be okay with that you

826
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:13,860
have to be willing to let it go let it

827
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,779
go let it go

828
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:17,580
um so who might this work well for well

829
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,919
the winner the analyst the Enthusiast

830
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,200
the perfectionist

831
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,840
the collaborator or the Bedrock so a lot

832
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,100
of different personalities can enjoy

833
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,720
this work either from an analytical

834
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,659
standpoint or a creative challenging

835
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:32,600
perspective

836
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,559
kinesthetic Learners this is very very

837
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,059
Hands-On

838
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:38,880
um and uh collaborative Educators people

839
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,799
who like to teach people how to do

840
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,960
better security because that is such a

841
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,299
huge part of your role as a pen tester

842
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:47,820
or a red teamer it's educating The

843
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,820
Defenders the organization in how to do

844
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,559
better Security based on what you found

845
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,720
so if you enjoy that if you're like hey

846
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,980
I can teach them how to do better

847
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,559
security this might be the job for you

848
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,600
and creative Problem Solver so you have

849
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,220
to be very creative to do this job

850
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,840
because you're trying to move from

851
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,820
system to system move laterally get into

852
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,159
different types of systems so yeah you

853
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,539
need to you need to think on your feet

854
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,580
so that's that's great

855
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,220
who might this not be for will the buddy

856
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,779
or the perfectionist because again

857
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,059
sometimes you're going to have to give

858
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,520
people bad news and sometimes you're

859
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,039
going to have to let it go like I

860
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,299
mentioned because you can't change

861
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,980
things

862
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,200
if you're uncomfortable writing detailed

863
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,520
reports

864
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,200
um this is not the job for you or

865
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,240
presenting those reports to a variety of

866
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,659
audience this is not the job for you

867
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,700
if you have to win rather than help

868
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,679
people this is not the right job for you

869
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,419
okay

870
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,760
um if you have an emotional attachment

871
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,000
to quantifiable success so if you have

872
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,820
to win and the systems have to be fixed

873
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,399
and the security has to get better every

874
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:55,440
single time you do a pen test you are

875
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,779
going to be sorely disappointed over and

876
00:31:57,779 --> 00:31:59,820
over and over and over again

877
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,559
so you need to be able to detach

878
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:02,640
yourself from that

879
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,159
you cannot have an emotional investment

880
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,440
in the things that you found in your pen

881
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,480
test from last year being fixed when you

882
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,000
come back the next year it is a growing

883
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,700
curve there's a learning curve here it

884
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,500
takes time for organizations to fix

885
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,539
their security flaws and you are part of

886
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:20,279
that process you are helping them learn

887
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:23,880
and build their security over time

888
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,000
I see I've got some good ones up here

889
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,039
um contesting and red teaming your job

890
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,440
is not super cool Hollywood hacker

891
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,120
sometimes the customer will do

892
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,399
everything right and frustrate you at

893
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:37,740
every turn your job is done to celebrate

894
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,299
their victory

895
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,880
uh well temp uh tempering them against

896
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,399
overconfidence and complacency yeah so

897
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,159
that that was very very well said

898
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,260
um a lot of interesting points here

899
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,480
hacking stuff is mostly worthless in

900
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,880
isolation Improvement comes from leading

901
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,460
the org on a journey I love that as well

902
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,159
again you're thinking about the holistic

903
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,140
picture here of improving cyber security

904
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,140
not just hacking into boxes

905
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,399
threat intelligence all right so the job

906
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:09,539
investigate and collate intelligent

907
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:12,179
Intel projects uh products on what

908
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:14,220
adversaries are doing and how for use in

909
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,080
everything from takedown efforts for

910
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,720
malicious servers to detection

911
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,340
so what's the pitch here

912
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,380
you are investigating adversaries you're

913
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,120
getting ahead of them you're finding out

914
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,100
who they really are and what they do and

915
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,159
how they do things you have gratifying

916
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:30,840
moments of uncovering elusive

917
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,000
adversaries it's really meaningful work

918
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,919
research that will be seen by people all

919
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:36,840
over the world potentially or huge cyber

920
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,419
security communities it's really cool

921
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,460
investigative work

922
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,440
now what's the the boring part of this

923
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,960
work well it's very very tedious you're

924
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,580
looking through tons and tons of data

925
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,380
and you're trying to make useful Intel

926
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,480
products out of it

927
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,640
so you're doing tons of data compilation

928
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,779
as well

929
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:56,940
so you must have a very strong sense of

930
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,279
perseverance and be very very very

931
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,480
patient

932
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,760
you're not always once again going to

933
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,820
get a conclusive answer and again you

934
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,280
have to be willing to let that go if you

935
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,918
don't get a satisfying answer about what

936
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:13,020
the adversary is doing or who they are

937
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,060
you might just not have the data

938
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,800
available to you to make that

939
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,839
determination

940
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,280
um everybody's going to want attribution

941
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,339
too to like a country and you will often

942
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:24,899
not be able to provide that and in a lot

943
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:26,879
of cases it's not wise for you to try to

944
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,980
provide that so you will have to tell

945
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,719
people no to that type of thing a lot

946
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,540
even though you might have a good guess

947
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,139
so uh cyber Intel might work well for

948
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,060
the technician the Bedrock the

949
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,280
Enthusiast during the analysts it works

950
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,719
really well for innovators you have to

951
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,339
be very creative you have to go out

952
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:46,739
there and put things together from zero

953
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:49,080
to try to understand what adversaries

954
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,040
are doing

955
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,260
you have to be very creative you need to

956
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,719
be able to think outside of the box

957
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,639
you have to be willing to recognize your

958
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,380
personal biases because you're doing

959
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,960
again a scientific investigation

960
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,000
and it works well for visual or auditory

961
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,800
Learners you're reading tons of stuff

962
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,839
and potentially listening to tons of

963
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,460
stuff as well

964
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,839
um you're going through lots and lots of

965
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,660
data and good technical writers this is

966
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,339
an amazing place for you because there

967
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:16,440
is so much technical writing that goes

968
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,140
into creating these Intel products

969
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,020
who may it not be for so the winner the

970
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,560
Seeker or the risk taker this is arduous

971
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,180
painstaking time consuming work you have

972
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,280
to be incredibly patient and you're not

973
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,599
always going to get a satisfying

974
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,680
conclusion

975
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,480
you aren't necessarily going to get a

976
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,740
clear-cut answer

977
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,420
and if you don't like to write or

978
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,099
present it's just pretty much a no-go

979
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:39,960
because you are going to be writing so

980
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,960
much in Intel in general various types

981
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,940
of products and reports

982
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,560
if you're I am patient with doing

983
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,140
repetitive analytical work it's not

984
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,280
going to be the place for you either

985
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,760
you're doing again tons of data handling

986
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,920
and you can't be the kind of person who

987
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,040
is unhappy being wrong because you are

988
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,720
eventually sometimes going to be wrong

989
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,319
about things

990
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,599
um another good statement here um Alan

991
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,099
says not every threat and threat

992
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,780
intelligence leads somewhere you may

993
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,000
spread you may spend a few days tracking

994
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,460
an indicator doing weird things only to

995
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,140
find out it's connected to a marketing

996
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,540
tool that's been authorized and vetted

997
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,900
so there's leads that go nowhere and

998
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,240
it's very tedious work but it's very

999
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,160
very valuable and it's very important

1000
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,260
work for what everybody else does in

1001
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,119
cyber security

1002
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,859
okay let's move on to security

1003
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:34,800
architecture engineer to the job design

1004
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,720
and Lead implementation of secure

1005
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,040
networks and security product

1006
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,200
deployments so what's cool here well

1007
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,520
you're the one building the security

1008
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,560
architecture you're the one installing

1009
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,960
the tools you're the one giving people

1010
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,060
the ability to Monitor and to do

1011
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,460
incident response and to do forensics on

1012
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,140
the network you're also building the

1013
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,180
defenses for the network potentially so

1014
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,339
putting in firewalls putting in

1015
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,280
intrusion prevention EDR Etc so it's

1016
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,980
hugely impactful work

1017
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,079
um it is also a relatively nine to five

1018
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,520
job so I talked about an incident

1019
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,020
response there's not a lot of great

1020
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,119
work-life balance there this is a job

1021
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,619
with great work-life balance you get to

1022
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:11,880
go home at the end of the day for the

1023
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,320
most part unless you get called out on

1024
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,660
some kind of emergency like this is a

1025
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,020
normal working office job

1026
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,359
so what's the downside of this job

1027
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,078
um the basics are

1028
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,599
systems work together you have to

1029
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,099
understand how to make them do what they

1030
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:32,339
need to do and tune them appropriately

1031
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,680
um they're not widely implemented Basics

1032
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,540
either so you'll go into a lot of new

1033
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,160
environments and find out that the

1034
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,660
fundamentals aren't done and have to

1035
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,319
start from scratch

1036
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,180
the products you buy or where you put

1037
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,099
them you might get overruled by

1038
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,020
Executives or other other leaders in

1039
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,420
your organization or your engineering

1040
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,500
team

1041
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,780
and it's really kind of a thankless job

1042
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,000
too when things are not broken and they

1043
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,500
are working as design people don't

1044
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,960
notice your existence you know it's just

1045
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,119
kind of one of those roles like a lot of

1046
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,740
engineering roles where people don't

1047
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,540
notice you exist until something goes

1048
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,859
catastrophically wrong and then they

1049
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:09,180
yell at you

1050
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,339
so who might this work well for well the

1051
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:13,740
analysts the Bedrock or the technician

1052
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,900
for those reasons I've described it's

1053
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,119
it's uh you know kind of a routine job

1054
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,280
where there's not a lot of notice

1055
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,140
adapters so you've got to work with

1056
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,880
what's there right so if you're more

1057
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,920
comfortable adapting existing networks

1058
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,619
and systems to do what they need to do

1059
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:29,940
um this might be a great role for you

1060
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,320
because you have to think creatively

1061
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,660
about how to improve security

1062
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,420
if you value long-term success in growth

1063
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,160
if you can think about things in terms

1064
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,420
of years

1065
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,000
um that's that's wonderful

1066
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,660
um

1067
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,880
I like enabling colleagues again this is

1068
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,339
a thing with job so if you like making

1069
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:50,280
people able to do security better even

1070
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,020
if they're not singing your Praises

1071
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,420
every day that's a great role for you

1072
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,920
you are doing really important

1073
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,780
meaningful work even if you don't get a

1074
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,520
bunch of recognition

1075
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,260
good tool development develop scriptures

1076
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,880
if you like to build stuff this is a

1077
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,200
great role as well

1078
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,640
so who might it not be

1079
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,700
well the risk taker The Challenger this

1080
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,180
is this is uh you know just not a job

1081
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,079
where you're going to get a lot of

1082
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,280
recognition and you're going to feel

1083
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,720
like you've accomplished something every

1084
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,700
day you have to be able to think long

1085
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,680
term about your success and be patient

1086
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,880
with it

1087
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,619
um innovators you're not necessarily

1088
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:23,820
going to get to burn down your network

1089
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,280
and start from scratch

1090
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,839
um if you hate scripting it may not be

1091
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,040
the job for you either because you're

1092
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,839
going to have to adapt a lot of tools to

1093
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,720
do new things you configure your tools

1094
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,280
get them working right you're going to

1095
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,500
spend a lot of time at the command line

1096
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,020
if you dislike gradual change if you're

1097
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,599
inpatient with people like users it's

1098
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,400
going to be frustrating work

1099
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,079
and if you need to be in control of

1100
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,900
everything well I got news for you

1101
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,180
you're not again not necessarily going

1102
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,740
to be the final decision maker on

1103
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,160
everything

1104
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,540
oh boy what do we have here I work at

1105
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,160
cyber security architecture part of my

1106
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,320
job is to help teams design Secure

1107
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,599
Solutions but too much of the time it

1108
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,760
seems to boil down to this conversation

1109
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,720
don't be stupid I said don't be stupid

1110
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,960
look don't be stupid why were you stupid

1111
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,700
of course I don't actually get to say

1112
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,839
that

1113
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,280
yeah pretty much sorry malware reversing

1114
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,720
all right do I have any malware

1115
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,339
reversers out there

1116
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:26,220
I got like two oh good okay well I'm

1117
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,560
gonna tell you about it all right so the

1118
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,260
job you take viruses malware apart to

1119
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,780
see what they do so you disassemble them

1120
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,339
you investigate them and you understand

1121
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:39,060
their capacity perhaps who made them how

1122
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,220
they made them and better ways to detect

1123
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,960
them

1124
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,420
um the pitch here is wow you get to

1125
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,640
learn all about malware you get to it's

1126
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,800
a puzzle you get to figure it out figure

1127
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,540
out how malware strains are related to

1128
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,400
one another and what their capacity is

1129
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,859
whether there's something new out there

1130
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:57,660
um perhaps out with the authors get

1131
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,339
detections and prevention mother's

1132
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:01,079
measures out there before the

1133
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:03,540
adversaries are able to do something

1134
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,000
so what's the mundane here well you have

1135
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,220
to know a lot about computer science and

1136
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,260
computer engineering

1137
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,420
um that means like assembly a lot of

1138
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,220
reverse engineering involves reversing

1139
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,619
things in Assembly Language

1140
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,119
um and a lot of people do not enjoy

1141
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:19,380
doing that

1142
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,060
so you're going to constantly need to

1143
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,520
learn new coding new programming

1144
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,320
languages things like that to keep up

1145
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,119
with modern malware

1146
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,400
report writing skills once again we come

1147
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,500
back to these you need to be able to

1148
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,420
report on all this malware you research

1149
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,220
and you need to make this stuff this

1150
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,160
really technical computer stuff

1151
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,140
comprehensible for dumb incident

1152
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,660
responders like me so that we can

1153
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,760
understand what the malware does so you

1154
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,260
need to be able to again write reports

1155
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,960
for multiple audiences and you need a

1156
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,520
lot of focus because you could be

1157
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,440
staring at the same malware piece of

1158
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,500
malware for days weeks maybe even months

1159
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,320
if it's something really noteworthy and

1160
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,480
it has a hugely steep learning curve

1161
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,980
like you have to do all this computer

1162
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,900
engineering or computer science stuff

1163
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,119
you have to understand about how people

1164
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:08,160
build malware you have to understand how

1165
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,720
to take it apart and you have to keep

1166
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,520
this knowledge up to date so big

1167
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,440
learning curve there that's why they get

1168
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,119
paid the big bucks and they do get paid

1169
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,579
the big bucks there's limited training

1170
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,440
out there too I'm relatively compared to

1171
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,420
other initials in cyber security

1172
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,700
so who might malware reversing work well

1173
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,800
for well the Bedrock the analyst or the

1174
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,180
technician you need that patience

1175
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,119
analytical mind

1176
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:31,920
you need to think about new ways to take

1177
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,320
malware apart all the time

1178
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,660
you need to be very patient you need to

1179
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,240
have good methodology

1180
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,980
um you need to be a creative Problem

1181
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,720
Solver as well because you're going to

1182
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,660
be dealing with people who try to

1183
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,160
confuse you and you know break your

1184
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,900
decompilers

1185
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,060
um during your reverse engineering they

1186
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,619
the the malware authors know you're

1187
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:53,880
there and they're going to try to make

1188
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,560
your life hell they're going to write

1189
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,119
their code in confusing ways and they're

1190
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,980
going to try to outwit you because they

1191
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,060
know you're going to try to take apart

1192
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,040
their malware so you're going to need to

1193
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,900
like an intellectual challenge because

1194
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,280
everything's going to be a puzzle and

1195
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,020
you're going to be thwarted

1196
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,760
and you need strong computer science

1197
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,099
skills once again you need to know a lot

1198
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:12,900
about

1199
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,819
pewter's work and how pointers work how

1200
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:16,200
assembly works

1201
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,940
so who might it not be for well the

1202
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,859
Seeker or the Enthusiast no quick wins

1203
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:20,700
here

1204
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,540
visual Learners because again you

1205
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,980
there's not a lot out there in terms of

1206
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,200
educational materials and you're going

1207
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,119
to be reading a lot of code in a lot of

1208
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:32,280
books if you're impatient or you're

1209
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,500
easily frustrated this is not the role

1210
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,660
to get into if you don't like lots of

1211
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,960
code or particularly purposefully messy

1212
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,000
code this is not the job role for you

1213
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,099
and if you don't like to write detailed

1214
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,079
reports about what you found that again

1215
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,240
dumb incident responders like me can

1216
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,680
understand not the job for you

1217
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,520
here's one

1218
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,319
you're gonna you're gonna write you're

1219
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:57,000
gonna write a lot you may believe

1220
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,220
writing is not why you got into this but

1221
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,079
to be effective you need to do it well

1222
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:03,599
all the work you do is worthless if you

1223
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,700
can't effectively convey that work into

1224
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,060
actionable writing wow and then somebody

1225
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,339
else commented James commented add two

1226
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:13,260
additional hours to whatever reversing

1227
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,540
you're planning two additional hours to

1228
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,680
the reversing work you do that day oh

1229
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,359
vulnerability management so this is one

1230
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,800
that a lot of people think sounds boring

1231
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,819
but it's actually really really

1232
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:26,160
important so discover a document and

1233
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,660
manage patching or exceptions for

1234
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,000
vulnerable systems across the Enterprise

1235
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,700
pitch here discover the reality of a

1236
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,200
network what's really really going on

1237
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,420
there okay

1238
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,400
um take that network from Zero to Hero

1239
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,740
this is a nine to five job again this is

1240
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,180
something you can do with work-life

1241
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,119
balance you're the one planning for

1242
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,400
patching systems understanding what's

1243
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,520
vulnerable in your environment etc etc

1244
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,460
the mundane the fundamentals of cyber

1245
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,099
security often don't exist at all and

1246
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,540
sometimes there's reasons they can't

1247
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,940
exist in your environment sometimes you

1248
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,859
don't have good asset inventory so you

1249
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:03,660
don't know where the vulnerable systems

1250
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,119
are so this job requires tenacity

1251
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:07,800
empathy and patience

1252
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,480
who made it work well for the

1253
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,099
collaborator the Peacekeeper or the

1254
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:12,240
technician you have to work with people

1255
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,800
here you have to be cooperative and you

1256
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,119
have to be patient

1257
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,940
analytical and organized people adopters

1258
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,640
people who valid value projectize

1259
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,819
Improvement and value work-life balance

1260
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:26,339
who's it not for the winner the risk

1261
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:29,339
taker Enthusiast this is again kind of a

1262
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:31,140
thankless job and it requires a lot of

1263
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,180
patience in working with people

1264
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,740
it's not a great job for innovators

1265
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,599
you're trying to fix things

1266
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:38,880
it's not good if you're inflexible and

1267
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,440
it's not good if you're impatient in

1268
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,460
general

1269
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,079
and if you're easily frustrated with

1270
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,000
people not doing what you want or what

1271
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,160
you hope for you're gonna be really

1272
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,900
really unhappy

1273
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,180
so here are what we got um vulnerability

1274
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,460
management the worst time is the worst

1275
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,079
part is trying to find ownership on

1276
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:56,700
systems that don't show up in the asset

1277
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,079
inventory

1278
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,119
usually maintenance interfaces trying to

1279
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:02,160
sort out who maintains what

1280
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,380
through load balancers is a hoot too

1281
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,020
yeah there's a lot of frustration on

1282
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:07,920
this one

1283
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,760
um

1284
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,859
all right governance risk and compliance

1285
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:12,540
another important job that people think

1286
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,180
about a lot so quantify risk and guide

1287
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,040
decision making in your organization

1288
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,339
around cyber security risk and

1289
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:23,060
the policy

1290
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,680
so the decision maker for what you spend

1291
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,599
on cyber security and where you put it

1292
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:32,579
and what people you get and how you

1293
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:34,680
train them and what risks you're willing

1294
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,839
to accept is an organization and if

1295
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:38,280
you're in compliance with various

1296
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,660
standards

1297
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,579
and this is important you get to be a

1298
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:43,319
key decision maker to ensure the company

1299
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:45,060
makes the best security decisions

1300
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,460
possible you're doing a really important

1301
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,980
thing and it's once again got work-life

1302
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,260
balance this is nine to five work

1303
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,180
what's the boring part well you're

1304
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,859
reading a whole bunch of compliance

1305
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:58,440
stuff and regulations and they can be

1306
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,099
Arcane I mean read like PCI stuff oh my

1307
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:05,160
God and the other really negative part

1308
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,079
here is orbs will think they're secure

1309
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:08,880
because they check the box and you're

1310
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,819
like no no you're not secure it's not

1311
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:14,099
PCI doesn't cut it and they don't care

1312
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:15,780
because they check the box and their

1313
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,640
lawyers are happy and their insurers are

1314
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,440
happy you have to deal with lots of

1315
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,880
contracts and you'll have to deal with

1316
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,680
lots of politics and be a good

1317
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,540
politician to get what you need

1318
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,339
it might work well for the Challenger

1319
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:28,200
the collaborator the Peacekeeper or the

1320
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,140
Bedrock it's great for adapters it's

1321
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,700
great for people focused people if

1322
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,380
you're a people person this might be an

1323
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,359
amazing role for you because you're good

1324
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:37,920
at negotiating

1325
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,560
creative problem solvers absolutely work

1326
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,020
with the budgets you've got and valuing

1327
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,900
work-life balance who's it maybe not for

1328
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,540
the risk taker The Seeker the buddy or

1329
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,760
the perfectionist this is a thankless

1330
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,099
job it's a Cooperative job and it

1331
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:55,440
requires patience and ability to work

1332
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,440
with people innovators inflexible people

1333
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,780
people who get impatient with people or

1334
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,060
processes people were uncomfortable

1335
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,740
making hard calls

1336
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,380
when we got here

1337
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,300
holy crap I forgot about contract

1338
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,160
negotiations I think that's more of a

1339
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,319
GRC thing thankfully that's not

1340
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:15,119
that's my regular job I've asked people

1341
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,099
on a call before can you just come to my

1342
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:20,220
house and shoot me down please

1343
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,619
I understand

1344
00:48:21,619 --> 00:48:24,359
yeah contract negotiations

1345
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:27,839
yeah that's part of DRC sorry guys at

1346
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,480
second product security the job

1347
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,220
see you are the bridge between the

1348
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,980
people who make things widgets products

1349
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,319
software and cyber security that's

1350
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:38,940
really really really important we can

1351
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,980
all agree that having password zero zero

1352
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,920
dot on everything that we buy is kind of

1353
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,380
not great but it happens

1354
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,780
and you could be that person who finally

1355
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,640
makes all those smart home devices this

1356
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,500
internet of things things or the

1357
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,079
software you buy actually secure that's

1358
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:57,119
awesome that's a huge project for the

1359
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,859
entire world right now

1360
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:00,599
all right so what's the downside here

1361
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:02,819
well first of all budgets are King in a

1362
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:05,160
lot of these environments and that

1363
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,200
relationship between the developers or

1364
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,480
the engineers and cyber security can be

1365
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,819
super hostile so this requires a

1366
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:13,880
delicate touch and a good negotiator

1367
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,079
everything involves creating and

1368
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,760
tracking documentation as well because

1369
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,160
you're part of the Engineering Process

1370
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,540
so it might work well for the

1371
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,540
Peacekeeper the Buddy the collaborator

1372
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,460
um adapters as well because you're again

1373
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,079
trying to work with an existing thing

1374
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,420
and make it better good diplomats and

1375
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,859
negotiators

1376
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:33,119
and people who have a strong

1377
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,920
understanding of product development

1378
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,420
life cycles whether that's building

1379
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,420
physical Widgets or software development

1380
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,819
it might not be for the risk taker the

1381
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:43,440
winner of the perfectionist

1382
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,020
might not be for innovators might that

1383
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,520
be for anybody who's a poor people

1384
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,660
person

1385
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,760
people who are not okay with compromise

1386
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,440
you will need to make a lot of

1387
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,839
compromises in this role and if you're

1388
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:57,180
uncomfortable negotiating this is not

1389
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,619
going to be the role for you you need to

1390
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:00,540
do a lot of negotiating to get the

1391
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,579
security you can the best security you

1392
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:04,859
can for the budget implemented in this

1393
00:50:04,859 --> 00:50:07,500
software or the widgets Etc

1394
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,260
all right

1395
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,599
roll product security or appsec boring

1396
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:14,640
part chasing tickets you generate work

1397
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,200
that another team needs to do to

1398
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,119
increase our security and reduce risk in

1399
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:19,800
a ticket but then you actually have to

1400
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,180
track that ticket and make sure they

1401
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,579
actually do it multiply that one ticket

1402
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:26,520
by a hundred or so

1403
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,859
okay

1404
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,380
physical pen testing oh this is this is

1405
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,819
a sexy job everybody wanted to hear

1406
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:34,619
about everybody's like yeah I heard all

1407
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:36,000
these cool stories about physical pen

1408
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,380
testing oh my God these are the people

1409
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,940
who break into buildings they get to rob

1410
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,339
banks so they test the security of an

1411
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:43,140
organization by physically intruding

1412
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,300
into their facilities to conduct to

1413
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,859
conduct objectives whether that's

1414
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:48,660
getting into a computer system or just

1415
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,099
getting into the building

1416
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:52,500
the pitch is easy here guys you get to

1417
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,300
break into buildings oh my God you get

1418
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,740
to sneak your way in you get to be a

1419
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,480
ninja you get to pick locks you get to

1420
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,579
crack safes oh my God

1421
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:01,319
okay let's talk about the boring part of

1422
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:04,440
this really really sexy cool job okay

1423
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,020
um first of all you can potentially get

1424
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,940
somebody fired in this job very very

1425
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,920
easily if you social engineer somebody

1426
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,359
to let you into the building and they're

1427
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:14,280
not supposed to you're going to put

1428
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,200
their name on the report that's just how

1429
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,700
it works and they might get fired

1430
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,079
unfairly because of that and then that's

1431
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:20,280
going to be

1432
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,319
I mean it's not on you it's not your

1433
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:23,880
decision in the end but you may feel

1434
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,440
like it is your decision in the end you

1435
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,880
may feel responsible for that

1436
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,800
emotionally

1437
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,780
um there are still a ton of report

1438
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,240
writing again that's 70 of the the job

1439
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,619
is report writing

1440
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:36,780
you don't succeed unless you're helping

1441
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,819
improve security so just breaking in

1442
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:41,760
doesn't cut it again your job is to make

1443
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,260
the security of the organization better

1444
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,180
and if you're failing at conveying

1445
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,880
change and improving security as a

1446
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,619
result of what you've done you are

1447
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:51,359
failing so you need those good report

1448
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,579
writing skills and the ability to teach

1449
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:55,740
and convey information

1450
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,200
it's not as glamorous as you think and I

1451
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,119
cut some good quotes on this one about

1452
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:02,040
how unglamorous it can actually be

1453
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,020
sitting outside in the Sun or the rain

1454
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,480
trying to get into a building and

1455
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,099
there's a high likelihood you're going

1456
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:09,420
to end up in jail

1457
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,460
temporarily yes you'll have your get out

1458
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,400
of jail pre-card but in reality people

1459
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,660
are going to take you to jail before

1460
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,119
they start looking for paperwork so you

1461
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:19,380
can definitely and it's happened there's

1462
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,380
been some high profile cases in the news

1463
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,720
um where people spent substantial

1464
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,700
amounts of time in jail as pen testers

1465
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,559
who were completely authorized breaking

1466
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,260
into buildings so it might work well for

1467
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,839
the risk taker The Seeker the Enthusiast

1468
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,819
or the perfectionist it's a great job

1469
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,220
for innovators can aesthetic Learners

1470
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,900
you're always Hands-On you're cracking

1471
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,520
safes you're breaking into locks things

1472
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,160
like that good social Engineers this is

1473
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,720
the job for you man you're going to get

1474
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,880
to talk your way into buildings if

1475
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,619
you're you're a good used car salesman

1476
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:51,839
this is a job for you strong physical

1477
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,460
security skills you've got to be able to

1478
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,200
break into stuff and understand how

1479
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,000
locks work and understand how doors work

1480
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,520
and things like that it might not be for

1481
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,440
people like the Buddy the collaborator

1482
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,059
the Peacekeeper or the bed rack you

1483
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:04,319
gotta trick people and you can get them

1484
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,480
in a a lot of trouble you've got to be

1485
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,400
comfortable lying to people you've got

1486
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,040
to be comfortable manipulating people

1487
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,319
and for a good cause too it's not going

1488
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:14,460
to be a good job if you're impatient

1489
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,480
you're going to have to do a lot of

1490
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,819
waiting to get into buildings or to get

1491
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:20,339
what you need out of an organization

1492
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:22,440
poor presenters or report writers again

1493
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,180
you are not going to accomplish anything

1494
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,339
if you're uncomfortable manipulating

1495
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:28,020
people if you're uncomfortable getting

1496
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,180
caught and having to face some temporary

1497
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,579
consequences if you're uncomfortable

1498
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:34,440
being uncomfortable got these quotes

1499
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,180
I've got so many of them from these

1500
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:36,960
people

1501
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,740
uh-huh

1502
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,420
um sitting outside in the in the rain in

1503
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,119
anorak Waiting desperately for a

1504
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,520
particular client with a weak signal in

1505
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,200
a server room somewhere to connect to

1506
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,540
the corporate Wi-Fi trying to look

1507
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,660
inconspicuous for half a day that sounds

1508
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,720
horrible that sounds awful

1509
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:58,980
um I always thought this job was really

1510
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,900
sexy and then I got to read all these

1511
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,640
quotes about being stuck in the sun and

1512
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,440
the rain and waiting for people and not

1513
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,200
being able to pee in things because

1514
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,339
they're waiting for their opportunity to

1515
00:54:08,339 --> 00:54:09,900
get into a building and you don't see

1516
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,160
that part in the movies they don't show

1517
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,420
the part where they they don't they

1518
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,800
can't go pee for four hours because

1519
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,000
they're trying to follow somebody

1520
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,260
they're trying to shoulder steer

1521
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,880
somebody

1522
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,540
um

1523
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,940
finally exploit bug and vulnerability

1524
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,859
research so the job is research things

1525
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,500
to find means for exploitation disclose

1526
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,420
with the vendor and security firms so

1527
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,980
you are the rock star who uncovers

1528
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,420
meaningful bugs and how they can be

1529
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,980
exploited hopefully ahead of the

1530
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,559
adversaries it can be very well paid and

1531
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,680
it can also be self-employed self-paced

1532
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,480
what's the downside of this work bug

1533
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,520
hunting exploit research vulnerability

1534
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,460
research while there's lots of writing

1535
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,260
because you have to the only way you're

1536
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,579
going to get paid is if you write up

1537
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:49,380
these bugs in vulnerabilities well at

1538
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,240
least the very meaningful ones

1539
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,460
sometimes you'll be ignored some people

1540
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,839
sometimes people won't listen to you

1541
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:56,819
sometimes you'll be scooped by another

1542
00:54:56,819 --> 00:54:58,859
researcher and they'll get the Bounty or

1543
00:54:58,859 --> 00:55:01,319
the glory and not you and it's not

1544
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:03,059
glamorous for the majority there's a ton

1545
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:05,760
of people who do this and only a small

1546
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,280
number relatively are incredibly famous

1547
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,839
and successful

1548
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,760
it might work well for the winner the

1549
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,559
Seeker the analysts or the perfectionist

1550
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:15,119
you have to work hard you have to be

1551
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,920
willing to take risks you have to be

1552
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,619
willing to persevere

1553
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:21,900
um Visual and kinesthetic Learners

1554
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,300
um you have to be flexible you have to

1555
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,619
have strong research and computer

1556
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:27,960
science skills both of those so you have

1557
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,000
to both be able to investigate things

1558
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,319
having to do with computers and

1559
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:33,180
understand at a very rudimentary level

1560
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:36,180
and very fundamental level how computers

1561
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,160
are engineered and how they work

1562
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,020
it might not be for the Peacekeeper or

1563
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,300
the technician because this is not

1564
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,700
necessarily study work it's not

1565
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,240
necessarily always Glory based work and

1566
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,680
if you don't like writing detailed

1567
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,599
reports it won't be a happy job for you

1568
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,940
if you're overly invested in visible

1569
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,520
success you might be going into this job

1570
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,980
for the wrong reasons because again the

1571
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,720
vast majority of people in these roles

1572
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,700
are not the big names that you see

1573
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,680
producing the really really famous stuff

1574
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,559
a lot of people work for years at bug

1575
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:10,619
bounty hunting and just make a basic

1576
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:13,339
living on it they're not making millions

1577
00:56:13,339 --> 00:56:16,280
if you want Study work and income

1578
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,960
especially like the the self-employed

1579
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,540
work here is not necessarily reliable

1580
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,099
you have to be bold and you have to be

1581
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:25,700
working hard

1582
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,280
um so Reed says embedded system security

1583
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,760
testing hot doing the bug hunting not

1584
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,859
writing the report the first part

1585
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:36,599
definitely requires creative thinking

1586
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:39,359
and rapidly or wildly testing theories

1587
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,579
the second requires thoroughness and

1588
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:43,559
attention to detail they're very

1589
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:45,720
different brains you have to have both

1590
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,880
of those things to succeed in that area

1591
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,280
so in summary

1592
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,920
I Leslie cannot Auntie Leslie cannot

1593
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,660
tell you for sure what job you'll enjoy

1594
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,640
I can't tell you what personality type

1595
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,920
you are I could give you some clues

1596
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,079
about what you might not like and what

1597
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:03,599
sounds interesting I tried to give you a

1598
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,339
little bit more of the negative because

1599
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,619
there's you could go out on YouTube and

1600
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:09,300
watch a hundred security talks about any

1601
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,800
one of these niches and see how cool

1602
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,780
they are but I wanted to give you a

1603
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,400
little bit of the stuff we don't see in

1604
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,720
those talks so you can make a better

1605
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,280
decision

1606
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,440
what I can suggest now is go explore

1607
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,720
find out more about the fields that

1608
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,760
stood out to you today watch talks about

1609
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,760
them try to Shadow those job roles I

1610
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,260
think that you will find a niche that

1611
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,180
you enjoy if you take the time to really

1612
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,800
explore these and figure out what's

1613
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,720
going to work for you

1614
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,940
