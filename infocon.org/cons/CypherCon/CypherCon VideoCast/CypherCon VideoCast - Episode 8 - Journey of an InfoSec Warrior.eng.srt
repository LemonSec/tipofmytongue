17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,280
interesting paths that you took and i

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,480
was wondering if uh

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,879
you could talk a little bit about that

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,239
for the audience because it sounds

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,680
pretty you've done a lot of interesting

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,360
things

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,239
sure uh i mean to start off my journey

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,520
first off i gotta admit

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,640
like i'm a big geek uh i mean i started

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,480
in computers in high school

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,000
um in the early 90s late 80s

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
my first girlfriend i actually met over

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
a dial-up modem

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,200
on a galacticon multi-line bbs so that

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,880
gives you an idea of how much of a geek

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,920
i am but

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,159
but my passion in high school you know

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,320
my two passions were music and computers

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:14,960
and

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,439
originally started off uh as a music

37
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,600

38
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,080

and uh oh and not even a year there my

48
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,040
first semester there and i

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
i kind of got burned out had some bad

50
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,040
experiences i actually had a

51
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,000
had a friend dying of cancer and had an

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,240
opportunity to go see him one last time

53
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,720
and like

54
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,880
my music professor just tore me a new

55
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,439
one because i missed a concert to do it

56
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,320
so i was kind of burned out and to pay

57
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,439
for school

58
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,960
i was working at a small computer shop

59
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
in brookfield wisconsin doing break and

60
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,240
fix work

61
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,160
of just building computers and like

62
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,080
really learning the basics this is back

63
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,760
in 92

64
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,840
and uh a vp at a consulting firm had

65
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,200
bought his computer from there and i

66
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,879
ended up doing some break and fix

67
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,560
work which then led to me doing some

68
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,560
networking work for him

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,760
and he really kind of uh

70
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,239
found that i had a knack and skills for

71
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,760
technology

72
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,920
and we got into discussing security and

73
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,959
stuff and he

74
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,800
was a vp at a boutique

75
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,160
consulting firm called cpu in milwaukee

76
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,959
and he kind of took me under his wing

77
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,160
gave me a job

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,000
taught me the ropes and i started my

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,599
career in there and then six months

80
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,120
after working for mac

81
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,440
um cpu got bought out by copywear

82
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,720
which you know back in the uh

83
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,640
early to mid 90s compuware was one of

84
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,480
the largest consulting firms on the

85
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,080
planet

86
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,560
so i spent a couple years there you know

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,480
really kind of digging into

88
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,120
learning the ropes first-hand hands-on

89
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,080
basis of information security and

90
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,519
uh at that time young ambitious no kids

91
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,400
no family no commitments

92
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,640
dot com boom kind of saw the writing on

93
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,000
the wall of it coming

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,159
so i decided to fork out on my own and

95
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,080
start my own business and just travel

96
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,840
all over the world

97
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,799
just looking for the coolest most

98
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,519
challenging

99
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,000
infosec gigs you know that i could find

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,959
which

101
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,640
you know i spent 10 years of my life

102
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,239
traveling basically 100

103
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,040
of the time all over the world doing all

104
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,640
sorts of cool stuff made a lot of

105
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,080
government friends got a lot of

106
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,840
government contracts

107
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,519
did a lot of social engineering and pen

108
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,640
testing breaking into banks

109
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,280
breaking into dod facilities you know we

110
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,879
were talking earlier i wrote one of the

111
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,879
first manuals for department of justice

112
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,799
back in the mid 90s on how to seize

113
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,640
electronic evidence because

114
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,799
you'd give law enforcement a warrant

115
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,480
that had servers and computers on it

116
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,840
back then and be like a deer in

117
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
headlights

118
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,439
i know how to seize drugs or a bad guy

119
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,640
how do i seize a computer

120
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,560
so you know found myself doing that for

121
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,238
a decade and

122
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,120
then decided uh after i got shot which

123
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,040
is a long story in and of itself

124
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,520
um tell me about that how did you get

125
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,720
shot

126
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,280
well when i wrote the manual for doj

127
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,000
actually my buddy ernie and i did

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,440
and uh we had just finished the final

129
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,400
draft of it

130
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,800
and doj had gotten a call from the dea

131
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,639
of hey we have this bank

132
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,400
that the dea is working with the

133
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,919
peruvian government

134
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,199
on uh investigating for drug laundering

135
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,960
because we're pretty sure that they're

136
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,120
laundering drugs for a colombian cartel

137
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,560
it's an international bank they have

138
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,080
branches in both the us

139
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,280
and all through atlanta and

140
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,880
you know they worked with the peruvian

141
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,160
government they have these warrants and

142
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,000
they have computers and stuff on them

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,400
we don't know what to do oh we got just

144
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,000
the guys we'll send them down to oversee

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,320
collection of evidence

146
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,600
so they sent ernie and i down there and

147
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,280
then yep we were in lima and

148
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,360
i mean we didn't really we were young

149
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,120
and

150
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,720
naive and didn't have any idea what

151
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,479
we're getting into but you know

152
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,560
should have been a clue when we walk in

153
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,759
and you know all these d

154
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,039
agents are you know putting on kevlar

155
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:29,919
and

156
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,280
you know there's working with the

157
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,600
peruvian military in full gear

158
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,240
oh wow and you know it's one of these

159
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,320
okay well you guys wait outside here

160
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,240
you know we're gonna go in and we'll

161
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,919
clear the bank and after everything is

162
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,759
all clear and stuff we'll bring you guys

163
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,160
in to oversee collection of evidence

164
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,360
so they went in and they cleared

165
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,199
everything out and they they

166
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,039
brought us and oversee collection of

167
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,280

and and all professional wasn't that big

172
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,280
a threat

173
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,880
you know they patted them down on that

174
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,360
but apparently somehow they had missed

175
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,280
that i guess somewhere in his suit coat

176
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,400
he had a little

177
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,280
38 snub nose revolver like sewn into it

178
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,080
and the next thing you know i hear gun

179
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,919
bang and

180
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,280
and i got clipped where it hit me

181
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,319
in the top of my right calf and came out

182
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,759
the bottom of my right calf

183
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,240
oh man and the next thing you know

184
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,919
there's a

185
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,160
a d asian and a peruvian corpsman like

186
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,199
running up to me

187
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,680
and like while i'm standing there the

188
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,240
guy

189
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,759
pulls out a med kit um is trying to

190
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,440
convince me to lay down but i'm kind of

191
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,960
in shock and don't know what's going on

192
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,039
pulls out a scalpel and slices my calf

193
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,720
open to clamp off the artery because

194
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,319
then clipped the femoral artery and i

195
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,840
guess it was like squirting

196
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,680
oh wow which point i pass out cold

197
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,160
and i wake up on a helicopter that's we

198
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,680
as well didn't know

199
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,520
was flying us to a carrier sitting in

200
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,440
the gulf where special forces were

201
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,080
waiting

202
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,440
in case something went wrong oh my gosh

203
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,479

205
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,680

210
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,560
birthdays i got to think about that 96.

211

and i could not tell my own family about

222
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,160
that that was classified up until

223
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,080
probably about 15 years ago

224
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,400
oh wow and up until that point i

225

work on space equipment like the hubble

240
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,720
and

241
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,879

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,080
particular and

243
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,680
optics that shall we say point in the

244
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,440
other direction

245
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,399

251
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,560
and you get you know

252
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,399
a small group of cyber security

253
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,160
professionals who haven't experienced

254
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,680
this everyone else is like oh you're

255

256
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,200
happened

257
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,000
and we've worked in facilities where i

258
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,800
mean you go and

259
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,640
upgrade say the memory on a secure

260
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,040
router you know especially back in the

261
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,160
mid 90s

262
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,240
you know early 90s cold war era stuff

263
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,720
and you lift the cover off and i kid you

264
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
not there's a trip wire with a grenade

265
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,320
that you have to snip before you take

266
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,120
the cover off

267
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,320
wow you know it's just some

268
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,360
crazy wild stuff so how did you how did

269
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,720
you find how did you go about

270
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,640
finding these you said that you were

271
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
always seeking out the coolest

272
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,160
things that you could do in the world

273
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,920
how did you go about finding these when

274
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,320
you were

275
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,160
you know when you were starting out yeah

276
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,600
i mean the internet

277
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,920
the internet was starting to take off

278
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,600
and i had made a lot of contacts on the

279
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,279
government side

280
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,640
um and just started branching out

281
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,959
globally and i mean

282
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,680
i originally when mac found me and

283
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
noticed my talent

284
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,480
i may have been involved in a few gray

285
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,839
area things

286
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,519
you know as as we all are sometimes yeah

287
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,120
you know this was when i was young and a

288
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,040
kid and didn't know any better and made

289
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,120
made a lot of contacts and just i'm very

290
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,120
social to begin with and i network a lot

291
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,079
so so it was kind of getting that

292
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,920
experience getting that network and then

293
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,760
leveraging your network to find the cool

294
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,440
jobs that you can get

295
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,279
yeah well and it's easy to build a name

296
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,880
for yourself because like during the

297
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
dot-com boom you know i'm sure every

298
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,480
security professional who was around

299
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,680
that knows you know

300
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,079
you had this whole growth period where

301
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:24,959
the idea of

302
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,200
a pen test for like a lot of firms took

303
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,480
advantage of this

304
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,720
of you know i'll run a nessus or like an

305
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,800
iss scan against you i'll weed out the

306
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,160
false positives and i'll give you a

307
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,480
report and there you're pen tested

308
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,320
well i'd go in behind those guys

309
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,480
especially to like banks

310
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,279
and i'd be like okay dude so like i know

311
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,200
who did your last pen test i tell you

312
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,760
what

313
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,200
here's my fee you put it into an account

314
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,760
and if i get it out of the account i get

315
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
paid you get your report if i don't

316
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,880
i'll still give you your report and

317
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,959
there's times i'd go in behind firms

318
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,760
like that and i just specially exploit

319
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,360
some of the psychological and social

320
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,640
aspects

321
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,720
and uh let's just say i had a very

322
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,560
successful success rate

323
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,760
interesting wow think about it

324
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,240
okay you know even today you go in and

325
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,399
it's the simple psychological things

326
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,160
the first thing i would do for any pen

327
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,320
test find out what their logo is

328
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,120
and go and get a polo shirt print it up

329
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,040
with their logo on it

330
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,519
and you know bank branch i have walked

331
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,279
into bank branches

332
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,399
with their logo clothing on cold

333
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,720
never been in there before and i will

334
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,000
walk right behind

335
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,519
the tellers workstations and start

336
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,440
plugging in keystroke loggers

337
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,800
holy cow wow you know

338
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,959
and i'll have bank manager walk up to me

339
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,079
you know hey

340
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,360
i haven't seen you before what are you

341
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
doing here oh i t sent me over from

342
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,040
corporate there's a problem with you

343
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,600
know

344
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,120
some of your equipment and stuff can you

345
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,800
let me into the wiring closet

346
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,000
oh sure here you go boom right in

347
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,040
you know wow

348
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,839
so is it easier then then i mean it's

349
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,040
not i mean

350
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,600
do you still see some of that today or

351
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,480
is it

352
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,800
oh yeah it's buttoned down more than it

353
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,600
used to be

354
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,560
and i mean as society as a whole has

355
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,399
become more aware as this happens more

356
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,720
on it's gotten better but it's still

357
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,000
i mean i mean if anybody

358
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,320
doesn't believe me get get a shirt print

359
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,000
it up with a logo on it

360
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,399
go by their loading dock and you know at

361
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,160
a prime time people are going in

362
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,079
and hold a you know stack of empty boxes

363
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:36,880
even

364
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,399
and walk behind somebody and see who

365
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,240
holds the door open for you

366
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,519
you know wow it's human nature

367
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,320
people want to be helpful you know just

368
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,079
like your hackers too when you look at

369
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,839
risk versus reward they want to follow

370
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,720
the path of least resistance

371
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,839
you know i actually published

372
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,680
an article on linkedin about this you

373
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,880
know that's part of what's driving

374
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,480
a big debate in the industry about

375
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,320
network visibility and

376
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,399
being able to decrypt all your traffic

377
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,360
and stuff and the

378
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,320
the battle over you know should the

379
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,200
government allow

380
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,240
secret you know backdoors and decryption

381
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,760
and shouldn't they and what's the value

382
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,279
of decryption today

383
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,079
so when you get in with tls 1.3

384
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,600
elliptical curve ciphers

385
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,800
pfs you know it's gotten harder and

386
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,399
harder as encryption gets better to

387
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,920
break into the pipes

388
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,040
so you know we're not seeing very many

389
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,079
man in the middle

390
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,320
or interception attacks these days

391
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,760
they've moved on and your biggest

392
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,519
attacks are ransomware

393
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,000
they're on phishing attacks they're on

394
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,160
you know ddos for ransom attacks

395
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,199
because to quote jesse james one that's

396
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,320
where the money is

397
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,440
just like why they used to rob banks and

398
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,760
two

399
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,360
they follow the path of least resistance

400
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,279
if you see a car with an alarm and one

401
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,399
without

402
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,760
which one are you gonna hit you're gonna

403
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,680
hit the one without the alarm

404
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,199
well it's not to say that they don't

405
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,279
have alarms but

406
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,480
breaking encryption with pfs and tls 1.3

407
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,639
and stronger encryption keys is a harder

408
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,680
target

409
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,600
when your endpoint controls suck and you

410
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,040
can just you know

411
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,519
pop up a web server that's processing

412
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,000
200 000 credit cards an hour and sit on

413
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,440
there and just sniff them

414
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,399
one after another you know but companies

415
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:20,880
are still

416
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,639
tending to invest millions of dollars

417
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,959
because you know the other side of that

418
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,560
coin is as decryption

419
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,160
and encryption gets better it gets

420
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
harder to decrypt it gets more expensive

421
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,760
to decrypt

422
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,839
you know especially as bandwidth

423
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,120
increases

424
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,800
so you have to find a happy balance

425
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,880
between both of them and

426
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,000
you know i butt heads regularly

427
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,160
you know with other professionals in the

428
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,519
industry that you know oh my gosh you

429
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,079
have to have

430
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,519
every packet and ideally in an ideal

431
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,040
world if i had a blank checkbook

432
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,120
you bet i sure as heck would but

433
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,279
businesses still have to

434
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,440
generate a profit and generate revenue

435
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,120
and you got to find a happy balance

436
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,880
between what you really need to see

437
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,440
and where the value and that is versus

438
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,800
investing some of that money and better

439
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
endpoint controls

440
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,600
yeah yeah and i think you know you hit

441
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,880
it on the head when you're talking about

442
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,279
phishing attacks too because you know

443
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,320
the weakest link in any system is the

444
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,199
people right

445
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,320
so it's about you know how how can i

446
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,480
figure out how to get uh somebody's

447
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,160
credentials so that i can get into the

448
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,600
system and then figure out how i can get

449
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,720
in from you know

450
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,440
further uh further through the network

451
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,079
once i

452
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,759
get one piece of it right yep i mean

453
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,839
some of the psychological stuff and you

454
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,519
know you can come up with some really

455
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,000
creative

456
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,040
low-cost controls that that cost

457
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,680
so little but play on the psychology

458
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
that are so effective it's crazy

459
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,920
i was working on a campus environment

460
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,040
that had

461
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,720
a requirement everybody has to wear

462
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,800
their security badge you know

463
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,560
people walking around you were supposed

464
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,720
to question you know where's your badge

465
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,399
and when i started there they probably

466
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,680
had about

467
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,079
50 to 75 percent compliance with that

468
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,600
policy

469
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,800
so you know i spent 800 bucks a year

470
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,279
four times a year i'd bring in literally

471
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,199
somebody off the street who clearly

472
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,639
didn't belong there

473
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,880
i'd give him 200 bucks and i'd say here

474
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,639
you wander around campus

475
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,480
the first person that stops you you hand

476
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,920
them a 100 bill

477
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,720
and you can keep the second one and i

478
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,759
mean within

479
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,959
24 hours we would go from

480
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,160
you know a 50 to 75 compliance rate to

481
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,120
over 99

482
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,399
compliance rate wow a detection time of

483
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,000
somebody not wearing a badge i mean

484
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,560
people were

485
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,360
actively looking for it you know it it

486
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,759
all

487
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,639
plays on psychology yeah aligning those

488
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,079
incentives if

489
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,880
if i can get 100 bucks for uh reporting

490
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,360
someone

491
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,320
uh yeah i'll be are asking him right

492
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,720
like

493
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,519
i'll do that yep and and it's risk

494
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,199
versus reward you know it's the other

495
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,959
thing i harp on and i don't get why more

496
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,000
companies don't do this

497
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,720
every application every database you

498
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,679
know

499
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,280
you should be thinking about you know

500
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,640
how to detect malicious activity using

501
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,839
low-cost psychology put into in your

502
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,760
application put in a user account of

503
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,599
jbezos

504
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,359
you know with a password that's just

505
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,720
weak enough that it's going to be one of

506
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,319
the first ones popped

507
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,319
what hacker do you think in your right

508
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,520
mind

509
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,120
like especially if you're a retail

510
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,280
company i mean target was breached for

511
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,440
months gap was breached for

512
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,919
months before they detected it if you

513
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,520
put an account in there with

514
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,640
the initials j visas boom

515
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,720
you are going to know immediately if if

516
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,559
the goal of that account is just

517
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,039
this is just a tripwire because there's

518
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,720
no hacker in their right mind that is

519
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,679
going to see that

520
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,039
and see the possible reward

521
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,640
outweighing the risk that that thing

522
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,360
isn't going to get popped like that

523
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,360
that's funny i wonder how many uh jay

524
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,559
bezos uh

525
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,280
honeypots are out there there's probably

526
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,919
a few of them

527
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,960
there's probably a few but but if you in

528
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,200
like within the corporate infrastructure

529
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,280
of a fortune 500 and stuff

530
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,600
i bet you there's very few relatively

531
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,200
speaking

532
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,280
and you know again how much does that

533
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,640
cost

534
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,160
you know i'm sorry everybody should be

535
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,000
approaching their ciso

536
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and their board you know you got to let

537
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,520
me do this

538
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,320
i mean detection times are still in our

539
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,960
industry

540
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,640
measured in often times in months

541
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,200
and the more time on target an attacker

542
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,919
has the more damage they do

543
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,400
you know it's a reality in our industry

544
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,240
it's not a matter of

545
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
you know if i get hit it's when i get

546
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,520
hit right

547
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,720
and detection time is key in reducing

548
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,039
the amount of damage that they do

549
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,120
yeah and that seems like a pretty simple

550
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,400
proactive way

551
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,120
to you know you you you know when

552
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,679
someone

553
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,080
someone hits that that you know that's a

554
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,840
nefarious actor they're they're after

555
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,400
yeah information you know whatever

556
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,080
whatever and can you talk a little bit

557
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,679
more to that about you know the the

558
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,000
psychology of a cyber criminal like what

559
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,280
are they looking for and it might be

560
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,960
different like whether they're a state

561
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,520
actor

562
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,280
or someone looking for money are there

563
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,760
like different um

564
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,400
i guess archetypes of of these cyber

565
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,360
criminals

566
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,600
oh there are um when i was at the

567
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,679
university we actually had a project

568
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,039
going on when i was at the mortgage

569
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,240
institute to uh to classify and identify

570
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,520
hackers

571
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,440
as part of the compute cluster that we

572
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,799
built there

573
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,880
scanning code looking specifically for

574
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,320
vulnerabilities

575
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,720
um i mean you could clearly tell the

576
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,679
difference between

577
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,919
a state-sponsored military-trained

578
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,360
chinese hacker

579
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,600
because their methodology and techniques

580
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
were so regimented and trained that it

581
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:51,840
was

582
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,520
obvious versus you know a kitty script

583
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,400
or

584
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
you could kind of follow through their

585
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,240
path through the system

586
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,000
looking at the particular techniques

587
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,200
that they use the style of their typing

588
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
um you know and it's almost like the

589
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
signature of a bomb maker

590
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,400
and that you know every hacker

591
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,320
you know unless you get into those

592
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,919
state-sponsored sites where it's a

593
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,840
regimented trained program has their own

594
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,520
unique style

595
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,190
and profile um

596
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,480
[Music]

597
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,200
i mean it it it really is a lot about

598
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,640
psychology we had one

599
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,520
instant recently where you know buddy

600
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,200
called mine up and was wondering you

601
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,320
know well

602
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,559
we got this server and nobody knows what

603
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,520
it is but it's

604
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,039
you know pounding on our database

605
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,880
servers you know you got any ideas

606
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,640
is it one of yours do you know who i can

607
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,000
call

608
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,200
and you know i didn't have any clue of

609
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,320
whose it was

610
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,000
so they immediately start going to

611
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,559
technology well let's track down the

612
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,400
server what port is it plugged on the

613
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,880
switch let's look at the mac table

614
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,799
you know which would have taken them

615
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,559
probably at least half an hour and i

616
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,840
went wait a minute what's the name of

617
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,280
the server

618
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,760
and the server was something something

619
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,360
something dash linux

620
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,720
dot domain name dot com

621
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,240
well okay took me a whole 30 seconds to

622
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,120
go wait a minute

623
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,679
okay so dash dash dash doesn't tie to

624
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,520
like our normal naming standard or any

625
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,600
of our locations

626
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
where do you typically see dash dash

627
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,440
dash well don't you normally see that

628
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,600
when developers annotate their code they

629
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,000
use their initials

630
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
did anybody check if a developer's got a

631
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,320
server out there or if maybe

632
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,559
somebody's doing some pen testing or the

633
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,360
red team's

634
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,320
you know probing you guys and and maybe

635
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,679
that's the initials

636
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,880
of a user and sure enough it turns out

637
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,919
i made some inquiries into you know

638
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,760
the red team that operated for that

639
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,440
company and asked them hey

640
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,960
do you guys happen to have somebody with

641
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,039
the initials blah blah blah

642
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,280
oh why yes we do it's this person oh

643
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,120
well i think i just busted one of their

644
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,600
servers that just caused an outage

645
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,240
from the pen test they were doing you

646
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,000
know where it would have literally taken

647
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,840
them at least half an hour and an hour

648
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,679
and it was middle of the night of waking

649
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,159
people

650
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,250
up you know to track down

651
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,720
[Music]

652
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,960
what this was rather than just thinking

653
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,200
again about the psychology of okay does

654
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,600
this follow the naming standard

655
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,320
no it doesn't what could these three

656
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,080
digits be well somebody's initials

657
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,960
that's interesting yeah and and yeah

658
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,240
it's uh

659
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,760
yeah it's a matter of i guess

660
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,760
recognizing

661
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,600
you you recognize that the pattern it

662
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,039
didn't fit the pattern but like okay

663
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:39,520
what

664
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,919
pattern does that fit and and figuring

665
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,919
out what are the habits of

666
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,039
you know uh some of the pen testers or

667
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,559
developers or whatever like what

668
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,880
what like what could this be and i think

669
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,039
that's that's an interesting way of of

670
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,799
looking at things because i think a lot

671
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,000
of times we

672
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,960
we we kind of like look past like the

673
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,159
obvious thing right

674
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,880
it's oh yeah i mean as geeks too we tend

675
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,200
to

676
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,720
immediately go to how can i

677
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
technologically fix this yeah

678
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,799
how can i get my geek on rather than

679
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,919
thinking about the

680
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,520
why and the potential different avenues

681
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:13,840
of

682
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,200
motive and that the human brain

683
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,080
you know plays into what's happening

684
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,120
around you technologically

685
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,480
yeah um well let's uh switch gears a

686
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,600
little bit and talk

687
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,720
um talk a little bit about you know

688
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,559
everyone working from home and what this

689
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,600
has done i guess for

690
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,120
companies from a cyber security

691
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,960
standpoint and maybe you could talk a

692
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,000
little bit about

693
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,760
the zero trust model that a lot of

694
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,679
companies are

695
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,480
getting on board with and and you know i

696
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:46,799
guess

697
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,000
what what that means for companies

698
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,159
today and in general with covet i mean

699
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,320
obviously you know unless you're living

700
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,400
under a rock on an island without any

701
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,679
kind of media access anywhere

702
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,159
you know there's a large swath of people

703
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,200
compared to

704
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,120
you know six eight months ago that are

705
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,600
working from home

706
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,880
based on the fact that they're working

707
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,880
from home

708
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,080
your network border and perimeter is

709
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,360
is exceptionally porous and mobile

710
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,880
compared to what it used to be

711
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,520
i mean we've always been heading that

712
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,240
way

713
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,200
you know especially with the

714
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,840
proliferation of mobile devices but now

715
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,039
it's accelerated that tenfold and as

716
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,960
such you see a lot of companies rushing

717
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,440
to get to the whole concept of

718
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,559
zero trust private access um you know

719
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,600
security

720
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,200
access edge whatever you want to call it

721
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,159
of where you know your data center is

722
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,279
basically treated as a hardened entity

723
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,200
and even your own people are treated

724
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,799
just like any joe schmo out on the

725
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,480
internet of we don't trust you

726
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,279
any more than than i trust kevin mitnick

727
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,520
sitting outside my

728
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,760
you know sitting parked outside my uh

729
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,600
building or at a coffee shop at

730
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,640
starbucks

731
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,320
you know um

732
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,720
you know we're certainly is an

733
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,039
organization moving that way

734
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,679
in that direction you know as are many

735
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,039
companies because of it

736
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,559
and you know it's gotten a lot of

737
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,480
industries traction and it probably

738
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,919
should

739
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,000
you know why should you treat your users

740
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,120
special

741
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,919
as as opposed to an average internet

742
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:28,480
user

743
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,320
an untrusted user it's it's spurring on

744
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,200
a whole new slew of technologies

745
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,000
um you know as well as tightening down

746
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,960
the perimeter

747
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,559
perimeter like we're trying to get to

748
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,640
the point as as there are many companies

749
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,080
where the only

750
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,840
access in and out of your company is

751
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,480
basically 443 traffic

752
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,320
you know so everything's going to be

753
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,400
encrypted and you're reducing your

754
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,919
attack surface

755
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,799
where especially with porous borders

756
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,559
that uh

757
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,919
we have as people on vpn and through

758
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,039
remote access

759
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,440
it's like critical what do you mean by

760
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,080
porous but what does porous mean

761
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,799
i mean the ports and services people

762
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,400
want to get to byod

763
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,559
they have devices you're connecting with

764
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,799
cloud services the number of ports and

765
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,520
services that are being opened up into

766
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,559
networks

767
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,679
that aren't adopting a zero trust model

768
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:24,240
um

769
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,159
you know especially when you get into

770
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,240
companies that

771
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,840
for whatever reason think it's a good

772
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,919
idea to lift and shift

773
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,520
their legacy stuff into the cloud um

774
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,400
in particular you know with all the

775
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
openings that you're pouring into there

776
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,840
then that's now sitting in someone

777
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,400
else's network

778
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,360
it's you know you just have to take

779
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,840
advantage of a whole different mindset

780
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,919
um in a whole different approach

781
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,000
to security where in the past firewalls

782
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,679
where your your gateway is

783
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,039
sure you know where now your firewall is

784
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:01,440
just

785
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,720
a couple of ports you know

786
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,880
but that's another area really companies

787
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,080
don't do the best

788
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,400
you know and and zero trust is really

789
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,919
pushing them on this and some too

790
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,080
is a lot of companies have very poor

791
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,600
emissions control on the con

792
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,399
concept of mcom especially when it comes

793
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,360
to egress you know which is another huge

794
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,279
detective control of

795
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,960
if you don't know what's going out of

796
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,399
your network

797
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,480
for one you know there's far too many

798
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,440
companies that still

799
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,880
their outbound firewall policy is allow

800
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,399
any any because you know hey they're

801
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,039
inside the network we trust them

802
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,520
it allows them if you are breached you

803
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,240
know i have

804
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,159
free and easy access to establish a

805
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,360
backdoor

806
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,520
to bring in other tools to pivot to

807
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,559
other places

808
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,559
you know which on top of the zero trust

809
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,919
is driving towards

810
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,799
micro segmentation and in network

811
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,880
segmentation in general which

812
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,880
typically has been very poor throughout

813
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
the industry so

814
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,320
i mean it's a learned battle and learned

815
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,240
technologies but you know ironically

816
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,000
some of these concepts and stuff are

817
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,039
stuff that we probably

818
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,399
should have thought about a long time

819
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,960
ago now that's interesting because i

820
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,279
mean

821
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,120
you think about yeah a lot of companies

822
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,559
are moving to

823
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,559
you know a lot of cloud services whether

824
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,159
it's aws azure

825
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,200
like you know and

826
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,600
and from you know what i'm hearing from

827
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,799
you is is

828
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,360
is now you also have people from the

829
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,080
company that

830
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,158
are

831
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,640
they're getting onto those servers

832
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,320
outside of the company right

833
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,679
and so now you know if they are doing it

834
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,240
uh and an unsecured network or something

835
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,399
like that and someone's able to

836
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,840
i don't know capture their like there's

837
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,240
more risk right and so

838
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,600
so that's that's the thing that

839
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,399
that companies so what how do you how

840
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,559
what is the solution to that

841
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,279
i mean the solution to that you know

842
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,320
really is having good

843
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,720
policy and procedure but as well having

844
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,640
a good caspian in place

845
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,039
i mean companies that are doing cloud

846
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,360
just because of the exfiltration

847
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,120
i mean the migration to cloud really has

848
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
moved security from more of a

849
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,000
technological

850
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,360
controls to somewhat technological

851
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,120
controls but those controls are driven

852
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,159
around identity

853
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,799
and access management configuration

854
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,120
management and drift control

855
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,960
because the biggest challenge in the

856
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,480
cloud is if you really want to take

857
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,679
advantage of it

858
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,360
you know you're using servers whose

859
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,279
lifetime is you know

860
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,039
hours days minutes in some cases

861
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,760
that you have to know first off when

862
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,679
that system is built

863
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,159
that it was built on a secure code base

864
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,760
that doesn't have any holes

865
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,200
that you know while it does live nothing

866
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,559
changed to open up a vulnerability

867
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,360
and that it existed at all you know

868
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,840
which is probably the biggest challenge

869
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,919
of especially for companies that have

870
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,799
poor cmdb and asset management programs

871
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,080
um

872
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,360
yeah i mean it changes the whole

873
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,480
paradigm of things and you know you

874
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,799
you asked how we're tackling that like i

875
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,440
said in particular

876
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,919
we're implementing caspi so that you

877
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:22,880
know users

878
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,799
should only be allowed to go to

879
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,559
approve tenants for the organization

880
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,840
because i think that's probably one of

881
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,360
the biggest fears is like you know i

882
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,200
have my own

883
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,360
m365 tenant that hosts my domain

884
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,679
yeah you know i could get on the if i

885
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,919
was nefarious i could get onto

886
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,440
you know my corporate one and i could

887
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,279
exfiltrate data right out to my own

888
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,600
domain

889
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,760
yeah but i think some of that goes to

890
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,360
psychology again too and knowing who

891
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,080
your

892
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,000
attacker is everybody has different

893
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,559
factors you know a construction company

894
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,080
is going to be targeted by a very

895
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,760
different hacker than as opposed to

896
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,799
somebody who's hitting

897
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,720
you know a large retailer or a bank

898
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,120
so you you got to know what your real

899
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,000
risk is and

900
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,039
who is likely to target you you know and

901
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,559
what their motivation to target you

902
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,320
would be

903
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,960
yeah interesting interesting and it was

904
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,480
i mean i guess like aside from money

905
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,440
like what are the

906
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,760
uh what are the other motivations well

907
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,559
some of it

908
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,080
you know are just for fun kids

909
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,559
are kids that's true you know and people

910
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,120
are people

911
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,840
some do it for fun some do it to

912
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,480
embarrass

913
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,000
you know and money can take different

914
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,320
forms you know if you're going for

915
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,919
identity theft you're going to want to

916
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,519
hit a big

917
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,080
company like transunion you know we have

918
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,880
a ton of identity information

919
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,799
if you're going to go after money you're

920
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,399
probably going to hit a big retailer or

921
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,600
somebody with lots of credit card

922
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,880
information

923
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,360
um if if you're going after intellectual

924
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,880
property

925
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,000
usually you're either going to be

926
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,799
somebody who's paid by another company

927
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,720
or you're gonna be a state sponsored

928
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,919
level uh

929
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,679
attacker trying to get intellectual

930
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,200
property like a good example is with

931
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,080
covet i mean

932
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,799
all of the major pharmaceutical

933
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,720
companies that are doing any research on

934
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,399
coven vaccines

935
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,200
are just being hammered on now by uh

936
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,159
state level

937
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,440
programs from from various nefarious

938
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,320
countries

939
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,919
huh i wouldn't i wouldn't have thought

940
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,360
of that but i guess yeah that makes

941
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,159
sense

942
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,360
huh oh yeah i mean when one of the dod

943
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,279
contractors i was working for

944
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,480
good example of this was uh developed a

945
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,600
landing gear on

946
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,480
you remember years back there was a

947
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,399
reconnaissance plane that

948
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,640
had a mechanical problem and had to make

949
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,960
an emergency landing in uh

950
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,720
china i don't think i remember that one

951
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,000
particularly

952
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,120
well there was one and the defense

953
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,799
contractor that i was working for it

954
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,399
actually designed the landing gear on

955
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,360
the plane

956
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,640
okay so i mean completely obscure part

957
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,640
of the plane that has nothing to do with

958
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,240
any of the surveillance gear and stuff

959
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,960
on it

960
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,840
but the number of attacks coming into us

961
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,919
from china went up by about a thousand

962
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:08,840
percent

963
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,480
wow while that was going on

964
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,720
huh interesting wow

965
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,080
wow uh yeah i learned a lot here dan i

966
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,279
appreciate you uh telling teaching me a

967
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,120
a lot about

968
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,080
your path and learning things that that

969
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,519
you learned along the way

970
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,000
and learning about these uh the

971
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,200
psychology i guess

972
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,279
both from like you know a pen testing

973
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,880
side and then from the cyber

974
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,880
security the cyber criminal side it's

975
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,120
been it's been interesting to

976
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,559
to talk to you um do you have any

977
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,679
uh plugs that you

978
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:48,880
or anything you want to share with

979
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,480
anyone any advice anything like that

i mean one i'm gonna say you know if

981
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,679
you're interested and want to learn more

982
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:56,240
about me

983
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,240
just go to my linkedin page and start up

984
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,279
a conversation

985
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,840
you know i'm always i'm very passionate

986
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,919
about this industry you know

987
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,240
and like i said i'm a big geek you know

988
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,000
right now i manage teams all over the

989
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,960
place and

990
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,119
my meeting schedule is just crazy but at

991
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,399
the same time

992
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,480
i love technology so much to the point i

993
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,879
have a 42u rack in my house

994
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,879
running a small openstack cloud with

995
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,879
various linux versions i have an oculus

996
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,560
rift

997
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,679
i mean i love technology always will and

998
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,399
i'm always

999
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,599
you know even as i focus more on

1000
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,239
management

1001
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,159
aspects of cyber security i'm always

1002
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,079
gonna love the technology

1003
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,560
and be involved in it you know i teach

1004
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,800
high school robotics kids

1005
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,320
to high school students as part of the

1006
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,159
us first program

1007
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,159
you know there's a huge talent shortage

1008
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,320
right now if your kids are not

1009
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,639
you know focusing on some of the stem

1010
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,679
stuff and

1011
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,560
and don't have an interest in technology

1012
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,280
and
