1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:03,439
matt

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,480
welcome back to the podcast hey kyle

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,839
good to be back

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,880
um last time you're on the podcast you

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,679
gave us kind of a rundown of uh

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,239
cryptocurrency and hot wallets uh

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,359
and and you worked at coinbase then and

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,439
uh now you're working for a different

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,640
exchange uh

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,840
gemini and i i

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,720
recently uh started reading the book um

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,479
bitcoin billionaires which is about the

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,880
winklevoss twins who are the

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,399
the owners of gemini and

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,000
it was interesting reading about like

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,239
the early days in in bitcoin

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,200
i i recently got into it after our

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,520
conversation is when i first got a

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,640
little taste of

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,480
of bitcoin and then more uh in in 2020

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,120
i started to get more into uh

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,039
cryptocurrencies and stuff but

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,719
reading about the early days like when

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,640
the winklevoss twins got a hold of it

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,399
and they're like oh this is gonna be

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,799
huge and i think it was back in like

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,040
maybe 2012 i want to say

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,479
uh they were trying to get large sums of

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,159
of bitcoin i think it wound up being

30
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,600
like a total of 11 million dollars

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,880
and they had to go through uh this

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,759
exchange

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,320
that was called mount gox and mount gox

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,680
was run by

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,080
uh this guy out of japan and it was

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,479
really complicated to have to

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,680
get it and and there was issues with you

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,040
know latency and it was it was hard to

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,880
it was hard to acquire bitcoins back

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,479
then and um

41
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,479
so i was wondering if maybe we could

42
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,920
talk a little bit about that in the

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,720
context

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,000
of you know where where we were then

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,280
and where we came uh and uh

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,960
just talk maybe a little bit about

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,399
bitcoin and you know what it's

48
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,200
what the real innovation there was and

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,680
and how far we've come over these years

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,479
yeah big question i guess yeah no it's i

51
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,159
mean it's timely you know we're in

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,600
all-time highs lately

53
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,599
and um yeah today

54
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,040
is 55 000 today i mean and we hit a one

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,560
trillion dollar market cap

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,120
yeah and it's february 19th today for

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,319
those who are watching this in the

58
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:20,720
future

59
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,239
february 19th 2021 so right

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,959
uh who knows what it'll be by then by

61
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,360
the time

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,640
anyone listens to it so like uh yeah

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,440
i mean back then when you were buying

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,720
from mount cox you were

65
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,480
literally wiring money to a foreign

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,920
entity trusting that it ended up there

67
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,080
correctly and i mean mount gox's

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
magic the gathering online exchange is

69
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,599
what it originally

70
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,920
was for so like this guy was selling

71
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,879
magic cards

72
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,480
and he pivoted into bitcoin and

73
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
you know it's it's like knowing what i

74
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,080
know about the what you need to do to

75
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,599
secure that stuff it's it's not

76
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,959
surprising you got hacked

77
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,159
and i remember back then

78
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,280
uh i was i was an engineer and working

79
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,920
at this

80
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,159
i i was at a party one time and

81
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,760
someone's like oh we want to build this

82
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,720
bitcoin thing

83
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,640
for you know cross cross border payments

84
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,680
and i looked and it was like 115 each

85
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,159
then and i was like oh it's over like

86
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,360
why would i join a

87
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,920
bitcoin company when it's already 115

88
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,799
like

89
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,319
because i didn't get it and i think this

90
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,480
is like what what happens for a lot of

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,000
people when they start getting into

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,040
crypto

93
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,920
is they start with seeing the price and

94
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,480
like they see price go up price go down

95
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,400
and and that's about the extent of their

96
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,879
familiarity with the technology

97
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,760
and if that's as far as your involvement

98
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,599
goes or your understanding goes

99
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,799
it can seem completely erratic

100
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,040
for why people would put value in this

101
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,360
thing why would go up or down

102
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,519
and it just seems like uh you know play

103
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,720
money

104
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,159
but when you start getting into

105
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,439
kind of why bitcoin was made and

106
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,879
what benefits it provides you start to

107
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,840
kind of understand

108
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,400
how this could end up being so valuable

109
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,120
where

110
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,560
you have a digital currency that is not

111
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,600
facilitated by any one organization it

112
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,800
is

113
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,919
censorship resistant

114
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,080
these are like terms that are used a lot

115
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,759
in the industry but like

116
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,240
basically meaning no one can stop you

117
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,360
from using it

118
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,400
if you have access to the internet

119
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,520
you can use this like piece of data to

120
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,040
hold value

121
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,120
and that's incredibly powerful because

122
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,400
there's

123
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,560
all sorts of organizations that control

124
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,040
the access to capital there's nations

125
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,199
that don't have access to capital

126
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,840
there's you know people that take

127
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
fees uh and

128
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,800
exploit these transactions for their own

129
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,680
profit

130
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,919
when it's really just as simple as a

131
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,039
transaction online

132
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,360
and like it doesn't need to involve all

133
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,800
these middlemen it doesn't even involve

134
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,720
these parties that want to decide

135
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,160
whether or not you can have that money

136
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,919
or transact that money

137
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,520
you can just work online and like

138
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,600
when you start to get into how that

139
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
actually happens

140
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,720
uh i started getting that in like 2015

141
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,600
2016

142
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,080
and it started to kind of click for me

143
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,160
then that's when you really start to

144
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,840
understand how this is valuable because

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,639
it makes you want to get involved

146
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,120
because you realize the impact can have

147
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,120
and and here we are now in 2020 where

148
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,600
there is a whole you know landscape of

149
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,880
different currencies

150
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,440
that accomplish different things for

151
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,560
different reasons

152
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,120
and there's a huge amount of value in it

153
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,960
you know i think there's 1.6 trillion

154
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,919
total market cap in the entire industry

155
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,759
and you know a trillion of that is just

156
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,600
bitcoin alone so i think like

157
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
i i expect it'll grow much more than

158
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,800
that you know it's

159
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,240
it's like if you compare the utility and

160
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,000
benefit of the cryptocurrency

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,039
industry today it's

162
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,800
it's providing more valuable than gold

163
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,479
is and gold is

164
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,280
a larger market cap so i i expect

165
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,360
cryptocurrency to continue growing

166
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,759
and what gives bitcoin it's its value

167
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,360
yeah it's a good question uh and that's

168
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,960
like the most common question

169
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,360
i think like people often say scarcity

170
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,880
where people often say

171
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,600
um that it's you know provides some

172
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,199
utility

173
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,199
and i mean i don't know

174
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,840
i think that like why humans value

175
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,639
something

176
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,080
or find value in it can't really be

177
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,919
reduced down to one answer

178
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,599
i think that it it serves

179
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,199
a purpose to you know

180
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,280
especially in our society today it

181
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,599
serves a purpose to store value

182
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,800
in a digital age it serves its purpose

183
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,919
to

184
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,120
be easily transacted that you don't have

185
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,720
to wait two to three days for your bank

186
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,599
to send a

187
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,560
electronic payment uh it even serves a

188
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,440
purpose to like

189
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,520
hedge against you know

190
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,160
government states that you don't really

191
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,560
like the direction that

192
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,560
you know an economy is going where the

193
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,080
inflation is going or whatever it might

194
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,639
be

195
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,360
depending on your nation uh even if it's

196
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,960
you know even if it's just storing value

197
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,400
in that environment that can be

198
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,919
incredibly valuable to you and can

199
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,759
actually be more valuable than the fiat

200
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,800
currency that you get from your

201
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,080
government

202
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,960
so you know if we don't really question

203
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,160
what gives

204
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,280
a green back its value

205
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,479
it's the same thing as what gives

206
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,240
bitcoin it's value it's it's kind of the

207
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,120
story behind

208
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,160
it right like it's it's been you know i

209
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,479
think

210
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,960
satoshi nakamoto came out with a white

211
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,599
paper

212
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,879
saying like here's a currency

213
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,120
that you know like you said it's

214
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,479
censorship resistant

215
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,360
you don't need a a government to say

216
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,919
this is

217
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,080
this is real it's backed by math

218
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
essentially so it's the

219
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,360
the math equations that you know give it

220
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,879
it's scarce like you said there's only

221
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,120
going to be 21 million ever

222
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,160
um and so

223
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,759
and i think that story has kind of

224
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,279
proven itself over time

225
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,679
too you know like it's it's it's been

226
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,360
tried like governments have tried to

227
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,159
quash it and

228
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,799
just you can't it's been i don't have

229
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,599
heard it called

230
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,800
the uh the sewer rat of the

231
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,480
of of the cryptocurrency or blockchain

232
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,800
space because it's just been able to

233
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,160
survive

234
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,959
regardless of whatever happens and you

235
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,560
know the more

236
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,920
the more you know uncertainty or

237
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,240
you know the more fun that's that's shed

238
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,120
on it the more

239
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,680
it just keeps pumping up you know and so

240
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,160
it's

241
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,519
it's kind of that like what you said

242
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,440
it's you know we don't really know it

243
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,240
gives he makes people value stuff but

244
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,040
it's that

245
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
kind of the narrative the story around

246
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,480
it if bitcoin

247
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,240
if it turned out you could hack bitcoin

248
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,000
or you could spend more than

249
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,720
the same bitcoin over and over again and

250
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,680
and you could

251
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,279
fudge the system that would probably

252
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,040
make it go down significantly right

253
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,800
people would lose their faith in it

254
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,360
so but that i mean that hasn't happened

255
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,279
it's not likely to happen it seems like

256
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,720
it's been able to be proven

257
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,959
pretty well to guess from you know it

258
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,640
was a few cents when it first came out

259
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,519
and it's like

260
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,320
it's like you said over 50k now which is

261
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,360
insane

262
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,760
um it's funny yeah my my sister just

263
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,920
texted me today and she's like is

264
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,360
is now a good time to get into crypto

265
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,240
i'm like i have no idea i don't know

266
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,680
but um it's like uh the best time to

267
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,519
plant a tree right like the best time

268
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,040
was 20 years ago

269
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,440
the second best time is now yeah yeah

270
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,640
maybe that's what i should have told her

271
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,160
i'm like i'm like probably

272
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,079
a question mark i i don't know i don't

273
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,279
know what's going to happen tomorrow i

274
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,560
don't want to tell you that i mean

275
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,000
definitely don't put your life savings

276
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,040
into it but

277
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,120
yeah right anyway uh so

278
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,680
yeah i think yeah that's uh i think

279
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,399
bitcoin

280
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,240
is and the more i get into it more i

281
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,680
read about it and learn about it i can

282
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,200
you know kind of caught the bug and

283
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,959
just realized that you know this is a

284
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,880
really interesting thing you know like

285
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,600
this is

286
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,760
uh in an age where um

287
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,360
like our lives are digital now right

288
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,519
like we have like online personalities

289
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,519
it's like this is our online money like

290
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,640
our lives have largely moved over to

291
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,720
the internet and even like dollars you

292
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,880
you you know trade like you get paid

293
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,680
from your

294
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,760
employer it's usually put right into

295
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,720
your bank account

296
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,800
you don't even see the actual dollar so

297
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
it's like

298
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,040
especially during the pandemic like i

299
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,720
i have a hard time remembering the last

300
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,680
time i used actual physical cash

301
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,880
you know maybe maybe i like paid a

302
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,560
toll or something i don't remember but

303
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,880
like it's only a handful of times that

304
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,399
i've used cash in the past

305
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,920
year yeah yeah so it's

306
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,320
um so yeah it's it like you said it's

307
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,480
proven to be super valuable

308
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,760
um one of the things that you know as i

309
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,279
started to research and get into this

310
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,680
thing uh i started to learn about it was

311
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,880
you know um

312
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,399
bitcoin you can only really do three

313
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,040
things you can send it you can

314
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,200
receive it and you can hold it you can't

315
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,240
do anything

316
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,600
other than that um

317
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,800
but what i've learned is ethereum's come

318
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,720
along and it's kind of been like this

319
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,240
new project where

320
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,680
now not only can you you know do those

321
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,480
things

322
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,200
uh but now you can have smart contracts

323
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
we can put some logic in it so if this

324
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,360
thing happens then this thing can happen

325
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,079
and there's a whole ecosystem of these

326
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,720
different

327
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,680
uh smart contracts that can interact

328
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,279
with each other they're all open source

329
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,240
so you can

330
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,320
have one contract interact with another

331
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,839
contract and

332
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,399
um it's really cool because now you can

333
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,160
do things which called like

334
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,760
decentralized finance

335
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,279
uh which is um you know taking what you

336
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,279
normally do with a centralized

337
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,880
uh bank or centralized exchange

338
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,959
we could talk about centralized and

339
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,000
decentralized

340
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,560
uh but the thing i like about d5 is is

341
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,279
now

342
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,600
you know if i take uh let's say i had

343
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,880
ten thousand dollars and i want to

344
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,240
deposit into my bank

345
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
the bank's gonna turn around and loan

346
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,079
out 9 000 of that dollar so they only

347
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,920
have to keep 10 percent of what they

348
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,800
have and then they are an interest on

349
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,519
that so they're

350
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,480
earning interest on your money so what

351
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,760
the beauty of

352
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
uh i think what the d5 space and what

353
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,160
ethereum has done is now you can take

354
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,360
your dollars and you can um you can loan

355
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,160
it out you can

356
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,959
you can loan it out you can borrow money

357
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,320
you can

358
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,399
uh you can stake your money you can

359
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,079
yield farming we can get into some of

360
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,000
those things uh in a bit here but like

361
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,360
there's a lot of cool things you can do

362
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,560
and there's more things that people are

363
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,399
coming out with every day

364
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,880
um and so um

365
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,320
yeah i was just maybe you could just

366
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,000
talk a little bit about the

367
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,320
uh what what's the ecosystem like today

368
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,600
um

369
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,200
what what do you see like

370
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,320
what do you think about that yeah so

371
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,800
uh we talk a lot about utility in the

372
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,360
industry

373
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,519
like we talk about you know what what

374
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,440
can this token do

375
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,120
that is uniquely beneficial

376
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,160
for its its holder and

377
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,120
like you said crypto earlier on like

378
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,079
just bitcoin

379
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,560
a great store of value that's utility

380
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,680
case

381
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,959
uh payments send and receive like that's

382
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,120
that's great because even with payments

383
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,000
um like

384
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,040
western union takes like 11

385
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
of remittances from you know

386
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,720
cross-border payments

387
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,000
and you can pay you know a dollar

388
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,720
to send crypto across borders and that

389
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,000
means that the people get to keep more

390
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,519
of that money so payments was a great

391
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,480
improvement

392
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,079
uh that was one of the first most

393
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,079
obvious use cases

394
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,320
of cryptocurrency then uh in 2017 we saw

395
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,079
icos

396
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,560
and this was raising capital you said i

397
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,920
have an idea

398
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,440
i want you to pay me for it and

399
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,760
uh when it goes really well we'll all

400
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,920
you know do well together

401
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,560
and raising capital was another utility

402
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,760
case that drove

403
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,160
a lot of adoption in crypto and that was

404
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,240
i think when it got on a lot of people's

405
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,760
radar for the first time uh

406
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,120
after 2017 there wasn't a whole lot of

407
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,639
new utilities showing up like there were

408
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,560
a few different ideas

409
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,880
but it wasn't until d5 where you started

410
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,399
to see

411
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,000
uh some real traction around

412
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,880
this being a good use case for utility

413
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,320
that

414
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,720
in the same way that payments disrupted

415
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,600
moneygram and western union icos

416
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,000
disrupted venture capital

417
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,720
now we're seeing traditional finance

418
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,959
financial services being disrupted by

419
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,079
crypto and that looks like uh like you

420
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,839
said if i go and put my money in my

421
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,199
savings account

422
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,240
i'm essentially allowing that bank

423
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,959
to go make money on my money and they'll

424
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:33,440
give me

425
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,759
a small portion of that well we don't

426
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,920
need the bank to do that now

427
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,279
and we can create a system which is

428
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,920
what defy is that you put the money in

429
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,399
and you get a certain percentage yield

430
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,360
on on that

431
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,639
money that you put into the system and

432
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,240
the protocol at the protocol level

433
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,160
will be willing to loan that

434
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,880
cryptocurrency out to another individual

435
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,720
that is willing to pay interest for that

436
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,800
loan and this is

437
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,199
you know trustless parties you don't

438
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,880
know the person that's taking the loan

439
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,800
the loan recipient doesn't know who's

440
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,240
providing the liquidity

441
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,560
we don't need to because everything is

442
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,639
bound to the blockchain

443
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,680
and in order to make sure that my money

444
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
is safe when i put liquidity in

445
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,839
the protocol requires over

446
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,440
collateralization

447
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,680
so if the if the loan recipient

448
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,959
wants to take out as an example

449
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,680
uh one ethereum loan in need one

450
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,480
ethereum

451
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,279
they might have to put in 1.5 times the

452
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,639
value

453
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,839
of collateral to get access to that

454
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,839
and so then you know people are saying

455
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,959
oh if i have

456
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,519
1.5 times collateral why do i take out

457
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,040
the loan

458
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,920
and this is mainly because like the one

459
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,720
thing you get

460
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,199
from having a central organization is

461
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,800
someone to bear the risk

462
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,720
so a bank bears the risk if the loan

463
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,639
defaults but we don't have anyone to

464
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,920
bear that risk we're not willing to say

465
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,160
the liquidity provider bears that risk

466
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,679
so um for me say that i need to

467
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,959
pay someone a thousand dollars i have

468
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,319
a thousand dollars or two thousand

469
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,240
dollars worth of eth

470
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,400
but i don't want to sell it to be to get

471
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,919
access that capital

472
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,439
so i can put that as collateral into

473
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,679
d5 i can get a one thousand dollar

474
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,160
uh die token loan i can sell that give

475
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,919
the money to the person that i owe

476
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,960
a thousand dollars to and then down the

477
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,000
line when i get the

478
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,760
my money back i can give back the

479
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,360
thousand dollars pay a little interest

480
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,039
and get my collateral back

481
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,360
and like that is just strictly access to

482
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,320
money in

483
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,480
the same way that you'd get a loan from

484
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,840
a bank

485
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,720
but i can do that for my phone like i

486
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,520
can just

487
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
open an app on my phone press a few

488
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,960
buttons

489
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,679
and within an hour like after

490
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,520
transactions settle and stuff

491
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,480
i could have that money and in order to

492
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,280
go through that same process with a bank

493
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,120
i don't know how long it takes it takes

494
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,320
a long time and

495
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,840
and like last time i took out a loan at

496
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,080
the bank i had a big stack of papers to

497
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,120
sign

498
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,200
half of it i didn't understand the

499
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,400
wording of it

500
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,039
and i and i don't know like i paid a

501
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,960
higher rate from a bank

502
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,760
it just seems like there's so much more

503
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,520
efficiencies gained

504
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,480
by removing that middleman and having

505
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,080
the person that

506
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,919
wants to get the money get it directly

507
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,200
from the source

508
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,280
of the person providing it and you get

509
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,799
better margins

510
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,600
you get better rates and overall i think

511
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,160
it's

512
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,679
it's the type of thing that when you see

513
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,200
it work

514
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,160
it's an obvious evolution of financial

515
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,600
services because

516
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,360
it is more efficient and if something

517
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,960
can be more efficient

518
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,400
i think that uh it'll win in the end

519
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,080
wow there's so many directions i want to

520
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,840
go there um

521
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,200
maybe let's talk about this so you

522
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,840
mentioned dye and so dye is kind of the

523
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,320
decentralized stable coin

524
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,480
um and you talk about that you talked

525
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,440
about that that

526
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,480
uh that whole process

527
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,200
just kind of in a in in general like

528
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
what what types of protocols out there

529
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,720
are there any particular protocols out

530
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,240
there that you think are doing a good

531
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,960
job at this

532
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,120
um you know if you talk maybe a little

533
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,880
bit about you know one of the protocols

534
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,280
and

535
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,840
maybe explain dye a little bit too yeah

536
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,480
you bet

537
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,600
so we'll start with kind of what the

538
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,280
base d5 protocols are um and there's

539
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,679
a whole bunch up there but you'll you

540
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,280
know some of the higher

541
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,000
profile ones are like avi or uniswap

542
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,200
um those those are the types of uh

543
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,840
platforms where you have pools of

544
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,480
liquidity that

545
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,280
can be borrowed or

546
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,440
can be used to support a dex

547
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,600
so if you say like i have one currency i

548
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
want to convert it to another currency

549
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,440
it will be able to calculate the current

550
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,280
market price for that

551
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,000
and will have liquidity stores available

552
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,559
to

553
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,799
be the counterparty for whatever you're

554
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,080
trading

555
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,799
and this is kind of like the newer era

556
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,080
of dexes like the older era of dexes

557
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,919
would um be more of like a bulletin

558
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,600
board system where like someone would

559
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,720
say like

560
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,559
uh decentralized exchange right yeah

561
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,960
right so this is like the idea of

562
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,600
trading

563
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,440
you know like i have one thing i want to

564
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,120
get another thing

565
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,520
and uh the older dexes would be

566
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,039
like a bulletin board system where you'd

567
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,360
say i have one eath and i want this much

568
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,080
for it

569
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,880
and someone could take that offer and

570
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,520
and

571
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,960
there wouldn't be any kind of matching

572
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,880
system under the hood like

573
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,720
you couldn't have two parties that just

574
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,240
said i'm willing to sell this i'm

575
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,880
willing to buy

576
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,919
this and match uh it was more of like

577
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,600
one-off bid and offer take and give

578
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,640
but now because of the developments

579
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,159
largely by uniswap earlier last year

580
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,200
um they're able to calculate kind of

581
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,919
guarantee

582
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,720
a market rate for the price based on

583
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,240
their liquidity

584
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,000
so if you have a lot of

585
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,520
ethereum and you want to trade for die

586
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,480
the price of one converting to the other

587
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,840
will shift as the supply changes and the

588
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,320
thinking

589
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,600
is behind it and it pans out to work uh

590
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,640
that if the price gets too far off one

591
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,760
way or the other

592
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,919
someone will put more liquidity in to

593
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,280
earn a better yield

594
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,840
to replace back where the price should

595
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,600
be at the market rate on like

596
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,039
centralized exchanges and stuff like

597
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,120
that and this is called a bonding curve

598
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,919
that the price will fluctuate based on

599
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,320
the supply of the system

600
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,440
and and it what happens is

601
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,600
you financially incentivize the

602
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,960
participants

603
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,120
to provide more liquidity when needed

604
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,559
because they'll get a better yield on

605
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,679
that

606
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,799
and to capitalize on a good deal

607
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,120
if there's oversupply of one currency

608
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,720
people will buy it up because it's

609
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,360
cheaper than

610
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,679
the market rate and this just kind of

611
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,200
normalizes the price into what the

612
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,559
market rate should be

613
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,320
and this is all done without like a

614
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,640
centralized exchange overseeing those

615
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,520
order books

616
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,720
and it's one of the reasons why d5 was

617
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,400
able to get so much traction last year

618
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,120
because

619
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,200
it's a much better experience to have

620
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,039
that matching engine

621
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,559
and automated market makers uh

622
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,440
to be able to trade much more easily

623
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,320
than you could

624
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,520
on the previous iteration of d5 oh man

625
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,960
so many directions i want to go again

626
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,159
but let's all right let's stay on the

627
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,440
uni swap then so

628
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,120
yeah i mean i would think of uniswap and

629
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,360
ave to be kind of different a little bit

630
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:55,840
different

631
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,159
um different they have a little bit

632
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,000
different functionalities where like ave

633
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,600
is like you want to

634
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,200
borrow or you either want to borrow or

635
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,080
loan

636
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,200
you know tokens versus

637
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,760
unit swap i look at more of uh you want

638
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,559
to

639
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,400
i guess i guess it is kind of the same

640
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,760
but it it

641
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,360
to me in my mind it has a different

642
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,039
function because i think of i think of

643
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,080
like

644
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,720
i think of unit swap as like a

645
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,280
decentralized

646
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,200
coinbase or gemini for example a

647
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
decentralized exchange in that way i

648
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,480
guess ave

649
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,000
maybe because there's a lot more coins

650
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,919
on it and a lot more tokens rather

651
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,039
um versus ave has like a limited amount

652
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:35,520
but

653
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,559
you can you can loan you can loan and

654
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,600
borrow and stuff like that yeah so

655
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,840
like one of the things on one of the

656
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,360
reasons why d5

657
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,919
has worked as well as it has is because

658
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:48,799
everything

659
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,320
within e5 the d5 follows the erc20

660
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,679
standard

661
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,480
and so like if you create a new token

662
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:56,880
and

663
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,440
you talk about erc20 that inside yeah

664
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,039
yeah so erc20

665
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,320
uh it's it's like a abbreviation for

666
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,799
ethereum request for comments and it was

667
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,320
the 20th one of those

668
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,120
uh requests and so on github where

669
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,600
ethereum code is written and stored

670
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
uh there's like a way to raise new

671
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,960
issues and say i want to talk about this

672
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,799
thing i want to talk about this thing

673
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,159
and way back in 2017

674
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,520
i think early 2017 uh someone said hey

675
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,880
i want to like define a standard

676
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,840
for a token and because they wanted to

677
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,799
be able to have

678
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,039
a currency within one ethereum smart

679
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,240
contract

680
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,960
so if you have ethereum as a network an

681
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,799
ethereum is based currency for that

682
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,520
at any one address you have a smart

683
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
contract that has all the different

684
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,000
programming to make the thing do it's

685
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,200
supposed to do

686
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,360
and so when you use ave or you use the

687
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,559
unit swap

688
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,480
all of that functionality under the hood

689
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,240
is all inside

690
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,799
one smart contract or it might be a

691
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,400
handful of smart contracts that it

692
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,320
branches out to

693
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,480
and within that anytime you have a token

694
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,080
that's in d5

695
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,360
every one of them follows this erc20

696
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,120
standard that they established back in

697
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,919
2017

698
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,120
and that's basically like send receive

699
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,120
mint burn uh check my balance

700
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,760
you know stuff like that like basic

701
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,200
rudimentary

702
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,480
token handling and

703
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,559
because they all fit the same standard

704
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,559
all of them are erc20s

705
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,400
you can just add another one because

706
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,840
it's the same thing it just has a

707
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,799
different ticker

708
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,880
a little different configuration but for

709
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,919
the most part

710
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,120
it's all the same thing and and then

711
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,960
that's

712
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,080
the same kind of ideology around d5 that

713
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,159
you can piece these things together

714
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,159
because they're all just smart contracts

715
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,039
like lego pieces exactly they call these

716
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,159
like money legos

717
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,080
where you can just piece them together

718
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,919
and you start to combine things and and

719
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,279
to your question about the different d5

720
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,240
protocols

721
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,440
there's like wire and finance that

722
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,640
they route to different d5 platforms and

723
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:08,960
it's

724
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,600
it's like automated routing to the best

725
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,000
price

726
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and the best rate and stuff like that

727
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,760
and that's able to do that because it

728
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,120
can just interact with different smart

729
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,480
contracts

730
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,679
so you know it's it's like yeah some

731
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,279
protocols might have a few more assets

732
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,480
than others

733
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,200
but like as an example i wrote the token

734
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,120
list for uniswap for gemini

735
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,679
and it's the default list on there now

736
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,799
and it's just a list of

737
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,320
the tokens that we think are really good

738
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,000
but you can make your own

739
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,559
and you can have your you can make your

740
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,840
own token and you can trade it on

741
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,279
unisoft if you want

742
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,320
if there's liquidity and that's cool

743
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,799
you know it's like uh it's it's very

744
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,080
accessible

745
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,320
and uh i think it's it's like one of the

746
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,120
reasons why

747
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,640
you know because it's so open and

748
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,039
everything is like the same standard

749
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,240
it's made uh building in d5

750
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,760
you know really successful over the past

751
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,360
year yeah that's what i really like

752
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,279
about uniswap is like i mean there's

753
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,240
thousands of coins on there um but i

754
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
guess some of the bad side is is like

755
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,760
you know you have people that are

756
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,279
putting these scams on there and then

757
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:11,760
they'll

758
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,159
they'll take the money and run or

759
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,559
they'll pretend they'll like make like a

760
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,080
a contract that looks like another

761
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,559
contract it looks like another coin and

762
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,080
uh if you don't get on the right

763
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,919
contract then you can you know you can

764
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,039
be screwed so

765
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,279
it's always good to check on that you

766
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,440
know um

767
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,360
like like you said like gemini's got the

768
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,399
list of of the of

769
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,919
the you know the good tokens make sure

770
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,360
you find the right contract for it

771
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,080
before you

772
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,240
before you trade any of those things and

773
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,640
like like coin gecko a lot to

774
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,000
you know figure out where uh

775
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,600
where these different con the right

776
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,200
contracts are that's why i really like

777
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,840
coin geckos yeah use that and ether scan

778
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,600
is good for that too yeah either scan

779
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,799
yeah yeah definitely um

780
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,720
i guess so that's one of the downsides i

781
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,080
guess another one is

782
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,159
uh if there's a lot of and now we're

783
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,600
seeing a lot of people get into this

784
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,480
space

785
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,440
um and it really bogs down the system so

786
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,279
it'll take a long time for transactions

787
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,080
to happen

788
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,320
there's also these gas fees and gas fees

789
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,480
have been just astronomical so sometimes

790
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,279
it'll take

791
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,080
you know 50 to 100 just to make a

792
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,159
transaction happen in d5

793
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,000
um and so i'm wondering if you could

794
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,320
talk a little bit about

795
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,799
what are kind of some of the solutions

796
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:27,679
to this problem

797
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,840
i know we talked a little bit you know

798
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,120
prior about

799
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,480
uh layer two uh things coming out

800
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,480
um i know that ethereum ethereum twos

801
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,600
looking at some sharding stuff um so i

802
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,240
don't know maybe

803
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,960
talk just a little bit about um what are

804
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,399
kind of some of the solutions to the

805
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,600
system getting bogged down

806
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,320
gas prices uh what's what's the future

807
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,919
holding for us

808
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,799
yeah for sure um it's it's like top of

809
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,320
mind for everybody that's

810
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,159
been working in it um the this it's real

811
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,399
scaling issues that it's a good problem

812
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,760
to have you know we

813
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,120
experienced the same problems with

814
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,279
bitcoin in 2017

815
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,840
and um like cryptokitties was one of the

816
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,120
first things to really test

817
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,600
the ethereum network but we're way past

818
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,880
that now

819
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,440
and so last december

820
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,840
the beacon chain for eth2 launched and

821
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,720
it was a big big milestone for eth2 they

822
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,840
had been working on that for literally

823
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,960
years

824
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,840
and it's basically the first kind of

825
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,279
flag in the ground

826
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,279
to get a proof-of-stake

827
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,559
network running that can

828
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,360
be compatible with the existing ethereum

829
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,559
network

830
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,159
and there's some caveats to that but

831
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,320
basically it's the first step towards

832
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,360
launching eth2

833
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,000
and what they're going to do as over the

834
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,559
next two years or so

835
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,080
they are going to roll out next

836
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,200
milestones in that process to be able to

837
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,679
launch different shards on the eth2

838
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,960
network

839
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,399
so a shard uh like sharding in general

840
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,440
on network

841
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,840
is basically the idea that you have

842
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,559
several

843
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,600
smaller networks that are not processing

844
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,440
everything ethereum is doing

845
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,799
but it's processing the stuff that's

846
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,799
relevant to you

847
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,720
and if there is something that you try

848
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,720
to send to that's outside of your little

849
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,960
cluster it knows how to route it

850
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,799
correctly and knows how to settle it

851
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,679
correctly

852
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,760
and knows how to finalize it in a way

853
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,279
that is safe

854
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,360
that it doesn't offer double spends does

855
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,279
not work for reversals

856
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,480
and it can do that in a in a you know

857
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,840
segregated network

858
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,559
or partition network way and um

859
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,360
eventually when all the milestones are

860
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,440
hit on the way to e2

861
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,279
the original ethereum network will

862
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,480
become a shard

863
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,679
of the eth2 network and will be switched

864
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,480
over

865
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,399
and then you can scale horizontally and

866
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,240
and you should be able to scale

867
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
uh pretty well all depending on how the

868
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,919
messages are able to route between route

869
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,519
between the shards

870
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,880
however um it's not going to get here in

871
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,679
time

872
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,640
like we need it now we don't want to

873
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,720
wait two years for this

874
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,480
and so there's been alternative

875
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
solutions that have been proposed and

876
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,399
are actively being worked on now will

877
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,120
probably show up around the summer

878
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,240
for what they call layer two and

879
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,880
these are often kind of roll-up

880
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,159
solutions

881
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,240
where you can broadcast a whole bunch of

882
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,279
transactions

883
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,559
on this second layer above ethereum

884
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,320
and those networks can resolve faster

885
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,960
they can um they don't have the same

886
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,720
kind of like

887
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,039
bandwidth requirements as ethereum as a

888
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,120
base network requires

889
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,559
and and when that layer two network

890
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,440
resolves the transactions it settles

891
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,000
back to

892
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,200
the ethereum base layer so it still

893
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,039
depends on the ethereum network

894
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,919
for its security to make sure that all

895
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,519
the transactions that happen on their

896
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,559
network

897
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,679
settle on ethereum but it reduces the

898
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,200
number of transactions that are actually

899
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,120
being processed on ethereum by

900
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,279
a large margin and even vitalik himself

901
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,399
in a forum post was talking about how

902
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,559
it's very likely that layer two

903
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,159
solutions are gonna solve the scaling

904
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:28,559
issue

905
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,799
really well this summer and could

906
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,720
potentially provide even more scaling

907
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,559
than sharding

908
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,760
and even though sharding might be a

909
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,120
cleaner solution because you don't have

910
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,440
these like multiple layers and stuff

911
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,600
he's like it's entirely possible that we

912
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,159
get accustomed to the layer 2

913
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,279
pattern and we are enjoying a lot of

914
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,240
scaling

915
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,240
and we just never do sharding because we

916
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,000
don't need it anymore

917
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,279
and that's a possibility and it will

918
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,679
be interesting to see how it plays out

919
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,519
um but it's it's not like sharding is

920
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,799
the solution

921
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,039
it's entirely possible that layer two

922
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,320
could be

923
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,080
uh or it's possible that we'll have some

924
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,760
hybrid of both

925
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,200
and so layer to so

926
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,799
these these transactions they

927
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,360
happen off the blockchain but get

928
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,480
settled on the block

929
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,640
on the blockchain after a bunch of them

930
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,840
happen or something like that is it am i

931
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,519
understood it's similar to

932
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,760
um like lightning network uh that's like

933
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,320
the the bitcoin layer too

934
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,360
um and it's you're essentially just

935
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,480
trying to

936
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,360
have a way to process transactions that

937
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,679
will

938
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,760
ultimately settle on the network that

939
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,360
you're operating on

940
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,880
because you want you don't want to lose

941
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,039
the security you get from

942
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,720
all the people running ethereum miners

943
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,240
but you need to find some way to

944
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,640
alleviate some of the pressure

945
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,320
that's coming through on that network

946
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,919
and that can be done

947
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,240
by consolidating down these transactions

948
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,519
on the second layer

949
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,320
into what they call like a roll up into

950
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,919
the base layer

951
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,600
so is there any risks to that because

952
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,279
you did mention that you know

953
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,520
the the reason we do it this way and the

954
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,040
reason that we have these gas prices

955
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,719
because the ethereum miners are the ones

956
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,639
that are verifying that this transaction

957
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,159
happened and all these different nodes

958
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,839
all over the place right

959
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,280
so and i guess that still happens

960
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,960
but it happens off the chain

961
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,040
before it comes back on so is there is

962
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,480
there any kind of risks to that

963
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,440
that are inherent to that yeah i think

964
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:31,918
if

965
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,239
um like if everything moved over to this

966
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,079
system and like there were like

967
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,679
nothing but roll-up transactions on

968
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,440
ethereum that would test that network a

969
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,960
lot because then you're just

970
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,320
switching one chain's problems for

971
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,280
another um i think the expectation is

972
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,239
that

973
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,359
some portion of the volume will move to

974
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,560
a roll-up

975
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,800
and it'll depend on as people adopt it

976
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,839
because you'll need to like

977
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,879
adjust your wallet software uh

978
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,480
that some portion will move and it'll

979
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,320
kind of alleviate

980
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,359
that pressure enough to be able to

981
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,160
support like growing the ethereum

982
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,720
network

983
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,839
as we need um and i think like

984
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,520
there's a few different implementations

985
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,680
i think optimism is one of the

986
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,560
optimism and loop ring are two of the

987
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,000
projects that are coming along

988
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,200
pretty well and um

989
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,320
i think they're going to be making

990
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,560
design choices that will affect

991
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,560
that question as well yeah it'll be

992
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,760
interesting to watch and

993
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,880
see what happens um so you mentioned the

994
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,960
ethereum you know ethereum two we're

995
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,160
looking at uh

996
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,760
moving from proof of work to proof of

997
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,520
stake um

998
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,359
what's what can you just explain what

999
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,040
the difference is there

1000
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,160
yeah uh for proof of work

1001
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,640
you are taking the next set of

1002
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,320
transactions

1003
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,760
you are running through what's called a

1004
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,599
hashing function which just basically

1005
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,760
means you take a big chunk of data

1006
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,440
you run it through a function computer

1007
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,880
function it spits out a unique

1008
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,160
identifier for that

1009
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,640
data so you say we take like five

1010
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,240
transactions

1011
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,920
you know send one bitcoin here one cent

1012
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,280
one bitcoin there

1013
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,280
and that text in binary format

1014
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,720
gets converted into a hash and if they

1015
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,400
find a hash with a certain number of

1016
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,680
leading zeroes on it

1017
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
that's considered valid and all the

1018
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,440
other minors agree

1019
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,040
that that's a valid block and that's

1020
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,520
mining in proof of work

1021
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,320
and in that scenario it's really just

1022
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,240
comes down to who can guess the most

1023
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:28,800
hashes

1024
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,560
because you just try one hash then you

1025
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,839
try another one they try another one you

1026
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,119
try another one

1027
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,599
and they'll be doing millions and

1028
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,839
millions of these to find a block

1029
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,839
and it takes energy and takes time

1030
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,359
and it's intentionally competitive

1031
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,440
to make a lot of people trying to get

1032
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,480
that

1033
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,320
correct hash and and that's

1034
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,000
why you get a reward for finding it

1035
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,359
because you're putting in the effort to

1036
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,640
find it

1037
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,480
and it's what prevents people from just

1038
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,560
making up their own blocks quickly

1039
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,800
to rewrite history and to decide where

1040
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,760
things go

1041
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,079
like it is intentionally difficult and

1042
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,440
you have to show that you've

1043
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,240
put in the work to produce a block to

1044
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:10,960
secure

1045
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,800
what transactions should get processed

1046
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,640
and like that's that's what we kind of

1047
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,920
depend on now for bitcoin and ethereum

1048
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,280
there's all sorts of criticisms that

1049
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,200
come with that um

1050
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,160
it's you know expensive on energy uh

1051
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,000
it's

1052
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,800
unnecessarily costly for this

1053
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
competition to occur to find the next

1054
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,960
block i think i read something

1055
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,480
just on the energy thing i just read

1056
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,240
something recently that it was

1057
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,720
i think uh the amount of energy spent on

1058
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
bitcoin mining last year was like enough

1059
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,560
to power argentina or something like

1060
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,119
that

1061
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,079
yeah i read that as well uh it's it's

1062
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,599
also

1063
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,240
i don't i mean i i agree there's like i

1064
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
i like proof of stake i think that it

1065
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,839
is a better solution uh however that

1066
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,839
i just wonder like how much electricity

1067
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,079
jp morgan uses in all of their buildings

1068
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:00,560
across

1069
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,359
the world every year so i mean that's

1070
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:03,839
similar

1071
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,880
too like that is a similar thing so

1072
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,960
yeah but uh with proof of stake

1073
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,359
what we really want to accomplish is

1074
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,520
like uh we want to have the same level

1075
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,680
of security or even better

1076
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,119
but we don't want to have to do this

1077
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,960
like guess and check process with the

1078
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,520
hashes to see if we found a valid one

1079
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,320
so instead instead of using that like

1080
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,800
raw

1081
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,240
like compute power as the incentive to

1082
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,680
secure the network

1083
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,560
we use we leverage financial uh

1084
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,680
incentive

1085
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,839
to secure the network and we accomplish

1086
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,280
that by

1087
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,880
having anyone that wants to produce

1088
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,480
blocks uh

1089
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,560
stake their funds in the same way of

1090
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,000
like putting money into

1091
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,040
a pot you know when you're playing poker

1092
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,960
you're like putting money in say all

1093
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,640
right that money's in there

1094
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,839
and you're agreeing if i mess up you can

1095
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,760
take it

1096
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,119
and the more money you put in the more

1097
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,240
likely you are

1098
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,800
to produce the next block so you're

1099
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,720
incentivized to put more money into the

1100
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,760
system

1101
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,040
and the more money you have in the

1102
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,520
system the more incentivized you are

1103
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,920
to behave and do it right so

1104
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,440
in a scenario where we have a group of

1105
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,599
minors and we're all in proof of stake

1106
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,520
and we all put money into the system and

1107
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,720
we say all right

1108
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,480
everybody puts in 10 ethereum or

1109
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,400
whatever and

1110
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,520
um someone comes along and puts in 50

1111
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,560
aetherium

1112
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
they're going to get the chance to

1113
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,079
produce a block

1114
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,480
five times more often or so you know

1115
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,520
it's

1116
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,040
it's calculated depending on how much

1117
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,960
you put into steak

1118
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,920
and that person if they mess up or they

1119
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,839
they do things the wrong way

1120
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,960
or they act maliciously

1121
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,560
the thinking is that it's going to hurt

1122
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,040
the value of the ethereum they put in by

1123
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,440
more than they could stand to gain by

1124
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,359
behaving that way

1125
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,640
and they don't have any incentive to

1126
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,599
misbehave or act maliciously because in

1127
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,040
order for them to have

1128
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,960
in a good decentralized system in order

1129
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,960
for them to have

1130
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,560
enough frequency of producing blocks

1131
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,800
to be able to consistently do execute

1132
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,000
something like a 51

1133
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,040
attack uh they would be just

1134
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,960
ruining the value of the coins that they

1135
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,400
have in there and they'd be getting

1136
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,520
slashed

1137
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,280
because they'd be getting taken by the

1138
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,560
system because they're not producing

1139
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,319
valid blocks

1140
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,359
every other miner in that system gets

1141
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,119
rewarded if they point out a problem

1142
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,119
so if both of us are miners and i

1143
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,960
produce a bad block

1144
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,520
you can point out hey they just double

1145
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,000
spent

1146
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,960
that balance or they didn't produce this

1147
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,079
the right way or they didn't produce a

1148
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,319
block at all when they were supposed to

1149
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,640
and every time that you point it out my

1150
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,560
state gets slashed and you get a reward

1151
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,760
so you have this like system where

1152
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,160
you you don't need to have crazy

1153
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,359
computing power

1154
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,079
you can have really fast blocks you just

1155
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,760
need to have everyone behave

1156
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
and have good financial incentive to do

1157
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,800
so

1158
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
and i think like there's a lot of proof

1159
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,240
of stake chains out there

1160
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,960
today that are you know really fast

1161
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,000
really

1162
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,520
you know power efficient all that good

1163
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,119
stuff

1164
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,400
thanks for explaining that i've never

1165
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,680
heard it explained like that and i think

1166
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,760
i finally understand it so

1167
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,480
good thanks thanks for that uh

1168
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,760
explanation

1169
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,480
um in that model and i guess i i was

1170
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,440
thinking about this

1171
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,520
like because because i really like the

1172
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,480
idea of d5

1173
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,119
right that like anyone can get into this

1174
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,720
and you mentioned kind of like

1175
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,760
um you know the

1176
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,480
kind of the dream of it of you know part

1177
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,119
of it or

1178
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,800
cardano for instance and we could

1179
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,160
probably talk about other blockchains

1180
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,119
other than

1181
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,400
ethereum um but to kind of connect

1182
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,200
the banked and the unbanked world right

1183
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,480
um

1184
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,560
in i guess in that proof-of-stake

1185
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,760
scenario so

1186
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,920
we're talking about this this um

1187
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,760
this type of money where it's not really

1188
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,640
nobody really decides anything about it

1189
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,839
like you don't have a centralized

1190
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,720
government that's

1191
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,400
you know deciding things about money

1192
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,760
there's been examples of

1193
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,040
you know governments where they just

1194
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,880
they say no this this

1195
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,480
this this isn't good anymore or

1196
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,319
venezuela for example like their money

1197
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:22,720
like

1198
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,560
people had to have wheelbarrows full of

1199
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,160
it to actually buy anything for

1200
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,079
you know for i don't even know what's

1201
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,160
happening there now but like

1202
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,160
those types of things can happen right

1203
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,440
and i guess

1204
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,880
and so the idea is that

1205
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,760
you know the coins or tokens coins in

1206
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
the d5 space they're not tied to any of

1207
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,640
that

1208
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,839
and then when i started thinking about

1209
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,000
like proof of stake i mean the stakers

1210
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,240
are kind of the elites that are running

1211
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,119
this thing

1212
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,599
you know like and so i'm just like is it

1213
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,680
just kind of swapping out

1214
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,200
you know a uh

1215
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,440
the problem with and creating a new one

1216
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,960
um i don't know i don't know if you have

1217
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,400
any thoughts on that that is you know

1218
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,560
stuff i haven't think about it anyway

1219
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,880
this this gets into the um you know

1220
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,640
decentralized ethos

1221
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,000
of like it's great to have the

1222
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,680
option to hold currency yourself

1223
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,560
like on a treasure a ledger in your

1224
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,359
house

1225
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,400
but like i i personally lost a lot of

1226
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:22,800
eth

1227
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
because i forgot the password i feel

1228
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,319
like it's a rite of passage for people

1229
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,160
that work in crypto a lot to lose some

1230
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,599
cryptocurrency

1231
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,720
because you didn't write down the

1232
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,480
private key or you didn't like do the

1233
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:32,880
thing

1234
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,119
because i was new to crypto and i didn't

1235
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,160
know

1236
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,720
and like that's the risk of

1237
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,480
decentralization like

1238
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,560
you are solely responsible for your own

1239
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,920
sovereignty

1240
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,720
and in a scenario with like stating that

1241
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,000
i described

1242
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,200
uh in eth2 the maximum staked position

1243
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,319
is 32e which works out to like

1244
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,200
250 000 it's more now or whatever back

1245
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,000
then but

1246
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,880
you can't stake more than 32 on one

1247
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,839
machine

1248
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,760
okay and this is an attempt at

1249
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,599
decentralization

1250
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,800
so we'll play this out and like

1251
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,440
what happens then if i if i have 32 each

1252
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,480
at home

1253
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,119
and i spin up my computer or i even

1254
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,040
connect to aws and i spin up a

1255
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,040
computer there and i want to stake my

1256
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,720
heat

1257
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,000
well i have to make sure that thing is

1258
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,520
running 24 7 and responsive 24 7.

1259
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,599
and if it if it misses a block

1260
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,760
validation that it's supposed to hit

1261
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,440
i lose money so that alone

1262
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,040
most people have a hard time with that

1263
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,359
level of like site reliability

1264
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,520
of making sure a computer somewhere is

1265
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,920
running and responsive 24 7

1266
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,960
for for years so that's kind of

1267
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,480
self-selecting out even if

1268
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,040
even though we're decentralized the

1269
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,400
second one is that like

1270
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,640
32 each is still a lot of money you know

1271
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,720
like that's that's a lot of ease

1272
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,440
so yeah it's better than these really

1273
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,440
enormous like stakers

1274
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,800
uh but it's it's still like a lot of

1275
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,800
youth to have and

1276
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,480
high requirements to be able to run a

1277
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,480
staking operation correctly

1278
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,640
the third one is that what we're seeing

1279
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,839
happen

1280
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,960
is most of the centralized firms

1281
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,520
are just running a lot of instances and

1282
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,480
they're just running their normal

1283
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,760
balance but with like

1284
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,000
many staking machines rather than one

1285
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,400
staking machine with one large balance

1286
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,160
and there's there's reasons for

1287
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,599
why it's good to have many sticky

1288
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,280
machines not just one large balance for

1289
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,960
security reasons

1290
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,760
um but we're you're consistently seeing

1291
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,079
that

1292
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,119
in mining whether it's proof of work or

1293
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,480
proof of stake

1294
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,720
there's a consolidation around the

1295
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,720
people that know how to do it well

1296
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,720
right and because they're well they're

1297
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,920
willing to do it

1298
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,920
and take the risk of doing it wrong and

1299
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,640
as a result the people that don't know

1300
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,160
how to do it

1301
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,359
and don't know how to handle their

1302
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,599
private keys correctly they're willing

1303
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,040
to say

1304
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,079
i'm okay with you holding on to it and

1305
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,280
you'll give me a yield for that uh

1306
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,599
but like that's kind of a nice thing of

1307
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:10,960
having a bank or having a central

1308
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,000
organization that

1309
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
takes care of that stuff for you like

1310
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,440
i've seen multiple

1311
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,640
cold storage systems i

1312
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,119
cannot build those systems at home i

1313
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,400
just can't

1314
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,200
and to be able to have the security of

1315
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,640
those systems

1316
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,839
and have access to staking operations

1317
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,240
that's that's the benefits of working

1318
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,119
with

1319
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,480
those like central entities

1320
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,839
interesting interesting and so yeah

1321
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,359
that's something so that kind of brings

1322
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,440
up uh another another topic that a

1323
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,640
friend of mine

1324
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,920
me and my friend we were texting back

1325
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,200
and forth today because we were looking

1326
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,240
at uh

1327
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,400
finance coin it's just blowing up today

1328
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,920
it went up to like

1329
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,520
uh i think like close to 300 uh yeah

1330
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,560
and uh i was like

1331
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,319
wow and i've been hearing about binance

1332
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,000
smart chain and how

1333
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,440
because of these gas fees and stuff

1334
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,040
they've really taken off and

1335
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,839
the coins that are on on that ex on that

1336
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,440
blockchain

1337
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,160
um are really taking off and i i haven't

1338
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,599
really been in it i've been meaning to

1339
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,160
educate myself a bit on it but i haven't

1340
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,000
a friend of mine was saying that you

1341
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,359
know i've

1342
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,760
heard that you know finance smart chain

1343
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,599
isn't decentralized and

1344
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,200
i don't know if you have any thoughts on

1345
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,400
that what what makes something

1346
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,760
decentralized for

1347
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,960
centralized yeah i i think the the most

1348
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,000
important thing

1349
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,160
with any of these decentralization

1350
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,440
conversations

1351
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,119
like even how i just said like yeah

1352
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,240
there's benefits to having

1353
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,079
centralization

1354
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,040
having the option to be decentralized is

1355
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:43,760
critical

1356
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,640
like you need to be able to have

1357
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,599
self-sovereignty

1358
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,839
if you want it and and as we see

1359
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:52,559
ethereum

1360
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,480
gas prices get higher we're going to see

1361
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,680
more d5

1362
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,760
ecosystems and alternative chains

1363
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,960
gain traction because you lose a large

1364
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,240
margin of what you're

1365
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,559
you're getting if you use ethereum a lot

1366
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:07,520
right now

1367
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,000
because you're paying so much infuse so

1368
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,880
i think the

1369
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,440
ability to move your currency to a

1370
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,440
different chain or the ability for you

1371
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,319
to

1372
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,079
take any of your currencies off any of

1373
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,760
these chains and

1374
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,400
be self-sovereign and hold it at home

1375
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,040
that's

1376
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,880
the critical piece of decentralization

1377
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,480
that i don't think can ever go away

1378
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,119
that's why like robin hood gets so much

1379
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:29,760
flack

1380
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,400
about allowing you to buy and sell

1381
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,000
bitcoin and ethereum

1382
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,240
but not be able to send it to a hosted

1383
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,040
wallet

1384
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,839
or to your own wallet and they were

1385
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,040
saying that's not really crypto that's

1386
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,400
just like an investment account

1387
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,480
right right you're just paying someone

1388
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,319
else to buy it for you and then sell it

1389
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:47,440
for you at some point

1390
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,920
not your keys not your cryptos kind of

1391
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,559
exactly

1392
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,119
the the saying that it goes in in the

1393
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,559
crypto space right

1394
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,680
yeah exactly so that's i think

1395
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,359
in my mind anything that kind of has

1396
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:00,880
those characteristics

1397
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,400
is decentralized in my mind there will

1398
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,319
be centralized players

1399
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,440
but like it's decentralized if

1400
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,440
you have those characteristics so

1401
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,640
finances

1402
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,559
sorry go ahead oh yeah so if you're able

1403
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:13,839
to like

1404
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,480
some wallets you can't get your own they

1405
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,119
won't let you

1406
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,960
have your own key right so like if you

1407
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,480
can't grab your own key from it that's

1408
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,319
not a decentralized wallet is it

1409
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,680
right right so i think like uh in

1410
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,839
in binance's case and a few others like

1411
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,359
ripple and some others

1412
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,680
they'll have what's called like um

1413
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,680
authorized validators

1414
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,800
where in in like if2

1415
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,480
if i wanted to i could download the

1416
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,800
software plug in a computer

1417
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,920
start my staker and i can i can start

1418
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,800
mining

1419
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,079
uh the new network and same goes for

1420
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:48,960
bitcoin

1421
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,640
it's probably not profitable because

1422
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,960
there's such huge mining operations but

1423
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,480
if i wanted to i could download the

1424
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,920
software plug it in

1425
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,319
and start guessing hashes myself and try

1426
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:59,760
to find the next block

1427
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,400
i might hit it for you know like the

1428
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,359
lottery

1429
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,880
and i get like the the the block reward

1430
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,640
which would be a huge amount of money

1431
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,720
but it's probably not likely

1432
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,200
so in binance and some of these other

1433
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,760
ones

1434
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,480
they go and they work with organizations

1435
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,359
and they say

1436
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,520
or they run them themselves and say

1437
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,359
we're going to run nodes but only the

1438
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,640
people that we know

1439
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,119
are going to run them and this is like

1440
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:25,680
author

1441
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,839
like they're authorized to run these

1442
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,680
pieces of software

1443
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,680
and yeah it's it's potentially

1444
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,880
decentralized to some extent where it's

1445
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,839
not just one company's servers it's

1446
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,680
software that's run on different servers

1447
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,520
and different clouds and stuff like that

1448
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,040
and they all coordinate the same way a

1449
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,119
blockchain does

1450
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,760
but it is different than pure

1451
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,599
decentralization where

1452
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,720
there's not a governing body that is

1453
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,760
saying you can be a part of it you can't

1454
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,520
even at the block production level so

1455
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,760
like anyone that wants to can go and

1456
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,760
send transactions in in the binance

1457
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,880
chain but

1458
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,119
not everyone can go and produce blocks

1459
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:08,319
and it's like that's the decision

1460
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,079
the mafia if they have like their

1461
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,240
binance mafia so you have to be part of

1462
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,040
the mafia to be a node operator

1463
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,319
same as uh libra or dm now where

1464
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,079
you know they're working with specific

1465
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,480
institutions to be able to operate that

1466
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,599
network

1467
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,480
and and they were selected because they

1468
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,599
were trusted you know

1469
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,920
and like they didn't want just anyone

1470
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,760
showing up running a node

1471
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,559
and it you know the same reason why

1472
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,240
there's some benefits to centralized

1473
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,200
exchanges

1474
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,240
there's some benefits to centralized

1475
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,200
networks as well it's a gradient on

1476
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,880
decentralization it's not

1477
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,559
black or white cool um

1478
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,520
do you wanna so we mentioned a little

1479
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,880
bit about these other blockchains that

1480
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,119
are

1481
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,280
that are popping up um is there any that

1482
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,880
you're super interested in

1483
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,200
any ones that you want to talk about um

1484
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,000
totally

1485
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,839
um what's in your mind i'll admit

1486
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:04,000
there's

1487
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,760
there are a lot of chains that you know

1488
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,760
they come out of nowhere and i'm like

1489
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,680
man that that looks so cool how is that

1490
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,200
not on my radar

1491
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,160
and um it's it's tough because like in a

1492
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,599
bull market you kind of bull market

1493
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:16,400
roulette

1494
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,280
yeah where like every day there's like

1495
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,240
some chain will

1496
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,520
go 70 and you're like what what's so

1497
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:23,920
what's

1498
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,119
great about that chain and

1499
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,040
no matter how i look at this uh

1500
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,160
i i will have a a small

1501
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,920
view of everything that's going on in

1502
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,760
crypto right because there's just so

1503
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,200
much stuff happening and

1504
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,559
obviously with all the obvious

1505
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,880
disclaimers that i this is not financial

1506
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,079
advice

1507
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:48,559
uh i i think that there is going to be a

1508
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:49,839
trend

1509
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:53,599
where um the stuff that's happening on

1510
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:54,800
d5 is like

1511
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,720
reproducing a lot of financial services

1512
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,880
we see in legacy finance

1513
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,119
and i think that crypto will continue to

1514
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,040
eat legacy finance

1515
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,960
until you can do everything just as well

1516
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,079
and defy

1517
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:10,240
as you can today in the banking system

1518
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,319
and i don't think that ethereum can

1519
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,640
support all that and it might take a

1520
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,359
couple years

1521
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,559
maybe they'll figure it out in time

1522
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,480
whatever roll ups will work maybe

1523
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,559
but in the meantime you've got other

1524
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:21,920
chains that

1525
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,720
are providing not only their own like

1526
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,640
layer one platforms

1527
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,040
but they're providing evm compatible

1528
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,240
layer 1 platforms

1529
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,760
so evm is the authoring ethereum virtual

1530
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,760
machine it's how you execute the smart

1531
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,440
contracts on ethereum

1532
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,160
and there are new chains like polka dot

1533
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,559
and avalanche and cosmos

1534
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,319
and some of these uh newer projects

1535
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:51,040
that can run the evm in their chain

1536
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,480
and what what you're seeing with some of

1537
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,359
those

1538
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,640
new developments new chains is that it's

1539
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,000
it's not so much that

1540
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,400
it's like an alternative to ethereum

1541
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,839
like polka dot

1542
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:09,760
they call it like a meta protocol where

1543
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,839
if you separate there's like two

1544
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:12,960
components in

1545
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,160
a blockchain first like smart contracts

1546
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,559
you have like the consensus layer and

1547
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:19,599
you have the

1548
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,359
the virtual machine where you do the

1549
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,200
actual execution

1550
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,559
and uh in in polka dot

1551
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,240
you've got a consensus layer called

1552
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,920
substrate

1553
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,760
and in cosmos you've got a consensus

1554
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,520
layer called tendermint

1555
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,200
and they're kind of building these like

1556
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,480
base consensus mechanisms

1557
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,000
that you can put different virtual

1558
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,160
machines on top of

1559
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,160
so you can have a full blockchain

1560
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,920
that is running the ethereum virtual

1561
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,559
machine and have it be consensus

1562
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:51,680
compatible

1563
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,079
with other blockchains that are rather

1564
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,720
than running other virtual machines

1565
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,839
and like avalanche right now they have

1566
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,520
a an exchange chain and they have

1567
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,760
a smart contract chain and you can

1568
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,280
transfer between them

1569
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,119
but you can run like virtual like

1570
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,960
ethereum contracts on

1571
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,160
on one chain you can't on the other and

1572
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,520
this sort of like blending of inter

1573
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,000
interoperability between chains

1574
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,160
is going to have a couple effects one is

1575
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,839
that it's going to

1576
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,000
make it that much easier for people to

1577
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,119
leave ethereum

1578
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,200
because now you can just literally copy

1579
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,640
and paste over

1580
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,760
and you can see this if you go to uh

1581
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,839
avalanche there is an app called

1582
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,359
pangolin like the

1583
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:40,400
the animal and pangolin is

1584
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,440
100 uniswap

1585
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,839
but it works with ethereum tokens on

1586
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:48,000
avalanche

1587
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,680
and it's kind of mind-blowing because it

1588
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,040
kind of breaks a lot of your current

1589
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,319
models of what

1590
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,160
blockchains are where and what you can

1591
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,520
do with them

1592
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,720
but you're going to see more and more of

1593
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,000
this like there's been more

1594
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,520
interoperability between different

1595
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,400
chains

1596
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,520
and i think the the assets that support

1597
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:03,920
that

1598
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,280
trend are going to do well wow

1599
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,960
that's yeah that's that's crazy yeah huh

1600
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,799
that does kind of break my mind a little

1601
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,160
bit yeah

1602
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,520
mine too um huh

1603
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,880
wow i'm gonna have to look into

1604
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,200
avalanche that sounds interesting

1605
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,079
yeah i think um like parachains are a

1606
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:25,280
common term for this

1607
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,079
like um cosmos i think has been around

1608
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,440
the longest polkadot is one of the

1609
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,799
largest

1610
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:31,839
they're all they're all doing

1611
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,480
interesting things yeah and so the pair

1612
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,200
chain

1613
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,280
so i understood and i just started

1614
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,640
learning about it

1615
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,280
recently but pear chain on polka dot is

1616
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,359
like

1617
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,839
uh i don't know i'm gonna get it wrong

1618
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,680
but like there's like these little

1619
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,400
like blocks that you can put your polka

1620
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,720
dot into in order to grab

1621
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,599
or to i don't to get to get different

1622
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:56,720
tokens on

1623
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,440
the polka dot blockchain it's kind of

1624
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,880
the way you understand it i don't

1625
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,119
really understand it yeah i think think

1626
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:03,920
of it at the

1627
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,079
chain level less so the token level so

1628
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:07,520
like you you can

1629
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,520
like i think cosmos calls you like star

1630
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,880
ports where you can

1631
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,280
peg one network to another so you kind

1632
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,839
of get this interoperable

1633
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,960
transactions and all it's kind of based

1634
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,240
on the idea that

1635
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,480
we want to be able to have secure

1636
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,920
transactions

1637
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,559
represented in this like mutual state

1638
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,079
and i mean it's it's kind of

1639
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,160
like it's kind of crazy when you think

1640
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,119
about the idea

1641
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,960
of some currency leaving the network

1642
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,599
and it's it's really just like making

1643
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:42,880
sure that that currency

1644
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,760
if it is represented elsewhere can't be

1645
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,319
spent

1646
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:49,680
again well well it is you know it's

1647
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,119
you want to always avoid the double

1648
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,520
spend problem yeah and make sure that

1649
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,440
if you are representing these assets in

1650
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,960
different ways

1651
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,920
you're not spending it twice same goes

1652
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,559
for

1653
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,880
stable coins like if we have a bank

1654
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,160
account

1655
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,200
and we we mint uh

1656
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,119
one token for every dollar in the bank

1657
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,119
account you're trusting that we're not

1658
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,200
spending those dollars

1659
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,240
like it has to be one to one so like

1660
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,400
that requires trust of the organization

1661
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,920
providing the stable coin

1662
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,839
and this is just a decentralized trust

1663
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,359
that the protocol is preventing that

1664
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,920
from happening

1665
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,359
and and so um so it sounds like

1666
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:32,160
polka dot and avalanche cosmos are kind

1667
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:32,559
of

1668
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:35,760
you think and so i guess like you said

1669
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,799
ethereum

1670
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,480
and i guess the problem maybe talk a

1671
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,839
little bit about the problem of ethereum

1672
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:41,760
and it's super slow right like that's

1673
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,480
is that the issue that we're seeing or

1674
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,200
well it's just

1675
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,839
it i mean if you think about uh that

1676
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:49,280
proof of work model that i was talking

1677
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,319
about

1678
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,680
um every time a block there's a block

1679
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,599
every 15 seconds on ethereum

1680
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,480
and if you have a miner that's producing

1681
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,079
the block they grab that set of

1682
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,839
transactions they grab it from the top

1683
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:02,480
of the list

1684
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,480
that has the highest fees because they

1685
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,160
want to be paid the most

1686
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,480
so grab the top of the list and run

1687
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,599
through and find

1688
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,240
a block that matches the valid

1689
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,280
requirements

1690
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,359
and then they do it again but if the

1691
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,440
transactions are getting added

1692
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,799
faster than you can fit into a block

1693
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:24,000
in 15 seconds then in order for your

1694
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,520
transaction to get to the top of the

1695
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,559
list

1696
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,799
you have to pay a higher fee you can put

1697
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:29,920
it at the bottom of the list and just

1698
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,520
hope that they manage to get to the

1699
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,960
bottom but there's a good chance you

1700
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,520
won't ever

1701
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,760
get your transaction processed so in

1702
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,960
order to get it processed

1703
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,200
you put it at the fee that's a little

1704
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,119
higher than everyone else's

1705
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,720
so you get picked up and put in the next

1706
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,040
block eventually this keeps happening

1707
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,240
and it drives the fee rate up to a point

1708
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:48,640
where

1709
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,319
in order for you to get in the next

1710
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,319
block you got to pay

1711
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:53,760
quite a bit of money to beat out all the

1712
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,839
other people in the list

1713
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:58,880
and like that's strictly because

1714
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,960
there's a lot of volume of transactions

1715
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,200
that need to be processed

1716
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,160
and it's not anything to do with like

1717
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,040
the miners

1718
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,160
like the miners are doing the same

1719
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,240
process they've always been doing

1720
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,079
but there's just a longer list in what

1721
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,520
they call the mempool

1722
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,559
memory pool but for

1723
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,119
these other blockchains the what's the i

1724
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:19,920
mean you said

1725
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,400
one block in 15 seconds what is like

1726
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,920
what's do you know what avalanche is by

1727
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,119
chance

1728
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:27,040
uh faster than that it's faster than

1729
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,240
that i

1730
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,319
like i think solana is one that's like

1731
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:31,760
particularly fast

1732
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,160
um yeah i remember i don't learning

1733
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,240
there's like 50 000 in a second or

1734
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,200
something like that

1735
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,440
yeah something crazy like that i don't i

1736
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,559
don't fully

1737
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,920
know how that stuff happens that quickly

1738
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,760
um i mean i think

1739
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,599
it uses some other variation of

1740
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,520
consensus or some other

1741
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,599
mechanism to be able to have confidence

1742
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,200
that executes that quickly

1743
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,960
even when we were working at dfinity

1744
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,400
some of the

1745
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,880
the ways in which we were able to get

1746
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,720
that kind of speed

1747
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,720
uh requires um more than just proof of

1748
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,280
work

1749
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,520
you know like it's the process of

1750
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,520
finding blocks that fast

1751
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,200
i don't think it really works you need

1752
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,118
to find other consensus mechanisms

1753
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:20,000
interesting well uh i have like a

1754
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,280
million other things that

1755
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,559
um i talk about but uh if people are

1756
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,359
still listening maybe uh

1757
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,200
maybe i don't know if we bored everyone

1758
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,720
to death with uh

1759
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,000
going into all these things it's one or

1760
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,200
the other either people

1761
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,119
like just have more questions or their

1762
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,359
eyes have glazed over about 45 minutes

1763
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:40,160
ago and

1764
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,440
they're like all right let me know when

1765
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,160
you tell me how much bitcoin's gonna be

1766
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,880
yeah um maybe we could wrap it up with

1767
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,160
it you could talk a little bit about

1768
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,079
uh you know maybe some projects or

1769
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,000
things you're excited about at gemini uh

1770
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
what's gemini working on what we've been

1771
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,920
talking about defy what d5 stuff are you

1772
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,440
guys working on or what are you at what

1773
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,720
do you guys got going i'm not super

1774
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,160
familiar with gemini i got their credit

1775
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,440
card i'm on their list for their credit

1776
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,880
card i'm excited for that

1777
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,559
so i know that yeah they have a credit

1778
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,960
card coming out that uh will pay rewards

1779
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,160
in i don't know if they're paying in

1780
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,079
bitcoin or what cryptocurrency i think

1781
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:11,200
you choose yeah

1782
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,520
uh yeah we're doing awesome stuff there

1783
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,799
uh i

1784
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,280
i recently took over as the pm for the

1785
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,559
wallet team

1786
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:21,440
uh so we're kind of deciding how how we

1787
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,240
want to

1788
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,359
you know really push the industry in a

1789
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,200
good direction and i think

1790
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,680
both cameron and tyler winklevoss they

1791
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,359
both really believe in d5

1792
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:34,160
and they think that d5 is the future uh

1793
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:34,799
and

1794
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,200
and it's it's great to see the traction

1795
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,960
there and the support from gemini to be

1796
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:39,760
able to like

1797
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,240
help with that however we can um one

1798
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:42,960
thing that we've

1799
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,839
we've been working on lately uh that we

1800
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:47,599
announced i don't know a few months ago

1801
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:51,119
is wrapped filecoin and

1802
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,440
this is again that same idea of the

1803
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,400
erc20 compatible token

1804
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,760
that is usable in d5

1805
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,000
the filecoin chain is a totally separate

1806
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,280
blockchain

1807
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,960
and a lot of times people want to trade

1808
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,119
filecoin in d5

1809
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,119
but it's not compatible you can't you

1810
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,280
can't get there from here

1811
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,599
so the way that we're helping with that

1812
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:14,559
is

1813
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:16,240
we're going gonna work with some select

1814
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,760
merchants uh to

1815
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,640
give us file coin that we custody for

1816
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:21,280
them

1817
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,559
and we issue them wrapped file coin and

1818
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:25,920
that rap follow coin is going to be the

1819
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,200
erc20 standard and you can use it in d5

1820
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:33,119
so just like you can trade uh

1821
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,440
a stable coin like die you can trade

1822
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,160
filecoin

1823
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,640
even though it's not uh in the rc20

1824
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,160
asset

1825
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,160
cool yeah that's what they did bitcoin

1826
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,760
just came out or somebody came up with

1827
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,280
rap bitcoin recently where it's

1828
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,920
the same kind of concept right yeah yeah

1829
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,359
wrapped assets i think and

1830
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,599
tokenization in general is going to be a

1831
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:54,240
big part of the t5 trend

1832
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,680
cool cool well um all right any uh

1833
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,240
parting words or uh people want to get

1834
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,920

appreciate you having me on again

1838
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,400
i think uh uh at least once for bull run

1839
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,280
we should do this

1840
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,400
yeah uh yeah i'm

1841

i don't know if you got if you're

1842
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,680

1843
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,720
ethereum called rapston and um my

1844
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,119

presence i i'm

1848
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,240
too busy working on crypto things but uh

1849
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:32,640
yeah

1850
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,200
hit me up uh i i'm usually very

1851
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,599
receptive to chatting about crypto

1852
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:41,200
all the time before we uh before we

1853
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,880
did this podcast i looked up to twitter

1854
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,960
and just kind of just browsed some stuff

1855
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,720
but uh i was like oh website i

1856
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,160
understand what that means now because i

1857
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,760
started doing some stuff on

1858
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,680
i've been messing around with just like

1859
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,440
making my own test coins which is cool

1860
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,400
it's fun i recommend people go to

1861
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,200
remix.etherium.org and you can like you

1862
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,319
can make your own coins

1863
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,559
and you can youtube some stuff it's

1864
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:02,160
relatively simple but

1865
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:05,359
uh to get actually

1866
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:08,640
some kind of um uh

1867
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,319
some kind of what's the word i'm looking

1868
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:11,760
for utility out of it

1869
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,599
tell me that's the word right yeah i

1870
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,839
mean i i had a i had a buddy that like

1871
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,079
uh we made a march madness bracket with

1872
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,200
it really

1873
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,039
it's awesome and it's like you could

1874
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:22,960
collect dues for people putting in their

1875
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:23,760
ethereum

1876
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,920
and it just paid out automatically

1877
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,680
that's cool uh did you do that in the

1878
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,200
main net or

1879
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,240
yeah yeah because i just did that i just

1880
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:32,559
did

1881
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:36,000
uh the rinker bee test nut but uh

1882
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,680
you got to use robson man that's

1883
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,079
reliable okay all right well

1884
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,480
if i get back into it and try to uh but

1885
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,920
it was cool it was really cool to like

1886
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,119
see like i just kind of went through a

1887
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:46,480
tutorial and just like went through the

1888
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,160
motions i didn't really know what any of

1889
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,039
it really meant i'm not

1890
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,880
a programmer but it was it was cool to

1891
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:53,680
see my

1892
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,359
transactions happen on ether scan i was

1893
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:57,599
like i did it i made a transaction it

1894
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:58,079
was cool

1895
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,160
like you you poke it and it shows up and

1896
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,440
you're like oh my gosh

1897
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,160
it does the thing that it's like so

1898
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,359
magical when you get to work

1899
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:07,520
oh it's it's it's so cool it's like i'm

1900
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,280
like geeking out about this stuff

1901
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,160
and uh two years ago i would never

1902
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,400
thought about that but anyway so

1903
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,839
one of the craziest things about that is

1904
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,760
that you can go and do that play around

1905
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,480
the weekend

1906
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,480
effectively like do the same thing with

1907
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,799
an account that billions of dollars are

1908
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:23,760
running through

1909
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,920
yeah and like you it's really hard to

1910
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,280
make your own bank

1911
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,880
in the u.s banking system like that's

1912
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,640
really hard to do right this is easy to

1913
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,039
do

1914
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,880
that's really hard to do and it's like

1915
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,640
it's crazy that's why i got so excited

1916
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,440
about it yeah thanks

1917
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,880
and i guess i couldn't really explain it

1918
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,400
but that's why you know it's like this

1919
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,920
is what these guys are doing i mean

1920
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,359
it's a little more complicated they got

1921
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:43,119
more code around it and like they know

1922
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:44,079
what they're doing

1923
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:47,119
basically the same idea right awesome

1924
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:48,160
all right well this has been a lot of

1925
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:48,960
fun man

1926
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,760
you know uh you know thanks thanks for

1927
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,680
jumping on here again and yeah let's do

1928
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,119
it again once a bull run i like that

1929
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:56,079
idea

1930
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:01,839
for sure man take it easy all right
