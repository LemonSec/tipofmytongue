of the world and I just want to talk a

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,840
little bit about how we originally met

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:26,039
we met at Burning Man at 2019 and and we

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,519
were kind of emailing back and forth I

10
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:31,140
emailed you an outline this morning and

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,360
you responded with like a lot of

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,040
thoughtful things about what you wanted

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,450
to talk about and like all this is great

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,879
and I wanted to talk about how we met at

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,600
Burning Man and one of the things you

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,190
said was something about with my wizard

17
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,440
head I was like I'm gonna put the wizard

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,030
hat back on I'm gonna get the robe on

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,280
and because I'm not gonna be able to

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,110
wear it at any burns this year because

21
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,480
of coronavirus and everything so I'm

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,219
like you know what this will give me

23
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,140
some nostalgia and I can kind of

24
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,180
remember what it was like being at that

25
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,579
place and I gotta say you really

26
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,000
inspired me at Burning Man you know one

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,850
of the I think one of the things one of

28
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,979
my favorite things was being the

29
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,189
welcomers do you remember like welcoming

30
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:15,780
your patch your greeters badge I see you

31
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,850
got on there yes I got the I got the

32
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,920
badge yeah I did it yeah and but I

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,990
remembered your energy of you know

34
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,970
welcoming people and like this is their

35
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,390
first like you know interaction with

36
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,280
anyone with an inside the gates is the

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,770
greeters and the greeters you know in

38
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,900
the way that you welcome people was just

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,030
did the most energy and high energy and

40
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,040
I'm like oh I'm gonna I'm gonna do that

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,720
I'm gonna be like that you know and so I

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,549
tried to do that so you inspired me to

43
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,009
do that and it was so much fun and like

44
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,780
I remember giving I think that's

45
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,820
probably the most hugs I've ever given a

46
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,200
stranger in a day you know cuz you just

47
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,570
hug everyone and it's just it's so much

48
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,990
fun and I remember I was walking around

49
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,540
it was like I I was watching some son TJ

50
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,700
light deep playa all night and I was

51
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,140
like walking back I was walking to the

52
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,970
bathroom I was I just got done with the

53
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,038
bathroom which was a huge line it was a

54
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:11,790
whole thing

55
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,800
but anyways some late he's like hey

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,230
sorcerer you checked me in and like I

57
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,510
can she she talked about that experience

58
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,210
and it's like no I and III didn't

59
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,590
remember because I there's hundreds of

60
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,180
people I checked in right like you know

61
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,610
are greeted but but anyways and I just

62
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,170
remembered your your energy there and

63
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,360
also just like I'm seeing the the Playa

64
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,250
Fashion Show and everything just like

65
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,560
the energy that you had and carried with

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,100
you is really inspiring so thank you for

67
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,800
that well thank you for that and that

68
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,390
nice introduction because I'm gonna be

69
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,680
honest a lot of times when I think about

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,960
what I do at Burning Man like I'm not

71
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,940
one who usually starts like my own

72
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,190
activities I love volunteering and

73
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,840
participating so actually you wouldn't

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,600
like I admire it like you're like

75
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,090
admiration for like the things that I I

76
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,610
think just are so natural like greeting

77
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,470
people and like reciprocating the love

78
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,570
that they're already giving you I just

79
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,580
kind of tap into it because you are

80
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,080
actually someone who even if it was like

81
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,940
your first time like jumped in had a

82
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,590
workshop I've never even done that

83
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,050
before so just knowing that like in our

84
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,420
camp you created a space of like having

85
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,130
people come in and realizing like what

86
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,020
it means for them to like discover their

87
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,209
own magic and have them have like their

88
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,250
own experience of what it means to like

89
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,380
have a potion of like apple cider

90
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,060
vinegar or just like share with other

91
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,220
people like what is your animal that you

92
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,989
relate to and like having like little

93
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:33,420
chance like you created a space out of

94
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,550
nothingness and I think that is magical

95
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,620
because I'm somewhat yes that I think

96
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,230
creates within spaces but on thank you

97
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,820
for letting me know that you you

98
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,440
appreciate it because that makes me feel

99
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,190
really good

100
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,980
cool awesome and I think that um and I

101
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,050
really like that you really enjoyed the

102
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:57,030
the magic spell work and and I had I had

103
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,709
a lot of fun with I did that with a lot

104
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:01,320
of people at Burning Man you know like

105
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,610
when I meet them I'd say my name is

106
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,130
sorcery and then I'm you know the view

107
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,450
like sorcerer I'm like yeah I do magic

108
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,770
spells you want to do one and we do a

109
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,110
quick you know magic spell where we'd

110
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,330
say Playa Playa playa those me the magic

111
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,220
words and you'd envisioned you know the

112
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,360
person that you wanted to be in the

113
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,890
future anytime you wanted to do it right

114
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,140
and people really like that and I was

115
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,880
just like wow that was that was cool

116
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,500
that was powerful and like a lot of

117
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,300
people really enjoyed it you know

118
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,370
and I think about that now and I'm kind

119
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,189
of on this like trend of of

120
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:32,020
consciousness hacking and that's why I

121
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,340
wanted to have you on the podcast

122
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,909
because you wrote a book an amazing book

123
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:41,560
and I feel like in and and you I saw you

124
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,300
had a post on Facebook they hey I've

125
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,500
finished this book anyone want to read

126
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,759
I'm like yeah I want to read the book

127
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,740
and then someone else sent me a book and

128
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,569
then I found a book that my wife and I

129
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:51,610
started together last year so it was

130
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,889
like this whole like thing about you

131
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:56,650
know the universe like pointing to like

132
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,599
write a book and like now you know

133
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,490
people that are authors how cool is that

134
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,500
and so I feel it's like kind of getting

135
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,539
that's a consciousness hack in itself I

136
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:09,819
feel like getting these ideas out of

137
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:11,800
your head onto paper and a creative way

138
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,069
in Chang I realize that maybe what we're

139
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,479
really tapping into when we're talking

140
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,550
about this consciousness is recognizing

141
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,259
that energy just kind of comes to us and

142
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,659
at least with me my intuition sometimes

143
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,719
is not always in the right like

144
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:30,460
direction I don't always align with it

145
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,259
even though it helps me stay grounded

146
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:34,960
cuz like just knowing like when someone

147
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,789
sees you like you literally are just a

148
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:39,550
source of magic like I mean just looking

149
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,050
at like the the wide-brimmed like

150
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,940
pointed hat like even though I didn't

151
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,560
know you and we first like we're camp

152
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,110
mates cuz check their camps were camped

153
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,150
together it's realizing that like

154
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,099
combinated energy comes together and

155
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:52,599
like you literally have become a source

156
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:54,969
of like what it means during everything

157
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:57,310
with Kovach 19 at like finding magic

158
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,919
even in a world where were kept within

159
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,479
our own houses and like within our own

160
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:03,879
confined spaces so thank you for still

161
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,740
having that be like a manifesting of

162
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,080
like people being able to connect cool

163
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,740
thank you yeah I appreciate that and so

164
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,729
I wanted to talk a little bit about

165
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,199
writing a book like why did I write a

166
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,169
book you know it's it's something that I

167
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:24,400
find doing it and there's a quote Kurt

168
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,180
Vonnegut says that writing is like

169
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,069
alright when I'm writing I feel like a

170
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:33,069
man with no arms or legs with a crayon

171
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:37,330
in his mouth just like I know what you

172
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,200
mean I'm trying

173
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,300
this book and it's just like I wonder

174
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:46,000
what my head to the wall the short

175
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,190
answer is I ran out of room in my

176
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,360
journal oh it's like everyone has their

177
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,100
own journey for it right and so the way

178
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,860
that I started with writing my book was

179
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,590
actually after my first year at Burning

180
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,070
Man in 2015 I had started doing journal

181
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,720
entries specifically because like I I

182
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,700
started experiencing like real

183
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,250
heartbreak like I had been out of

184
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,140
college now I had started a relationship

185
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,360
for about a year and a half this

186
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,460
gentleman actually bought me my ticket

187
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,820
to Burning Man and then our relationship

188
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,190
for its own reasons ended up splitting

189
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,950
and for like all these different reasons

190
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,380
of why I'd always like journal there why

191
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,600
I'd always like documented my life I was

192
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,940
realizing that it was all kind of just

193
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,400
like repeating like and I almost refused

194
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,340
to see my own faults but I also would

195
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,680
find myself being mad at people for like

196
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,690
not wanting to take the blame

197
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,790
wanting to put all the blame on me but

198
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,320
then not wanting to like talk about it

199
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,640
so we could return to a state of being

200
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,270
friends so after I had all these like

201
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,360
conversations and stuff and me realizing

202
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,070
within myself that there was something

203
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,290
that I clearly was writing down on paper

204
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,200
that I didn't want to see um

205
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,450
the universe had me go to Burning Man

206
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,210
and within like that week and a half

207
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,310
that I was there I kid you not like I

208
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,860
had more personal growth and self-worth

209
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,670
of what it meant for me to expand within

210
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,860
like my own self-love and that was the

211
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,150
biggest thing I think I was I was

212
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,270
missing I I was so often trying to find

213
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,820
like how could I look good how could I

214
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,890
be good how could I have people think

215
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,680
I'm good and as often as you think you

216
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,630
want someone else to think that you

217
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,340
realize you're not allowing yourself to

218
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,710
be that similar we were talking like

219
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,659
egos and what now like so often when

220
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,010
you're in your head instead of just

221
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,200
being with like the present like I I

222
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,599
feel like I wasn't actually allowing

223
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,909
myself to feel the hurt feel the

224
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,160
embarrassment feel like the anger

225
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,050
because I was always trying to just have

226
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,390
it look good so at least for me why I

227
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,880
wrote a book is it pays

228
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,370
it pays my homage to just that that

229
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,290
personal challenge that you take to

230
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,160
share why you are and why I am still

231
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,200
struggling for the self love through

232
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,720
like this discovery where relationships

233
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,760
are still important to me but I still

234
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,700
haven't given them the full ability to

235
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,500
like air themselves out not with other

236
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,810
people but just through myself like for

237
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,450
family for friends for my line of work

238
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,130
and then lastly like my own identity

239
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,440
because I feel like and I write about

240
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,200
this more often than I have in the first

241
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,750
book as you said like write write books

242
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,640
I actually am writing a four-part series

243
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,060
happens to be one of four but the idea

244
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,300
behind identity like what I hope to gain

245
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,240
out of this full series is to have

246
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,550
people realize that everyone in your

247
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,260
life even if you want to write them off

248
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,270
for forever or they have already passed

249
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,600
on and gone to another realm on these

250
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,000
little echoes that I have in this book

251
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,530
are something that people have been

252
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,940
letting me know that they relate to

253
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,620
because even though I'm a different

254
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,120
person and I have different

255
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,310
relationships like these different

256
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,860
shapes of the conversations happen in

257
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,110
everyone's stages so I wrote this book

258
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,450
specifically because I want to complete

259
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,630
my chapters not just in the book but

260
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,360
through saunder light and what it means

261
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,190
to go through completing with your

262
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,620
family your friends what you want to do

263
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,600
as your purpose of line of work in this

264
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,700
universe and then also finding your I

265
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,790
own identity and a lot of that I call as

266
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,570
self discover me moments and it happens

267
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,370
in that order you you have to first

268
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,110
admit that there's something maybe that

269
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,540
you haven't seen in yourself and then

270
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,370
you express it and some people do it in

271
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,950
music some people do it in podcast and I

272
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,780
just happen to find that engineering

273
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,180
wasn't right for me at the moment so I

274
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,460
switched to become an author and I'm

275
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,120
right by writing the book so yeah holy

276
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,000
smokes

277
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,800
something in there I want to respond to

278
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,540
like ten things that you said but one

279
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,300
thing one thing in there and maybe I

280
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,750
should give a or maybe I'll give a

281
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,420
really quick synopsis of the book before

282
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,040
and I'll let you I like it I like you

283
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,860
give your own synopsis but like

284
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,770
I I just there's a quote that I broke

285
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,570
down earlier in preparation for this

286
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,960
that really was a lot of what you just

287
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,680
said and in so first of all the book is

288
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:27,870
sander lives or sander lives right and I

289
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,280
love how you play with language in this

290
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,870
book that's really that's one of the

291
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,670
really cool things your mastery over

292
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,630
language is amazing like it's incredible

293
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,650
and I'm I feel like that guy with the

294
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,660
crayon in his mouth no arms no legs like

295
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,040
I can't find the words you know what I

296
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,280
mean but like yours though the way that

297
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,840
you play with language in this book is

298
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,880
really cool and alright so here's the

299
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,220
quote in and just like I guess the quick

300
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,040
synopsis is sander is a Martian or

301
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,620
Marzian that is amnesiac she's kind of

302
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,700
coming to and like putting together her

303
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,620
past life and and that's what kind of

304
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,720
the book is her memories and things like

305
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,610
that and so this is a quote that I

306
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,360
really thought about while you were

307
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,280
talking everything that is part of this

308
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,210
Universal cycle burns it brightly in

309
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,590
unapologetically from a from from

310
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,180
degeneration to regeneration the flowing

311
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,150
cycle continuously repeats altering

312
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,000
minute and minute minute in minut bits

313
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,620
in versions of history to make it unique

314
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,360
for all versions of experience and

315
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,850
that's that's kind of like what you were

316
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,680
saying right there and then the key to

317
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,900
discovering lave is to find happiness

318
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,750
within yourself and yeah that like when

319
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,890
you were saying all that I'm like that

320
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,320
really popped out that thing that I just

321
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,550
wrote down and I wrote down just a

322
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,740
couple of quotes but that was wonderful

323
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:11,070
right so anyway so I believe Cassiopeia

324
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,960
then asked after that like how can you

325
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,910
find happiness within others if you

326
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,640
can't find it within yourself right

327
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,610
right and so it's Cassiopeia and I can't

328
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,390
see Opia yeah well again and that it's

329
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,510
funny because sometimes when I I sorta

330
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,850
neuroses people will call it case T and

331
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,970
it's it's I'm gonna be honest the first

332
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,459
time I had seen it spelled I spelled at

333
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:38,649
Cassiopeia um it's based on a star

334
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:40,959
constellation that I just I've always

335
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,279
seen my entire life

336
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,709
ww yeah yes and it she's got such a

337
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:52,450
brilliant story and I'm just like why

338
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,209
would anyone have a star constellation

339
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,820
that is supposed to always be punished

340
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,500
I'm like there has to be other side of

341
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,040
her story and so in this people really

342
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,089
wanted to think about it

343
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:06,880
for a lot of Cassiopeia or cast how did

344
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,430
you say it Cassiopeia SEO Pia

345
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,459
that's why I've already from it so at

346
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:15,730
least the idea behind this mother who

347
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,279
literally is willing to sacrifice her

348
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:20,440
own children I mean technically people

349
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,940
could have seen it that way too in this

350
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,970
book although I have a clan that has

351
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,829
nothing but lave and I'm just trying to

352
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:28,570
share this story from her daughter's

353
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,360
point of view I guess you can say it

354
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,860
because I feel like my mom relates with

355
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,500
her a lot at least within my family so

356
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,260
yeah I thought it was fitting cool and

357
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,029
then so you also mention that you were

358
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:42,690
an engineer and then you kind of

359
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,420
completely changed your path and decided

360
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,579
to become an author how did that come

361
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:52,000
about I'm glad you asked so coming back

362
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,640
from what had me even start writing this

363
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,610
book I had realized how many times I've

364
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,380
been in and out of relationships and

365
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,329
there was one relationship between the

366
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:04,630
one in 2015 and me meeting Daniel when I

367
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,610
moved out here in New York Burnham not

368
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,320
moved out here in New York City when I

369
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,850
moved to New York City I now live in

370
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,600
Minnesota where I for the last like five

371
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,630
years when I was an engineer I had

372
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,390
heavily put on myself this like 12 year

373
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,699
olds determination that when my parents

374
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:24,850
got a divorce it was I would never be

375
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,800
put in a situation where I relied on

376
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,779
someone else to take care of me because

377
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:30,220
I I saw what happened to my mom

378
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,860
like in in the eyes of a 12 year old to

379
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,740
go from like a household with like a dad

380
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,660
who was a plastic surgeon a mom who was

381
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,790
stay at home did like all the PTA stuff

382
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,220
for like schools and then got divorced

383
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,100
like my three older sisters left with my

384
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,900
dad like two of them still don't even

385
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,180
talk to my mom today and then me and my

386
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,920
little brother moving with my mom to

387
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,810
Joshua Tree which was just like so

388
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,340
hectic at the time because like we were

389
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,290
on welfare we were with like my

390
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,540
grandparents and it was just it was like

391
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,490
such like a transition that like I I

392
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,620
made it in my mind I was never going to

393
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,920
rely on anyone ever and so I think I was

394
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,840
just so headstrong and like being in a

395
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,940
career where I could do it all no matter

396
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,700
what anyone said and oh engineering to

397
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,280
be honest it's it's one of those ones I

398
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,530
it's like when people will usually say

399
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,680
like doctor lawyer engineer like there's

400
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,900
a reason engineers one of those those

401
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,280
industries because it's one of those

402
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,030
ones that you have to put a lot of your

403
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,250
life on the side if you're going to be

404
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,160
successful in your career and after

405
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,140
working in Los Angeles on this light

406
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,690
rail project in Crenshaw for like three

407
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,940
years I moved to New York and within a

408
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,470
couple months I have met Daniel which I

409
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,320
know you know Daniel but you guys are

410
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,060
one of my favorite couples you guys are

411
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,800
awesome like he had to put up with a lot

412
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,540
of what Janine was still dealing with

413
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,280
with this 12 year old struggling to like

414
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,130
be everything of like independent

415
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,630
because I was given another opportunity

416
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,370
that I didn't take but I would have been

417
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,060
in your neck of the woods it was a job

418
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,970
for Walsh in their headquarters in

419
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,819
Chicago right outside of the the

420
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:16,569
Millennium Park but um I chose at that

421
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,150
moment like really ask Daniel because at

422
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,280
the time he's like he'd only ever see me

423
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,170
like this um my typical day would go so

424
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,550
I'm like kind of backtracking of like

425
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,540
why this was so relevant to me but um my

426
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,640
typical day would be like I'd workout it

427
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,290
was so bad I'd like work at like 3:30

428
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,740
a.m. like at least for like 40 minutes

429
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,000
or so if I didn't go to the gym if I

430
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,080
went to the gym then I was like another

431
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,370
hour if I like and then I'd have to wake

432
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,890
up even earlier so insane but I'd be

433
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,650
ready out the door but like

434
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,140
I'd have to like ride the bus get to

435
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,110
work by like 6:00 my crews would be on

436
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,020
the field by 6:30 I would work all day

437
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,490
like crews usually went home by like

438
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,470
3:30 doing all the paperwork and whatnot

439
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,990
if I was lucky sometimes I get up like

440
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,630
5:00 or 5:30 and then another like hour

441
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,340
commute back home and it was just like

442
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,100
it was it was kind of draining on me and

443
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,380
at least for me like I was okay to tough

444
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,970
it out like this was like three years

445
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,340
like no more big deal than it had been

446
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,320
when I was in Los Angeles but this was

447
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,670
the first time I had someone who I

448
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,650
thought was actually really worth it and

449
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,810
so when I was talking to Daniel about

450
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,960
going to Chicago for this next job it

451
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,730
kind of had like us have a real

452
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,920
conversation like he would totally

453
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,990
support me but he didn't know if he

454
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,110
could actually keep doing this knowing

455
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,750
that for as much time as he was spending

456
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,550
away from his family and everything that

457
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,760
he was doing to come see me sometimes I

458
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,530
wasn't really home and so I I really had

459
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,330
like a hard contemplation at that point

460
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,820
because I started realizing like who was

461
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,430
i living my life for and so it was

462
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,960
interesting because it was it was in

463
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,450
September as literally I I had given up

464
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,370
going to Burning Man because I was going

465
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,140
to a wedding and all these other things

466
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,910
and at least for a work they weren't

467
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,260
gonna give me the full two weeks off so

468
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,570
like I chose to go to the wedding and

469
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,610
when I came back literally on September

470
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:07,260
11 I told my boss in 2018 I was like I

471
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,230
can't do this anymore

472
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,870
so I had stepped away from engineering

473
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,610
because I was realizing that it was not

474
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,920
aligning with the person that I wanted

475
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,450
to be as much as this twelve-year-old

476
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,670
wanted to hold on to like being that

477
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,440
hard shell of just that perfect looking

478
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,080
life and having like that career that

479
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,460
everyone's like oh it's amazing it sent

480
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,680
you to New York City I was willing to

481
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,920
let go of this fear that like because

482
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,990
you love someone you could possibly lose

483
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,440
your your livelihood and in that moment

484
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,900
of knowing what Daniel meant to me and

485
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,030
realizing what he means to me so much

486
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,280
especially in like 2020 during this

487
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,550
quarantine I am so glad I chose to step

488
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,280
away from having that career be the

489
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,680
reason that I wasn't living a life that

490
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,160
actually aligned with the type of

491
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,830
I wanted to give nothing against

492
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,590
engineers I'm just saying I i'm glad

493
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,290
after five years i was really looking at

494
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,990
it and realized that i no longer wanted

495
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,990
to have majority of my day be spent a

496
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:13,190
cube working on projects that for the

497
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,400
most part we're always going to be under

498
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,800
construction at least in here so yeah

499
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,020
wow i love that story and you know i

500
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,710
kind of had a similar thing I quit my

501
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,780
job back in 2017 and it was like sort of

502
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,330
on a whim it was just like I was just

503
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,580
kind of butting heads with my boss and I

504
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,890
was like and you know like and it's just

505
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,210
that it just didn't feel right you know

506
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,120
it was just um so I was just like you

507
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,590
know what I don't I don't think this is

508
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,360
really working for either it was you

509
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,030
know and so so I left and then since

510
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,410
then I worked on like a political

511
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,950
campaign I started my own startup which

512
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:58,610
wound up taking me to become the podcast

513
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,290
host of cypher con and took me to

514
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,900
Burning Man and took me to meet you so

515
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,380
like it's just it's really interesting

516
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,980
to see where like these places take us

517
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,830
if you you know jump out and make that

518
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,840
jump you know and so I've been like

519
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,880
creatively employed for like the last

520
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,140
three years and it's it's been it's been

521
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,820
a it's been a journey it's been a rush

522
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,600
so why write a sci-fi novel I have you

523
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,160
always been into sci-fi I think I see a

524
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,310
TARDIS behind you is that right actually

525
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,100
this this is all Daniel Daniel is my

526
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,920
doctor I joke around that I am the

527
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,720
TARDIS though because I feel like I can

528
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,850
make any space feel a lot bigger on the

529
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,870
inside anyway I love creating spaces and

530
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,730
I think that's what had him find me but

531
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,550
um no it's it's interesting because at

532
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,620
least for me like my my biggest pull

533
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,270
towards like wanting to write

534
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,570
specifically science fiction comes from

535
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,190
like me really looking at what

536
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,520
speculative fiction was my my biggest

537
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,990
like homage I guess I would pay to

538
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,390
writing this book was like a mix between

539
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,760
like the reality that I wanted the world

540
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,780
to be

541
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,700
like I think my first actually it's

542
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,780
still funny because it's the first

543
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,910
science fiction movie I'd ever like seen

544
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,830
and it's still my number one if anyone

545
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,350
ever asked like yeah Fifth Element I

546
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,820
like that movie yeah oh my gosh and it's

547
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,470
it's heartbreaking sometimes because I

548
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,750
really do think that like at least for

549
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,490
like the fifth element I feel like that

550
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,530
is one of the reasons that it's so big

551
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,810
for these extraterrestrials trying to

552
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,210
come to earth and teach these humans

553
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,590
love and it's interesting because at

554
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,810
least within that room the other thing

555
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,170
that I really love about the unnecessary

556
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,030
science fiction was like the idea of

557
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,160
like implementing different like tactics

558
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,200
and stuff was brave new world so at

559
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,000
least from a movies standpoint of like

560
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,100
science fiction I always see like Fifth

561
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,730
Element

562
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,010
and then from like a writers point of

563
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,410
view I look at autist Huxley with brave

564
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:04,190
new world so yeah it wasn't always

565
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,230
science fiction in my mind again like a

566
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,670
lot of these and if you read some of the

567
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,860
excerpts they are specifically from like

568
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,450
my trips to like Zion or like

569
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,480
conversations I've had with my brother

570
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,520
and then it just kind of worked out that

571
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,070
I don't think Marines would look that

572
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,930
different if they put on a skin suit so

573
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:26,870
Zion Zion National Park yeah oh yeah so

574
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,210
how did that inspire the book um at

575
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,650
least for that like I started having

576
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,540
this conversation with myself like it

577
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,060
was me I don't remember if I wasn't

578
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,290
really sure if at this time but it was

579
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,200
me and my big sister Nicole sorry my big

580
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,920
sorority cest my in my sorority she had

581
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,840
invited me with her partner and her

582
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,210
brother and his partner to go to Zion

583
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,290
unfortunately her brother's partner

584
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,970
wasn't able to go so like for a lot of

585
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,650
things like we were tag teaming on him

586
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,830
and then um her and her partner were

587
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,480
like always like pretty much like it was

588
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,490
almost like a couple's thing but it was

589
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,380
funny because like at least for her

590
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,470
brother Alex his will now husband wasn't

591
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,060
able to be there so is it interesting

592
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,650
cuz like in one day I remember my

593
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,440
favorite hikes that we did we did angels

594
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,750
landing which is about I think that's

595
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,150
like five point five miles round-trip

596
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,280
and then everyone else like at the end

597
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,660
like they're like oh we're kind of tired

598
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,510
maybe we'll go

599
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,830
weeping rock but no one wanted to go on

600
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,840
weeping rock so just me and Alex but

601
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,040
then me and I'll accepted weeping rock

602
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,780
and we're like let's go to observation

603
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,940
points I kid you not into one day we did

604
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,010
angels landing and then observation

605
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,380
point so like we did a half marathon and

606
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,930
hikes alone and my Angels landings like

607
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:41,460
one of the most intense hikes there is I

608
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,880
haven't died but I've heard have you

609
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,190
have you done it yet sorcerer no I have

610
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,440
not done it like my wife's really afraid

611
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,970
of heights and like we've heard it's

612
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,350
like we so we did Half Dome and so and

613
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,300
and she was really scared to Half Dome

614
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,430
and I've been wanting to do angels

615
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,070
landing and she like I don't know and

616
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,990
actually well she said she'd do it but

617
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,310
last time we went we went with her whole

618
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:10,590
family and so we just you know it was it

619
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,420
wasn't like one that everyone in the

620
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,980
family would want to do you know so we

621
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,110
did like some some easier hikes right so

622
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,760
I do want to do it at some point and the

623
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,900
subway really like because after that I

624
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,550
think it's a called Three Forks or

625
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,260
whatnot like that also leads into it yet

626
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,660
did you like a little bit of um

627
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,830
spelunking but it's like very small it's

628
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,840
like maybe like a 15-foot wall just gone

629
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,280
down and most the ropes are out there

630
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,830
but even for like small hikes like that

631
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,690
like I think that'd be like a good

632
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,160
transition for like people were afraid

633
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,030
of heights afraid of heights but we

634
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,140
started getting some of those things

635
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,820
under our belt so I didn't feel too bad

636
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,550
about the Angels landing yeah we well we

637
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,350
thought we were gonna die in Zion we

638
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,420
went like we did a we went to the Kolob

639
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,370
canyons and we did like a backpacking

640
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:57,090
trip in there and the trail followed

641
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,090
this dried-up riverbed and we just so we

642
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:00,960
just kind of went on the dried-up

643
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,090
riverbed we missed where the trail

644
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,710
actually turned off so we kept going on

645
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,150
this dried-up riverbed that turned into

646
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,220
a canyon and we started like sliding

647
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,650
down these like 20-foot boulders and

648
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,540
we're like there's no way we're getting

649
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,460
back up like it's not gonna happen

650
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,230
so like hopefully we find we were

651
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,270
supposed to go and so he kept going and

652
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,800
then we heard water eventually we're

653
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,360
like okay we're camping by a river so we

654
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,730
find that River we'll find that and we

655
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,560
did so but we were scared for a bit

656
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,880
there's like a rattlesnake that came

657
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,100
across a path for a while and we're like

658
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,850
a good sign and Sammy's very good but

659
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,780
anyways so you're in Zion

660
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,760
you go from angel slamming all the way

661
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,690
to observation point yeah it was it was

662
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,490
interesting at least for a few these

663
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,170
hikes and we had done and then total

664
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,210
side note but I'll talk to you later if

665
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,800
you ever got to needles because if it

666
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,210
was dry maybe it was a good time to go

667
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,790
there but at least for me like it was

668
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,410
like the first time I'd really like had

669
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,910
like those types of moments where it's

670
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,430
like you're doing things that you never

671
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,430
thought you were going to do and I

672
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,020
remember specifically when I got to

673
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,760
observation point and like looking to

674
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,830
the other side I'm like dang like that

675
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,750
is so bizarre that someone's standing on

676
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,240
that side right now like what are the

677
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,550
odds that anyone else in the entire day

678
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,740
started with observation point and then

679
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,780
swish it's like I had picked this weird

680
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,880
feeling like what if someone was doing

681
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,740
exactly what I was doing but like

682
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,320
opposite and again this was before like

683
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,180
I even wrote the book I think I remember

684
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,440
the trip I think 2013 or 2014 but it was

685
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,420
before I even thought about writing the

686
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,580
book but I remember like I started

687
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,140
writing down in my journal specifically

688
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,580
about like having that feeling of like

689
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,820
being in another place in the opposite

690
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,900
time that someone else has done

691
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,120
something and then when we got to like

692
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,850
the bottom of the trail it was like we

693
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,140
were waiting for the shuttle it's just

694
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,000
us too so there was like no real like

695
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,530
side conversation that's one thing I

696
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,730
love about like people who are willing

697
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,290
to like travel with me is realizing like

698
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,940
I don't always talk this much sometimes

699
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,950
I really do love just sitting with my

700
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,840
thoughts and so I was watching this

701
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,600
receptacle and like it was one of those

702
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,690
ones that like had the locked hinge but

703
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,640
because there was so much trash it

704
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,460
wasn't closing and I remember thinking

705
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,170
like gosh when are like the Rangers

706
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,550
gonna get here and like clean this up

707
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,470
like this this isn't how like a parks

708
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,850
supposed to be like this is before my

709
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,440
immediacy area like any of my Burning

710
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,630
Man tactics clicked in like push it down

711
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,850
myself but I remember seeing like these

712
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,300
overweight squirrels and like gosh like

713
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,640
just get out of here like go back to

714
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,550
nature like this is trash like don't do

715
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:33,280
this and I remember like literally after

716
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,320
like that moment like I had this thought

717
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,090
like what if I was the squirrel cuz

718
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,940
there's so many moments yeah there's so

719
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,170
many moments sometimes when I'm sitting

720
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,540
there and I'm like I'm I'm veggie now

721
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,000
and I can go for a run or I'm staying

722
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,620
around and like scrolling on my phone I

723
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,730
could be like

724
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,620
to someone and like in the moment of

725
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,880
water I've seen that squirrel and I

726
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,950
thinking like gosh you look in my mind I

727
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,660
like you look like a slob like get out

728
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,650
of here like you're literally like

729
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,630
scroungy for trash right now like that

730
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,130
that is one of the moments that happened

731
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,740
in my book that I was like like what it

732
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,330
would be like to actually switch them

733
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,340
position because I'm the other thing

734
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,900
that I felt really bad about night hey I

735
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,670
end up cutting this whole part out cuz

736
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,440
like I was like I wasn't ready to write

737
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,960
it yet we got back to our camp and there

738
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,700
were just like opposite of these fat

739
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,130
squirrels there was like these really

740
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,680
like skinny like gamey looking deer and

741
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,990
I just felt so bad I'm like even if they

742
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,000
were like I don't know like sometimes I

743
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,350
think about it and like I think how

744
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:30,010
often like as as we're supposed to be

745
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,960
like nomadic right like how like we

746
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,730
start as a contra gatherers we never

747
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,100
like really stayed like when we create

748
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,460
communities around these like natural

749
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,320
environments where we come and go we

750
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,030
don't even think about it sometimes like

751
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,740
we'll get those extra snacks cuz it's

752
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,900
just fun to munch on like we literally

753
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,640
create an environment for like the

754
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,250
natural inhabitant sometimes to then

755
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,280
become dependent on our stuff and I just

756
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,930
like I was having such a hard time after

757
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,340
that because at first I was like oh

758
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,860
that's so cool switchers position and

759
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,350
like oh I was talking so badly but then

760
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,880
when I saw like that deer I was like

761
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,830
dang like I don't want to switch

762
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,170
positions anymore like I just wanna I

763
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,990
want to have more of like a healthier

764
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,440
type of like impact and I hadn't been

765
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,580
vegan yet I don't even think I was

766
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,440
vegetarian but I started having those

767
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,540
thoughts about what am I putting in my

768
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,570
body but yeah so that's that's how that

769
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,670
whole happened was I on like Zion was

770
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,380
like a huge impact for me to realize

771
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,130
like how how often we can relate from

772
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,950
like so far like distance apart and then

773
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,150
I just had it started having these

774
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,590
feelings maybe we're just like the

775
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:38,050
hiking high but I started really wanting

776
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,480
to like switch positions with other

777
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,960
things not just humans but yeah that's

778
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,200
how Zion played it on it that's nice and

779
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,980
and I like how you know hiking or put

780
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,050
hiking and traveling and like being in

781
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,600
new places can kind of really change

782
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,090
your thought process I feel like if you

783
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,250
like a lot of times when I'm out there

784
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,620
doing something new or going go

785
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,659
in like Burning Man for example are

786
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:07,360
going to and and so we did a trip where

787
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,240
we mean my wife after we graduated

788
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,730
college we went and before we got like

789
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:16,000
way before we got married we took a trip

790
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,580
out west and we went to like 11

791
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,960
different national parks had like eight

792
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,520
different backpacking trips we did all

793
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,340
this stuff and and that's when we went

794
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,409
to the kalam canyons and almost felt

795
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:29,549
like we're here and I and I listened but

796
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:32,830
there's I was amazed at how much there

797
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,570
was in the United States and it really

798
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,190
gets you thinking differently about

799
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,770
things and I feel like everyone should

800
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,720
do that everyone should go travel or or

801
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,190
even traveling especially like in other

802
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:45,159
cultures to like we've lived in Honduras

803
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:49,029
for a year and doing that like in going

804
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:50,440
to a place where you don't speak the

805
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,539
language and you're kind of the outsider

806
00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:54,399
and like trying to figure out and like

807
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,110
I'd always try to talk with my neighbors

808
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,370
and stuff and they would laugh at me

809
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,630
because I was a silly gringo and all

810
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,600
this kind of stuff but it was it was you

811
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,539
know and I think doing that gives you

812
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:06,429
more perspective and gives you a way to

813
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:11,440
like you said observe that other person

814
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,140
and think about did they do what we did

815
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,539
in a different point or you know like or

816
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:18,250
you just you know I think just

817
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,770
empathizing with people and looking at

818
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,190
things from different perspectives I

819
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,750
don't know that's that's that's my

820
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,429
thought when you're saying all that I'm

821
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:30,070
thinking about you know yeah that's

822
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,020
really cool because it gives you like

823
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,520
this new perspective and gives you new

824
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,929
ideas and gives you a spark of

825
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:37,539
inspiration that you can write in a book

826
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,020
that's awesome well thank you thank you

827
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,120
for sharing that cuz yeah it is kind of

828
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,260
a profound thing when you're actually

829
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,440
able to empathize with something when

830
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,210
you seriously have never actually

831
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,010
experienced it like in that case we just

832
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,200
think oh I sympathize but no like I

833
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,750
really do think as humans we have the

834
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,610
ability to empathize without actually

835
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:00,549
experiencing it which is just again that

836
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:02,350
consciousness or that that connection

837
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,140
that we all already have it's just we

838
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,460
don't exercise it and like these

839
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,840
conversations we don't usually have

840
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,630
these conversations to realize how often

841
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:14,470
this does happen yeah so tell me about

842
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,300
the book I gave a little synopsis

843
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,800
that was my synopsis but let me hear

844
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,070
from your angle okay so at least for me

845
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:24,400
it takes place following the new spacer

846
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,070
recruits that had just come into on the

847
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,040
spacer program and you are following

848
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,500
sonder light who is immigration from

849
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,140
mares and she's about to go to earth to

850
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,850
complete her mission but something

851
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,130
happens that causes the universal nation

852
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,220
to report that sander has been lost in

853
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,150
an untimely explosion gasps uh so you

854
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,920
follow her like you'd said like after

855
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,320
she wakes up with amnesia and as soon as

856
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,050
she does she starts realizing that she's

857
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:56,080
pixelated and she's being pretty much

858
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,580
like um not accused but being

859
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,080
infiltrated for information that she

860
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,570
can't collect but as this infiltration

861
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,310
frame information starts happening she

862
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,260
starts realizing she has fragmented

863
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,239
memories that haven't fully been

864
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,300
understood even by her so through all of

865
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,670
this confusion she starts to pursue her

866
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,070
own self-discovery which has her start

867
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,870
uncovering hypocrisy that was hidden

868
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:23,290
within her own spacer program and within

869
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,159
her own mission

870
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,918
so with all of this confusion and all of

871
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:29,590
this need to seek clarity you follow

872
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,989
saunder in what is going to start in an

873
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:34,810
epic unfolding unfolding of her own

874
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,780
discovery through what it means to be

875
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,570
human which i think is very important

876
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,790
for everyone who lives on earth because

877
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,040
as far as I know on earth we are human

878
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,980
beings so you get to experience it and

879
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,909
what I call saunder Liz or saunder lives

880
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:54,639
because as of right now in this book you

881
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,820
take place with Marie even who is trying

882
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,740
to explain to people that she is still

883
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,130
alive

884
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,950
but maybe through the explanation of

885
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,140
what it means to be alive you start

886
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,500
realizing how could any one person not

887
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,720
be alive if we are all part of the

888
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,730
saunder lives Wow that was a much better

889
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:21,660
synopsis than what I gave that's that's

890
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,870
so so one of the things that you play

891
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,820
with and I mentioned before is you can

892
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,050
play with language lab but also

893
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:29,980
community

894
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:35,050
in like the way that people community

895
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:38,500
bar shion's are and not everyone's a

896
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,290
Marzian either so like the way that they

897
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,720
communicate is not always verbally

898
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,609
sometimes it's telepathically there's

899
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:46,900
like four different versions that you

900
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,160
had in there and I remember it's a

901
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,500
verbal the telepathic and then you have

902
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,780
like in italics and underline the other

903
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,510
different ways of explaining how they're

904
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,550
actually communicating I thought that

905
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:00,099
was really clever and I and what so what

906
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:01,540
was the significance of that and why did

907
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,760
you do that and also I was wondering why

908
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,150
do Mars ian's even talk at all it's like

909
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,550
an just telepath telepathically speak

910
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,890
thank you I'm glad you asked that

911
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,329
because like at least in mine so I'll

912
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:14,710
answer your last question and that'll

913
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,849
work it backwards

914
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:18,540
um the reason that my engines actually

915
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,400
do learn how to speak and this goes

916
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,440
through I forget which chapter it is

917
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,320
like chapter four or five Aryans lesson

918
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,290
who's her brother it's because they want

919
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:33,579
to blend in with us because as far as we

920
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:37,089
are as a human race anything that is

921
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:39,970
considered dangerous or unknown for some

922
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,440
reason we think it is great to just

923
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,230
knock it out experiment on it take out

924
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,750
its organs so as much as they want to

925
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,530
they want to blend in and so for them to

926
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,050
learn not only how to speak the language

927
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:57,250
but also speak in American because there

928
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,890
are in America which is very different

929
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,599
than English and I like that you you had

930
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,160
mentioned that because sometimes I was

931
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,339
playing around do I do I spell Oh like

932
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:07,660
English where they start spelling color

933
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,300
with an O you favorite with oh you like

934
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,849
nah I keep it a little bit less on that

935
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:15,190
side but the reason that they even

936
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,579
bother with learning English and how to

937
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:20,890
use the vocal communication is because

938
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:24,940
they are here to help us get out and to

939
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,099
realize that one of the scariest things

940
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:30,970
for at least for me like and it's only

941
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,440
interesting because like this actually

942
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,180
is one of my biggest fears is that I'm

943
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,339
gonna get abducted by aliens and not get

944
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:42,760
robbed off I don't even feel bad if

945
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,060
people

946
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,100
it's weird because I have looked at UPS

947
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,960
or sir and this is a huge fear that a

948
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,400
lot of other people will relate to I

949
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,730
will have you know but um no that is a

950
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,290
fear cuz like I'm same thing with people

951
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,600
who play around with magic like um like

952
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,820
I'd shared with you like III love the

953
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,680
idea of magic but I'm actually terrified

954
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,750
of Voodoo because I don't know what it

955
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,610
means when certain people are able to

956
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,230
tap into things and as long as you

957
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,450
believe it you are actually susceptible

958
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:11,260
to it um so for me like it's how do you

959
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,500
as like a higher not a higher power but

960
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,180
like someone who is more aware of how

961
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,850
connected we are connect with people who

962
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,670
are only able to communicate and one of

963
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,680
the reasons I added this into this book

964
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,240
specifically these different types of

965
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,760
waves of communicating is I said that

966
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,320
kind of weird the different ways of

967
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,420
communicating is realizing that I'm

968
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,430
trying to practice it in my own my own

969
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,590
light like I'm starting to meditate I'm

970
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:38,200
trying to practice astral projection and

971
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,210
the more I'm talking to people about

972
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,160
these conversations that I used to never

973
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,470
have as an engineer sitting in New York

974
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,960
City but I'm starting to find people who

975
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,730
actually are able to relate with animals

976
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,680
and sometimes they're able to talk with

977
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,810
me and they can it's the scariest thing

978
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,970
but it's also the coolest thing they and

979
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,530
I hope other people who are listening to

980
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,210
this actually do get experience this at

981
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,800
least once in their lives like there are

982
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,900
people who can literally tell you what

983
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,300
you are thinking or like how you are

984
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,190
experiencing certain things without you

985
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,320
talking and so just knowing that that is

986
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,930
a possibility that humans carry within

987
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,020
us I'm like how would it look if people

988
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,000
were actually able to tap into this so

989
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,070
the way that I have these different

990
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,560
types of like wording is like based on a

991
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,150
normal book people will see it as like

992
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,980
verbal communication and I'll just be in

993
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,800
quotation marks when people in the book

994
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,890
start using telepathy it's italicized

995
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:33,270
but quotation marks when there are

996
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,650
another level of inner communication

997
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,500
where it's it's like a direct line I'll

998
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,080
do quotation marks italicize and

999
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,960
underline and then there's this fourth

1000
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,480
kind which I don't explain too much in

1001
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,180
this book yet but I have it starting to

1002
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,130
be like recognized is there's a fourth

1003
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,320
part which is the inner intelligence and

1004
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,970
it's when you're able to communicate

1005
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,440
with your

1006
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,750
own conversations as it's a separate

1007
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,540
entity so that is like quotations

1008
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,180
italicized underlined and fold because

1009
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,180
as the books continue on you'll see how

1010
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,589
this starts happening more and more

1011
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:12,220
frequently but so often we are almost

1012
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,609
trained to like have conversations but

1013
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:17,500
then as soon as you like go in your head

1014
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,819
and you start thinking these thoughts

1015
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:21,670
these thoughts seem like they are you

1016
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,069
and one thing that I'm so aware of now

1017
00:40:24,069 --> 00:40:25,810
in meditation is realizing that our

1018
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:29,020
thoughts are not us that is like the ego

1019
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,359
that is our conversation a lot of times

1020
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,500
it doesn't always tell us the best

1021
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,720
things either a lot of times it goes

1022
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,910
into that fear chamber I just like tries

1023
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,190
to throw it all out but the reason I

1024
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,240
have these different types of

1025
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,210
communications is like I want to start

1026
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,319
expressing myself

1027
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,200
in a way that people who are able to tap

1028
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,250
into these different types of

1029
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:52,420
communications understand that I i have

1030
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,050
awareness of it and i'm learning i I

1031
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,880
just don't understand how to do it just

1032
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,210
yet so that that's why I added it and at

1033
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:04,990
least firm arisians again aliens are a

1034
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,210
little bit of a touchy subject for me

1035
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,190
because same thing with like spirits and

1036
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,540
like ghosts and stuff they've they've

1037
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,849
actually had a big role in my family so

1038
00:41:12,849 --> 00:41:15,910
for me like it's not taboo and my mom

1039
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,319
says she grew up with a ghost in her

1040
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:20,140
house or that she will see our our past

1041
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,329
pets come visit her sometimes even here

1042
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:25,329
in Stillwater Minnesota but um it does

1043
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:27,760
freak me out to know that if those ever

1044
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,220
happened to me I get freaked out like

1045
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,810
I'm okay hearing about other people's

1046
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,760
experiences but as soon as it happens to

1047
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,369
me sorcerer I I do kind of go into like

1048
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,980
my they don't take me away kind of

1049
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,770
feeling so that that's why I included in

1050
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,790
my book at least the communication wow

1051
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,170
thanks for sharing all that I love that

1052
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:51,490
Jeanine I was I was you know one of the

1053
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:52,900
things and one of the reasons why I

1054
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,700
wanted to have you on is I've been going

1055
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,130
in to like consciousness hacking and

1056
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:02,079
thinking about how and the reason why

1057
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,369
I'm thinking about consciousness hacking

1058
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:07,020
is on my last podcast we talked about

1059
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,310
observing your thoughts and Krishnamurti

1060
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,299
is a thinker that

1061
00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:12,400
thinks about observing your thoughts in

1062
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,869
your own programming and how can you

1063
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:15,759
hack you in programming and realize it

1064
00:42:15,759 --> 00:42:17,049
for what it is and we're talking about

1065
00:42:17,049 --> 00:42:19,509
it in the sense of well democracy in

1066
00:42:19,509 --> 00:42:21,069
order to have democracy we got to have

1067
00:42:21,069 --> 00:42:22,809
well inform public and it's like well

1068
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:25,089
who told you that like why do you have

1069
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:27,009
to have that it's like well I learned it

1070
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:29,829
in school I learned this I learned so so

1071
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:30,880
you can trace it back to all these

1072
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,229
things that you learned externally but

1073
00:42:32,229 --> 00:42:33,759
like do they really mean anything and

1074
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,739
they're just like these these constructs

1075
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:38,650
and these programs and you can and it's

1076
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:41,259
difficult to do but you can like through

1077
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,410
meditation through thoughtful

1078
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,729
observation you can look at your

1079
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,170
thoughts and look at your programming

1080
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:52,630
and figure out why you don't have to do

1081
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,529
anything with it that's what

1082
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,939
Krishnamurti and that's that's the best

1083
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,349
kind of the thing with Krishnamurti I

1084
00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:58,150
don't get because he's just like talking

1085
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,900
about you know he's got a book called

1086
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,239
freeing yourself from the known and so

1087
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:06,759
on that's a that's on my reading list

1088
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:09,789
and it's like that concept of there's

1089
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:11,979
this freedom when you're not attached to

1090
00:43:11,979 --> 00:43:13,689
your thoughts and your knowledge and the

1091
00:43:13,689 --> 00:43:14,979
way that the world works

1092
00:43:14,979 --> 00:43:17,559
you're a blank slate and you're wide

1093
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:22,569
open and and so I feel like there's

1094
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:24,279
there's these different ways that you

1095
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:25,900
can do that and you're talking about you

1096
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,429
know playing around with astral

1097
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:28,719
projection and I was telling you about

1098
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:30,579
before we started my sister's doing this

1099
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:32,739
shamanic journeying where she's going

1100
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:34,420
into these worlds I think I'm gonna have

1101
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,859
her on the podcast and talk about this

1102
00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:37,170
too

1103
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:42,519
and and you know you can do that through

1104
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:45,069
drumming and putting yourself in a state

1105
00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:48,880
in we're we're living on like this this

1106
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,170
very I don't know basic level and

1107
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:55,209
there's so much under the iceberg I feel

1108
00:43:55,209 --> 00:43:58,900
like a consciousness and so anyway I

1109
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,699
love that you brought that up and I love

1110
00:44:00,699 --> 00:44:03,549
that you put all this into your book

1111
00:44:03,549 --> 00:44:04,719
because you're exploring it I'm

1112
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:06,880
exploring it as well I don't I don't

1113
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,729
know much of anything I actually that's

1114
00:44:09,729 --> 00:44:11,049
one thing I know is I don't know

1115
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:12,160
anything and I think it's something that

1116
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,799
Socrates Feynman famously said and and

1117
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:19,119
it's it's cool I love that concept I

1118
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,329
love that you're exploring it through

1119
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:23,010
what's possible

1120
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:24,060
like there could be all these other

1121
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,740
different types of communication that we

1122
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,960
don't even know about and I think it's

1123
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,880
it's it's beautiful that you're able to

1124
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,910
express that so creativity because I've

1125
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:34,230
never seen anything like that maybe it's

1126
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,650
out there I don't know but have you ever

1127
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,170
um I was thinking about this I actually

1128
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,490
I'll let you respond if you want to

1129
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,730
respond first okay do you have I mean do

1130
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:47,280
you have anything that you want it's

1131
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,080
only justice yes we kind of talked about

1132
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,510
this a little bit before but yeah I need

1133
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:54,680
to reach out to your sister cause like

1134
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,390
as like I'm sharing about this book is

1135
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,730
like the same reason why I'm like okay

1136
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,620
I'm glad I no longer just had these

1137
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,330
thoughts in my journal like this was the

1138
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:04,920
time for me to start having these types

1139
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,050
of conversations and like the more I and

1140
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,880
the more I'm finding like the little

1141
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,440
because like that's another thing that I

1142
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,760
actually really liked it's like on the

1143
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,830
back of my book the clothes like all oh

1144
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,750
it is life but an endless string of

1145
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,600
stories because so often like we just

1146
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,670
keep our stories to herself it's only

1147
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,470
when we share them that we're able to

1148
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,270
echo it out and as soon as you echo it

1149
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,670
out like yes maybe if you only say it

1150
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:28,590
once it won't come back but the more you

1151
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,210
send it out the more you'll start

1152
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,780
hearing the echoes returns yeah so you

1153
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,640
sharing about your sister and sharing

1154
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,200
about these books and like now you like

1155
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,730
the Monroe like University I'm like

1156
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,730
there's so many things like I am so glad

1157
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,830
I'm having type of conversations and not

1158
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:47,010
just keeping it inside anymore like it

1159
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,470
is a really great thing to discover what

1160
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:52,650
humans are capable of when they actually

1161
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,050
do open up and start sharing to other

1162
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:58,230
universes so no I'm good because I

1163
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,670
already know where I have to go and now

1164
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:02,040
I know there's gonna be a podcast okay

1165
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,680
cool yeah it'll be whenever now she's

1166
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,470
now she's doing some trail working in

1167
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,540
California so she's like she's gone

1168
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,550
she's off the grid for like a few months

1169
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:13,140
so I probably won't get to it for a

1170
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,490
while yeah so so but it's the Monroe

1171
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,110
Institute and I'll put that in the show

1172
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,880
notes too and this was the thing that I

1173
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,950
have discovered about astral projection

1174
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,960
like and actually I had a guy on the

1175
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,490
podcast who mentioned shoot so this so I

1176
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,110
had Richard theme on the podcast who

1177
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,760
actually did a lot of research on aliens

1178
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,309
and stuff like that

1179
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:36,469
and he wrote like one of the most

1180
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:38,809
scholarly books on aliens a table like

1181
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:42,339
Project Blue Book and the government's

1182
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,079
their strategy to subvert like the the

1183
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,729
fact that like all of these like all

1184
00:46:49,729 --> 00:46:52,640
these pilots and in World War two all

1185
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,289
saw these crazy things and they said no

1186
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:55,219
we're not going to share that with the

1187
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:56,150
public and we're not going to share

1188
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,789
anything that remote that's about UFOs

1189
00:46:58,789 --> 00:47:02,569
with the public at all and and so so he

1190
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,609
wrote like this whole thing on like a

1191
00:47:04,609 --> 00:47:06,529
book a lot of it was on that and a lot

1192
00:47:06,529 --> 00:47:10,339
of it was on just UFOs in general and he

1193
00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:12,289
mentioned this guy and I can't remember

1194
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:13,670
his name but I looked him up and he was

1195
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,979
one of the leaders in the Monroe

1196
00:47:15,979 --> 00:47:18,140
Institute and also used remote viewing

1197
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:21,410
in the military and yeah it's crazy and

1198
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:23,930
I can't remember the guys name but I'll

1199
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,219
find it and send it to you I'll put in

1200
00:47:25,219 --> 00:47:26,900
the show notes to so you guys can find

1201
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,329
it too but Monroe Institute is all about

1202
00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:32,900
using like these different tones in your

1203
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,489
ears and your headphones that will get

1204
00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:37,910
you to leave your body and be able to

1205
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:40,759
Remote View astral projection and remote

1206
00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:43,400
viewing same same different same same

1207
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,289
kind of concept but like the military

1208
00:47:45,289 --> 00:47:47,390
was using this stuff and like it's out

1209
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:51,619
there and it's super interesting stuff

1210
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:55,189
and it's not something that we we don't

1211
00:47:55,189 --> 00:47:56,959
explore this in school we don't explore

1212
00:47:56,959 --> 00:47:58,910
you know these types of things but they

1213
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:02,089
were real and we can't explore them and

1214
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:04,369
and I'm starting to be like maybe I

1215
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:06,319
should go down these paths a little more

1216
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,529
because they're super interesting and

1217
00:48:08,529 --> 00:48:12,410
and so I yeah I'm so glad you brought

1218
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:15,559
all that up so that's awesome

1219
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,269
hey have you ever read the book stranger

1220
00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:21,679

1222

Martian that comes to earth - well wound

1223
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:32,539

00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,289
about water sharing and stuff it's

1230
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:44,630
really interesting you should check it

1231
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,740
out it's by Robert Heinlein and

1232
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,590
it's a fantastic book about and it's a

1233
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:52,200
good one too strangeness

1234
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,590
yeah stranger in a strange land and I

1235
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:57,869
you know I thought about it when I

1236
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:59,910
started reading your book because it's

1237
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,650
similar in that concept where you take

1238
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:03,960
it's a good way to do a satire you know

1239
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,000
taking an alien looking at the human

1240
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,730
life and it's like you looking at the

1241
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:10,740
squirrel and being like I'll squirrel

1242
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:17,220
don't do that please don't you know it's

1243
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:22,200
I love that I love that concept cool so

1244
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,130
uh do you have any I invited you to

1245
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,840
share any of your favorite passages from

1246
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,730
the book if you want to do you have any

1247
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:35,490
that you want to share with us because

1248
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:37,920
like again any paint homage like the

1249
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,690
relationships that I've gone through and

1250
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:42,000
realizing what it means to let go

1251
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,740
actually I did a podcast with this woman

1252
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:44,310
in Korea

1253
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:46,890
Kate emerald she's amazing I mean she

1254
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:50,220
was teaching me about uncoupling couples

1255
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,080
and like it's the idea that when you

1256
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,119
come into like any type of relationships

1257
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:56,060
and it doesn't have to just be like

1258
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,560
loving ones but specifically this one

1259
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,380
was about marriage coupling when you

1260
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,810
love someone but you no longer want to

1261
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:05,910
be with them there's the idea that you

1262
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,980
love them so much that you want them to

1263
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,680
be happy going elsewhere and granted I

1264
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,060
didn't know it was called coupling and

1265
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:14,550
coupling until like I think was like

1266
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,800
last week when I was on her podcast but

1267
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,410
um the passage that has been sticking

1268
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:21,359
out to me recently specifically with

1269
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,220
like everything going on with like

1270
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:28,080
people feeling a certain way or being

1271
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,820
upset that other people are doing things

1272
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,119
in life the one that sticks out to me is

1273
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,700
one night lady Andromeda actually said

1274
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:40,109
to Sir Reginald and so it goes I mark

1275
00:50:40,109 --> 00:50:42,690
you free from ever being deterred by

1276
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:45,090
another by bestowing on to you an

1277
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:48,150
expression of unconditional bliss to

1278
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:51,570
lave is to live to live is to flow to

1279
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:54,450
flow is to give to give is to grow and

1280
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:57,830
all of our moments this we must know

1281
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:00,570
abracadabra

1282
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:02,880
and the reason I like that one so much

1283
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,680
in my book and I know other people will

1284
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,700
telling like other ones that are very

1285
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,860
profound like in at least like topical

1286
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,810
nature like the reason I choose this one

1287
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:12,450
is it really for me was one of those

1288
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:14,160
expressions that when I was saying it

1289
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,230
I'm saying it's like everyone I've ever

1290
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:18,690
been in a relationship with because for

1291
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,070
people who haven't read the book yet on

1292
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:22,530
the story of lady Andromeda and Sir

1293
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,750
Reginald are there two shooting stars

1294
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,570
that literally are about to collide but

1295
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,070
in that moment it actually means that

1296
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:32,340
they'd be connected but in my mind I

1297
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,560
also have to think like okay even if

1298
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,300
you're connected your giant balls of

1299
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,790
fire flying through space so you're

1300
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:41,970
going to collide and explode which is

1301
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:44,550
also symbolic of thunder anyway um and

1302
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:47,370
in this moment as they're coming close

1303
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,890
she actually says this because she

1304
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:52,380
realizes that if she hit were to collide

1305
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,810
with Sir Reginald he would not continue

1306
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:57,210
for it and for people who don't read it

1307
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:59,700
just yet um Reginald is actually being

1308
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,940
watched by the entire universe and even

1309
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,500
though the entire universe is watching

1310
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,570
Reginald he just wants to be with her

1311
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:08,160
and she doesn't want to be the reason

1312
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,480
that he gets deterred by having his life

1313
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,150
be the legendary thing that it must

1314
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:18,000
become and so she wants to leave him

1315
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,250
with unconditional bliss because one

1316
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,260
thing that I have experienced with so

1317
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,420
many of my relationships is I would not

1318
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,000
be the person I am for Daniel Yanis Ford

1319
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,650
if it was not for all of those

1320
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:30,900
heartbreaks that I used to like hate

1321
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,450
myself for or be so upset that they're

1322
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,070
no longer friendships or be bitter

1323
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,560
towards the way that they ended because

1324
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,420
everything has to happen the way it does

1325
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,790
and the biggest thing that I realize

1326
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:43,650
about energy is it's not supposed to be

1327
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:45,180
stored and it's not supposed to be

1328
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,430
contained and so often I feel like

1329
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:48,960
people get in relationships where they

1330
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,120
feel like I have to stay with this

1331
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,040
person because I've spent so much time

1332
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,650
or so many people are counting on me but

1333
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,960
if you ever live your life for other

1334
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,260
people knowing that you are actually

1335
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,140
sacrificing your own happiness you

1336
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:05,940
aren't doing the justice that you want

1337
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,310
because what I'm finding now is like

1338
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,470
what if you could find someone and

1339
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:12,690
granted this isn't anyone about saying

1340
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,280
oh oh you need to end your relation

1341
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,290
it's realizing like what if you could

1342
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:18,690
find someone and sorcerer like I I give

1343
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:20,610
mad props to relationship to cuz like

1344
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:22,380
for someone to be able to go to Bernie

1345
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,320
man with a partner and then be like okay

1346
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,780
with it like so much trust so much

1347
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,180
unconditional love that you and your

1348
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,650
wife share cuz like that's how me and

1349
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:33,840
Daniel are cuz like there were moments

1350
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,450
when I almost didn't go to Peru I almost

1351
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:39,180
didn't go to California I almost didn't

1352
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,830
go to Burning Man that next year but

1353
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,170
like it's realizing that if you're able

1354
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:46,110
to go on a path and you're so aligned

1355
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,820
with what your purpose is in this

1356
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:51,450
universe I almost guarantee at least in

1357
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:53,580
my mind and what I've experienced is the

1358
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,410
universe will align you with someone who

1359
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:57,720
goes in the same path with you without

1360
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,180
you having to sacrifice anything it

1361
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,060
actually makes you two a lot stronger to

1362
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:06,030
be able to go with your own love and

1363
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:09,120
find your flow and keep giving it

1364
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,070
knowing that the more you give the more

1365
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:14,220
you grow and in those moments we must

1366
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:17,820
all know that magic is all around us and

1367
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:20,850
we should never have to feel like you

1368
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:23,610
have to give up anything in order to be

1369
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:25,590
with someone else so if you could find

1370
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:27,750
your happiness to have those other

1371
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,280
people that you feel like you have to

1372
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,040
like sacrifice your life for if you can

1373
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,590
find it in your heart to allow them to

1374
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:36,900
live whatever life it is by blessing

1375
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,120
them unconditional happiness even though

1376
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,040
you might not be the one that gives them

1377
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,500
that happiness I promise you this

1378
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,540
universe has energy out there that will

1379
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,620
be aligned with you like tenfold but

1380
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,870
yeah that that is one of my favorite

1381
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,280
quotes cuz like I even end it with

1382
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,170
abracadabra because I'm like I speak it

1383
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:59,640
that that is what it is oh yeah my

1384
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,280
favorite passage I love that and I love

1385
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,190
I heard it recently said as you know

1386
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:06,770
it's the difference between a

1387
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:09,450
codependent relationship and a committed

1388
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:12,150
relationship where like the codependent

1389
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,670
is like your kind of tit for tat like

1390
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:17,610
you're you're watching the like I had to

1391
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:18,990
watch the kids today so I'm gonna go

1392
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:21,600
hang out with my buddies and go golfing

1393
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,860
all weekend

1394
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:25,590
you know there's like this exchange like

1395
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,780
I'm giving this thing up so now I get to

1396
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:28,590
do this thing

1397
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:31,080
versus like in the co committed one

1398
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,730
where it's like you're living for each

1399
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,140
other's happiness for your own happiness

1400
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,060
but also for your each other's happiness

1401
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,030
and and so I love that that's that's

1402
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:39,660
fantastic

1403
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,080
um and I did want to talk a little bit

1404
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,360
about like there was a passage that I

1405
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,600
found that I think is you know I've been

1406
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,820
doing these podcasts like during kovat

1407
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,280
and and like every week the news is

1408
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,070
crazy different and so it's like so

1409
00:55:56,070 --> 00:56:00,030
today's like June 2nd so we're in kovat

1410
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:02,970
and you know George

1411
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:07,860
Floyd was murdered last week and you

1412
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,830
know all the major cities of the United

1413
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:15,600
States are are uprising right and it's

1414
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:22,850
just like people want justice and I

1415
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,230
remember reading this passage and I was

1416
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:27,150
thinking about and I asked you if you

1417
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,500
wanted to talk about this in in the

1418
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:34,290
light of what's going on and so I'll and

1419
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:36,480
you said that you you would want to talk

1420
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,370
about it and so the passage is how can

1421
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:44,280
you justify if life on one side thinks

1422
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,830
that they're the only way when the other

1423
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:49,530
side is thinking the same justice is not

1424
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:53,670
the solution mercy is I was just like

1425
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:59,250
wow wow and I think and you talk about

1426
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:03,000
that also within I think after that

1427
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,640
passage you talked about the war within

1428
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,130
worlds and the war within words and and

1429
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,780
that's just another so can you just tell

1430
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,340
me a little bit about that kind of whole

1431
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:15,570
passage in that happened that whole line

1432
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:18,900
of thinking and then and maybe thinking

1433
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,760
about like and you're in Minnesota right

1434
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,860
you're in Stillwater I'm super close to

1435
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:27,690
Minneapolis right and so maybe reflect

1436
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:30,960
on if you could reflect on you know this

1437
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,780
passage in what's happening right now

1438
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:36,000
yeah and it is kind of crazy because

1439
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,730
again like

1440
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:39,760
I didn't know a lot of this was going to

1441
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,650
be happening even when I thought I was

1442
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,150
going to start writing this book let

1443
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:44,380
alone going through the editing and

1444
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:48,460
getting it done but I'm I'm still so

1445
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:51,130
torn with like how Americans use

1446
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:54,310
language because so often like the thing

1447
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:55,240
that always gets me in trouble

1448
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,310
especially out here in Minnesota is this

1449
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,870
idea behind sarcasm or passive

1450
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:01,240
aggressiveness which again I don't know

1451
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,300
how the media is portraying at all but

1452
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,070
the way that I see it a lot of times

1453
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:09,010
like our words really do shape our

1454
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:11,920
worlds and specifically with wanting

1455
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:17,500
justice in certain areas of actions that

1456
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,510
have been taken so like this coming from

1457
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:21,700
like an an extraterrestrial who's trying

1458
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,310
to teach her children what it means to

1459
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:28,840
want justice where the rest of the

1460
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,670
universe at this point they don't have

1461
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:32,620
war anymore so there isn't killing of

1462
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:35,560
your own kin and they consider everyone

1463
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,690
kin like yes you have offspring and yes

1464
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:40,630
you have your Guardians but everyone is

1465
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,430
Yin's and Yang's everyone is brothers

1466
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:46,210
and sisters so when they see humans and

1467
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:47,950
we are just different colors it is

1468
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:50,700
really abstract to them to think that

1469
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,480
they don't even come from different

1470
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,340
planets it's literally the same planet

1471
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,560
so how could you ever justify you

1472
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,540
knowing that energy is just recycling

1473
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:01,360
saying that I want justice for what had

1474
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,350
happened in a situation and everyone I I

1475
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:09,190
I love the idea behind it in certain

1476
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:11,530
cases but then especially this last week

1477
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:13,420
like I just feel so torn sometimes

1478
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,220
because I hear people wanting justice

1479
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:18,160
and the way that the protests have been

1480
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,630
going like their suit like the ones that

1481
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:21,400
I've been part of super peaceful like

1482
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,550
even in the situations where like we we

1483
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:26,440
are standing outside of people's houses

1484
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,840
and like where we're putting up like art

1485
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,080
around poles or or there are streamers

1486
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,090
and it's it's just kind of profound

1487
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:35,590
because like you you hear all these

1488
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:38,170
different stories of like literally in

1489
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:40,390
the same city of George Floyd where you

1490
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:42,850
didn't make it on to the news you hear

1491
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:44,920
about these mothers who literally would

1492
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,780
go like month without hearing autopsy

1493
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,850
reports or like being denied even

1494
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:51,099
knowing like where they're they're loved

1495
00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:54,640
one czar and I hear the anger behind

1496
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,849
like the people who have lost loved ones

1497
00:59:57,849 --> 01:00:01,509
but then I'll see posters or I'll see

1498
01:00:01,509 --> 01:00:05,829
other posts about people saying kill and

1499
01:00:05,829 --> 01:00:09,609
it's I I understand wanting people to

1500
01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:12,400
have to go through like the justice

1501
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,499
system and I understand people wanting

1502
01:00:14,499 --> 01:00:18,220
them to be tried and I do understand the

1503
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:21,339
idea of like the death sentence but at

1504
01:00:21,339 --> 01:00:23,559
the same time like what I'm really

1505
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:26,109
recognizing is as much and that's what I

1506
01:00:26,109 --> 01:00:28,299
love that passage as much as we want it

1507
01:00:28,299 --> 01:00:31,869
to be equal what we really want what I

1508
01:00:31,869 --> 01:00:34,479
really believe humans want at the bottom

1509
01:00:34,479 --> 01:00:38,380
of our hearts is fairness and realizing

1510
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,779
that if anyone were to be killed because

1511
01:00:40,779 --> 01:00:42,460
someone else got killed and I'm not

1512
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,410
saying people who have been killed

1513
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:47,589
should not get justice to what is owed

1514
01:00:47,589 --> 01:00:51,400
um I just don't see how people can

1515
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,339
possibly who are upset say that the only

1516
01:00:54,339 --> 01:00:56,650
justice is to then kill other people

1517
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:01,059
because all you're gonna have all you're

1518
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:03,700
gonna have is on the other side their

1519
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:07,450
mothers and their kids and and I know

1520
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,819
that not everyone sees people as equal

1521
01:01:09,819 --> 01:01:12,489
which is a whole taboo thing for me in

1522
01:01:12,489 --> 01:01:16,779
general cuz I I don't understand I I

1523
01:01:16,779 --> 01:01:19,059
came into this world with a black dad

1524
01:01:19,059 --> 01:01:21,960
and a white mom like I don't know like

1525
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:28,059
it just it's it's hard for me to ever

1526
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,729
say that because someone got killed

1527
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:33,400
because someone was very hurt in

1528
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,349
whatever they're going through it

1529
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:37,930
justifies other people saying I want

1530
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:40,509
them to be dead now too because I feel

1531
01:01:40,509 --> 01:01:42,460
like that's what happens in humanity so

1532
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:45,789
often we want what happened to be done

1533
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:48,759
to that person and it's so easy to want

1534
01:01:48,759 --> 01:01:51,489
that and granted I haven't lost someone

1535
01:01:51,489 --> 01:01:53,920
like that so I can only empathize for

1536
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,660
what it means to actually lose a loved

1537
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:58,569
one when it comes to like not having it

1538
01:01:58,569 --> 01:02:02,380
be felt like it was right but if we can

1539
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:04,180
really come together and realize what

1540
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:04,869
humanity

1541
01:02:04,869 --> 01:02:07,539
really wants is mercy more than someone

1542
01:02:07,539 --> 01:02:09,670
having to pay for the cost that they've

1543
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:12,999
already paid like what if instead of

1544
01:02:12,999 --> 01:02:15,999
wanting justice we actually do find a

1545
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:18,759
way to have mercy on those people who

1546
01:02:18,759 --> 01:02:24,730
did wrong and have them come to the

1547
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:26,849
realization because the thing that I

1548
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:29,559
feel so strongly for especially with

1549
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:30,849
like the idea and I know not everyone

1550
01:02:30,849 --> 01:02:33,339
agrees with it but reincarnation because

1551
01:02:33,339 --> 01:02:35,259
one of the biggest things that I do

1552
01:02:35,259 --> 01:02:37,900
agree with with this idea of energy and

1553
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,180
however consciousness gets connected

1554
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:42,390
between like our nerves and and

1555
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:44,980
everything that is around us is energy

1556
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:47,650
cannot be created nor destroyed so when

1557
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:51,039
someone a literal life is destroyed in a

1558
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:53,890
way that is hateful hindering or harmful

1559
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:56,109
to their families to their loved ones

1560
01:02:56,109 --> 01:02:58,509
their lives to their own livelihood I

1561
01:02:58,509 --> 01:03:01,480
feel like when it gets recycled it holds

1562
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:05,019
on to that hate hindrance or harm and it

1563
01:03:05,019 --> 01:03:08,769
comes back in that same order so what if

1564
01:03:08,769 --> 01:03:10,509
before we just decide to destroy

1565
01:03:10,509 --> 01:03:13,269
something that literally has energy what

1566
01:03:13,269 --> 01:03:15,369
if we could find a way to have it become

1567
01:03:15,369 --> 01:03:17,529
aware of why it feels a certain way

1568
01:03:17,529 --> 01:03:19,569
because ending it isn't the solution

1569
01:03:19,569 --> 01:03:22,499
it's just gonna come back so what if as

1570
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:25,720
humanity we are able to discover what it

1571
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,839
means in reality to have us challenge

1572
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:31,930
why we feel justice means you have to

1573
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:34,720
end things justice isn't the end justice

1574
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,309
should be the beginning and the

1575
01:03:36,309 --> 01:03:39,900
beginning really starts with mercy um

1576
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:44,440
yeah so I I don't know I've been to a

1577
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,019
few of these protests now and like I and

1578
01:03:47,019 --> 01:03:49,569
walking around these towns and I am

1579
01:03:49,569 --> 01:03:51,160
really like distraught because like

1580
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,869
granted I've only been here since

1581
01:03:52,869 --> 01:03:55,420
September of last year but half of the

1582
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:57,999
places that are considered icons or like

1583
01:03:57,999 --> 01:04:01,180
establishments for the people are burned

1584
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:04,660
down and destroyed and like I see the I

1585
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:07,390
see the anger but at the same time like

1586
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:10,180
I feel like where most of the hate is

1587
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,430
coming from that's destroying it isn't

1588
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:14,170
even from this city isn't even from

1589
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:17,289
Minnesota it's it's this this idea that

1590
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:18,280
coming

1591
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,830
one else's place and causing more pain

1592
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:24,400
than what is actually even being even

1593
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,010
possible it's it's almost like it wants

1594
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:29,530
to push it to a part where it's not even

1595
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:32,520
seeking justice it's it's trying to I

1596
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,570
don't even know what the word would be

1597
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:36,370
source or like I am kind of at a loss

1598
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:38,410
right now but like it's just recognizing

1599
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:41,800
that if we are saying that we want

1600
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,860
justice and we are on a platform where

1601
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:46,750
people are coming together realizing how

1602
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:49,570
much pain it is I don't know if the

1603
01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:51,610
right thing to come right after that is

1604
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:55,210
to then want a broken system to be the

1605
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:58,060
reason it gets ended like the biggest

1606
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,920
thing that we need to discover is how

1607
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,380
can we have these types of reprimanding

1608
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:05,850
happen outside of the broken system um

1609
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:08,290
because again like from where I'm

1610
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:10,030
standing from and seeing some of these

1611
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:12,760
actions that authority are taking I

1612
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,700
don't know if even if you put it in

1613
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,190
their hands they would know what to do

1614
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,750
because I don't think they know what

1615
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:22,030
anything looks like outside of their

1616
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:27,280
idea of justice yeah yeah yeah thanks

1617
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,190
for sharing all that I vow I mean and I

1618
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:33,550
think you know we have this really

1619
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:36,910
punitive justice justice system where

1620
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:39,760
you know we punish people for for things

1621
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,310
instead of trying versus like a

1622
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:45,190
restorative justice system where you you

1623
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:50,140
try to I mean you don't I mean yeah you

1624
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:51,640
hold people responsible but you don't

1625
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,440
put the blame on them you know that

1626
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,780
they're people and people can make

1627
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:59,320
mistakes and people can people can

1628
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,140
change and people can get get better so

1629
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:04,420
I think a lot of it is within that

1630
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,790
criminal justice system itself but then

1631
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:10,510
we also have this history I mean the

1632
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:13,450
United States has had just I mean

1633
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:18,370
there's just a a crazy long history of

1634
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:23,530
like all of this stuff that we I mean

1635
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:26,860
the racism and has never gone away and

1636
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:31,720
so if we don't acknowledge that like we

1637
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,030
we can't move past it and and and these

1638
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:35,530
things keep happening over and over

1639
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:39,510
again we're stuck on the same channel so

1640
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,820
yeah thanks I mean thank you so much for

1641
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:46,080
sharing all that and I think that that

1642
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:49,900
you have just a ton of insight on this

1643
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:55,300
stuff and I think yeah I mean I think

1644
01:06:55,300 --> 01:07:02,410
that I I agree I think that humans I was

1645
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:06,310
I was just thinking to like I just read

1646
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:09,040
my wife was reading the book just mercy

1647
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:09,820
have you read this book

1648
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:12,700
Wow and it's about like death row and

1649
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:14,470
like all these people on death row and

1650
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:17,490
they've been like and a lot of them were

1651
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:20,710
on death row for a long time and so this

1652
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:21,970
guy I think it's the Innocence Project

1653
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:24,250
know he started a different project when

1654
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,500
he worked with the Innocence Project but

1655
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,240
basically getting people off death row

1656
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,220
that are innocent and like just like all

1657
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:32,250
the wrongs like within the system itself

1658
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:36,040
anyways she on our way back we were up

1659
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:39,520
north for Memorial Day weekend and on

1660
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,099
our way back I read the last three two

1661
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:44,710
pages to her because like she said I'm

1662
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:46,060
not gonna finish my book I'm like I'll

1663
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:47,740
read to you in the car if you drive so

1664
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:49,839
again she can't read when when she

1665
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:53,109
drives how I read it to her and one of

1666
01:07:53,109 --> 01:07:55,420
the things that struck me at the end of

1667
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,160
the book and I'm gonna spoil her so if

1668
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,660
you want to read the book don't listen

1669
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:02,710
to this part but I guess so it doesn't

1670
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:04,750
spoil it but there's this lady that's

1671
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,490
sitting at the courthouse and she's been

1672
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:07,780
going to all these court hearings with

1673
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:09,730
this guy who was an attorney that was

1674
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:13,089
getting all these people off um she she

1675
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,190
gave him a big hug and she was she

1676
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:21,069
called herself a she's a stone a stone

1677
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:22,750
catcher because all these people have

1678
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:25,060
stones all these people that are

1679
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:26,589
fighting for justice have all these

1680
01:08:26,589 --> 01:08:28,149
stones that are getting thrown Adam and

1681
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:32,939
they and and she originally I think her

1682
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:37,238
her son was killed by somebody and she

1683
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:39,488
went she didn't want the person that

1684
01:08:39,488 --> 01:08:41,469
killed her son to get the death penalty

1685
01:08:41,469 --> 01:08:44,529
and so she went and consoled those

1686
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:45,339
families

1687
01:08:45,339 --> 01:08:47,198
those stones and she caught these stones

1688
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:49,270
and so she's like it's hard being a

1689
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:51,040
stone cutter and she hugged the attorney

1690
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,229
who's been catching these stones for

1691
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:55,270
like this is his whole life project like

1692
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:57,639
he's been trying to get people and he's

1693
01:08:57,639 --> 01:09:00,488
dealt with just like crazy and justices

1694
01:09:00,488 --> 01:09:02,948
and like that like that kind of weight

1695
01:09:02,948 --> 01:09:05,948
just weighs on you right and so um I

1696
01:09:05,948 --> 01:09:09,698
think about that and she had the ability

1697
01:09:09,698 --> 01:09:12,609
to forgive that person who killed her

1698
01:09:12,609 --> 01:09:18,189
son and like make that other that other

1699
01:09:18,189 --> 01:09:22,029
family like try to console them and I

1700
01:09:22,029 --> 01:09:24,670
was just like wow what a superhuman

1701
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:27,429
right and and I feel like we need more

1702
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:29,500
superhumans and I think that concept of

1703
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,569
what you're talking about is us being

1704
01:09:31,569 --> 01:09:45,750
superhuman so yeah I mean I think um you

1705
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,189
know we went through a lot here and I

1706
01:09:48,189 --> 01:09:49,960
think is there any other topics that you

1707
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:50,979
want to talk about we had a bunch of

1708
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:53,139
other things that we could potentially

1709
01:09:53,139 --> 01:09:54,489
continue to talk about but I think that

1710
01:09:54,489 --> 01:09:57,849
might be a good place to wrap up but if

1711
01:09:57,849 --> 01:10:01,659
you have any what is that no I think

1712
01:10:01,659 --> 01:10:03,670
that's good it's interesting though

1713
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:05,170
because like I know like you gave me

1714
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:06,099
like a bunch of like I'm gonna do this

1715
01:10:06,099 --> 01:10:08,199
like as quick as I can but I knew you're

1716
01:10:08,199 --> 01:10:10,090
gonna have these types of organic even

1717
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:15,849
our conversation on the podcast know it

1718
01:10:15,849 --> 01:10:17,469
interesting cuz at least for me like

1719
01:10:17,469 --> 01:10:19,330
sometimes when I think about like what

1720
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:22,179
it means to like have conversations with

1721
01:10:22,179 --> 01:10:24,460
people and I I think this is a really

1722
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:26,830
good note to end on like realizing like

1723
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:29,679
how often weed and I consider like an

1724
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:32,409
echo chamber because what I'm hearing

1725
01:10:32,409 --> 01:10:34,060
even like after I said what I said I'm

1726
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,260
like did I say anything that I'm gonna

1727
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:37,150
regret later cuz like right now like I

1728
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,830
am realizing it's such a sensitive type

1729
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:42,400
of conversation and I like that you and

1730
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,380
your wife are people who are reading

1731
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:46,179
other people's stories and reaching out

1732
01:10:46,179 --> 01:10:49,150
and asking people other things because

1733
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:51,580
one thing that I do realize especially

1734
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,460
at this like time and like it be very

1735
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,219
touchy cuz like it's no I don't even to

1736
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:58,959
call the word touchy it's being real

1737
01:10:58,959 --> 01:11:01,150
on subjects that people don't usually

1738
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:03,729
talk about like the fact that we're able

1739
01:11:03,729 --> 01:11:06,130
to talk about magic and aliens and the

1740
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:08,829
idea of forgiving people that most

1741
01:11:08,829 --> 01:11:10,929
people would rather like cast to like

1742
01:11:10,929 --> 01:11:15,280
the fire or or have them be written up

1743
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,150
and it's it's realizing that like

1744
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:23,590
someone everyone who is on this planet

1745
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:26,260
started out as a child as far as I know

1746
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:28,209
everyone started as a child and as far

1747
01:11:28,209 --> 01:11:29,079
as I know

1748
01:11:29,079 --> 01:11:31,329
children do not know hate it is

1749
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:33,939
something that is taught and more than

1750
01:11:33,939 --> 01:11:36,820
that what I'm discovering about people

1751
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:39,459
who look at one side or the next like

1752
01:11:39,459 --> 01:11:42,249
it's not an easy thing to ever admit

1753
01:11:42,249 --> 01:11:43,059
that you're wrong

1754
01:11:43,059 --> 01:11:46,269
so imagine what it's like to know that

1755
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:48,670
you might be wrong when you were trying

1756
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:51,010
to do something that I'd like to say

1757
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:53,409
they were they were doing their job but

1758
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:55,869
at the same time realizing that they did

1759
01:11:55,869 --> 01:11:58,209
something wrong which was against what

1760
01:11:58,209 --> 01:12:00,579
their job is and now knowing how many

1761
01:12:00,579 --> 01:12:03,489
people are angry at them like what are

1762
01:12:03,489 --> 01:12:04,900
the odds they're gonna turn around and

1763
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,289
say whoa I'm wrong I'm so sorry so it's

1764
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:10,239
realizing sometimes like how human we

1765
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,570
can be in moments where we know we are

1766
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:18,340
in just but then also realizing that

1767
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:21,610
this thing about racism and this thing

1768
01:12:21,610 --> 01:12:24,689
about Authority and this thing about

1769
01:12:24,689 --> 01:12:28,659
what is considered safe like it is a

1770
01:12:28,659 --> 01:12:30,639
really profound time that we're in

1771
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:34,260
specifically now during this 20 20 of

1772
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:38,650
our history books because I have no idea

1773
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:40,630
what history is going to look like I

1774
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:43,570
have no idea what is going to be taken

1775
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:46,209
from this time but one thing that I do

1776
01:12:46,209 --> 01:12:48,010
know is these types of conversations

1777
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:51,400
need to be had because what if we are

1778
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,530
able to become that generation that is

1779
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:56,760
able to figure out how to have people

1780
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:01,659
who are so angry by the oppression or so

1781
01:13:01,659 --> 01:13:06,519
upset at the system or not realizing

1782
01:13:06,519 --> 01:13:10,449
what it would be like for everyone to

1783
01:13:10,449 --> 01:13:12,850
actually experience equality on a loved

1784
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:17,920
that isn't just within the government

1785
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,370
system or the governing systems because

1786
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:23,890
even before this like and it's kind of

1787
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:25,600
crazy before this whole last month like

1788
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,640
my biggest worry was actually happening

1789
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,380
with like what was actually going on

1790
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:30,880
with corona like the fact that like

1791
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,350
that's not even a thing right now during

1792
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:35,830
these protests kind of does blow my mind

1793
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:38,560
because it realizes at least in my mind

1794
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,510
it has me realize that like there are

1795
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:42,280
bigger things than me pretending

1796
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,410
pretending that sounds bad there's

1797
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:48,160
bigger things than me protecting what

1798
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:52,420
I'm actually staying inside for and at

1799
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,520
the same time like also realizing that

1800
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:57,520
it's not just what I'm staying inside

1801
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,820
for it's what I'm standing up to in

1802
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,980
these types of moments because like we

1803
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,450
were talking about even before we got on

1804
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:06,580
to this podcast right now it is

1805
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:11,050
recognizing that like how much

1806
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:14,050
involvement do we actually have knowing

1807
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:16,060
that a lot of our ways of communication

1808
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:19,630
right now have been like I don't wanna

1809
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:22,360
say cut but have been like um lesson

1810
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:24,100
because we're not going out as much as

1811
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,350
we do and so like I appreciate you as

1812
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:28,000
someone in my life because source or

1813
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,650
like there are so many things that are

1814
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:31,780
happening right now like at least within

1815
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:34,240
my own self-discovery journey that I'm

1816
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:36,340
not experiencing right now because as

1817
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:39,370
much as I can I'm following the rules

1818
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:41,650
but then realizing how many rules are

1819
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:43,690
set that are not having everyone having

1820
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:46,810
their voices being heard so I appreciate

1821
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:49,960
people like you who even in moments like

1822
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,480
this like you're you're literally like

1823
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,700
the virtual foot soldiers like you're

1824
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:55,750
out there you're making these

1825
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:59,320
conversations happen so yeah this this

1826
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:02,590
is a good stopping point and then at

1827
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:04,390
least for people out there in the cyber

1828
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:06,550
con community and who are thinking about

1829
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:09,130
writing your books and having book ideas

1830
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:12,900
if there's one thing I can give you

1831
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:15,670
write down all the ideas that come to

1832
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:17,740
you especially the ones that come out of

1833
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:20,380
nowhere um because it's important like

1834
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:22,480
like sir Sir I'd mentioned to catch

1835
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,360
those things like I might not be the

1836
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,650
person who's

1837
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:29,500
I'm catching rocks for people who are in

1838
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:33,550
justified or on death row but I am

1839
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:35,800
definitely someone who is realizing that

1840
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,930
these questions and curiosities that

1841
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:39,460
people are having during these times

1842
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:41,260
like they're not actually being talked

1843
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:43,900
about as much and as much as I can I'm

1844
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,430
trying to be that voice because I

1845
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:47,470
realized that some of these messages

1846
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:49,180
that I felt like came to me like these

1847
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,430
last five years like they are something

1848
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:54,640
that are coming out of me more than

1849
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,730
anything and when people are reaching

1850
01:15:57,730 --> 01:16:00,850
out to you as whatever writer you're

1851
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:02,320
going to become for them because you are

1852
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,700
going to have people who are going to

1853
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,080
read your book you are gonna have people

1854
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,700
who are coming to you later with their

1855
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:09,580
book ideas get your ideas out as fast

1856
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:11,140
you can't worry about grammar we're

1857
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:13,960
about editing later because the one

1858
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,630
thing that you can really do is write a

1859
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:19,210
rough construct of whatever your scenes

1860
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:21,490
or points of view look like in your book

1861
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:23,440
without having to be finished later

1862
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,120
editor's will help you I promise you

1863
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,650
you'll find those people because again

1864
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:28,780
you're manifesting what you want to

1865
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:31,210
create in this world and if you like me

1866
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:34,210
I'm not I'm not a music writer I'm not a

1867
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:38,080
podcaster I am NOT an engineer anymore

1868
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,300
I'm an author so what I can do in these

1869
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:44,140
types of moments is right and if you are

1870
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,060
interested in becoming that writer - I

1871
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,830
hope this message reaches you because

1872
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:50,890
like what I was writing this book there

1873
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:52,330
there are moments where you're you're

1874
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:54,700
writing a chapter and you might not know

1875
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,380
what you're gonna put in in that space

1876
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:58,570
and it it might come like a month or

1877
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:00,700
late month or two later like when I was

1878
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,470
writing the commencement speech I

1879
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:05,260
literally just put insert epic speech

1880
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:07,440
then I continued the rest of the chapter

1881
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,370
knowing that it was going to come to me

1882
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:12,100
later but there isn't any right way to

1883
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,410
start whatever project you're taking on

1884
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:17,470
but if you are interested in having your

1885
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:21,040
words be turned in to an external world

1886
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,230
you want to get these thoughts out you

1887
01:17:23,230 --> 01:17:25,420
want to start having these types of

1888
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:27,310
discoveries within yourself because

1889
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:30,250
you're holding them on inside of you get

1890
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:32,170
them out without feeling like it has to

1891
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:34,210
be perfect because perfection just like

1892
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:36,460
timelines they're wibbly-wobbly they

1893
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,290
they they don't they don't always look

1894
01:17:38,290 --> 01:17:40,480
the best the first time through

1895
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,760
um but make sure you catch those ideas

1896
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,160
and you put them down because if this

1897
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,660
world wants you to have them it's

1898
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,970
because they want you to share them echo

1899
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:51,160
those out wait till the echoes come back

1900
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,280
and then just continue the process but

1901
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,420
