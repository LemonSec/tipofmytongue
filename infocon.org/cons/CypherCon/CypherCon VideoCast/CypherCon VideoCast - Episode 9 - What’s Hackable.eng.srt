1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,439
hey ted

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,240
welcome back to the podcast thanks for

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,400
having me kyle thanks for having me

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,240
um i know the the last time you were on

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,759
the podcast we talked a lot about

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,480
the the research that uh you and your

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,360
company did

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,160
and uh you know since then you've taken

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,560
some of that research and put it into

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,600
a book called uh hackable and really

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,960
talked about how

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,920
you can use some of these uh security

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,840
concepts

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,079
um and uh yeah so i just wanted to kind

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:32,558
of

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,399
you know for folks that want to go back

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,600
and listen to

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,000
the uh the first podcast we did it's

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,280
episode 10

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,879
and we talked a lot about the research

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,040
that you did and um

22
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,039
just for folks that maybe haven't

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,160
listened to that one if you could just

24
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,600
give out the kind of overview about you

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,000
know

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,680
you and what your what your company is

27
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,239
yeah so my name is ted harrington i'm

28
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,280
one of the partners

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,079
of a security consulting and security

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,280
research company called

31
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,520
independent security evaluators and

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,559
we're like

33
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,959
the good guy hackers all right we're the

34
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,640
ones that companies come to and say

35
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,320
hey come break our stuff before the bad

36
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,720
guy does and and fix it

37
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,920
and so as as a result of that you know

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,400
of course

39
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,080
how we make money is companies hire us

40
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
but we also publish a lot of research

41
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,600
it's essentially the same thing

42
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,360
except that uh we're doing it to publish

43
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,799
it we're not getting paid for it

44
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,720
and so that's uh along the lines of what

45
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,479
you're alluding to and some of our

46
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,479
research is we've hacked everything from

47
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,439
cars to smartphones to medical devices

48
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,799
cryptocurrency wallets

49
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,320
and uh yeah like like you mentioned i um

50
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,360
i decided to write a book and when you

51
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,880
write a book you want to tell stories

52
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,000
and so i just tell

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,880
all these stories from research and

54
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,720
stories from our customers too of course

55
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,759
without naming names but that's that's

56
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,000
who i am i i help companies build better

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,680
more secure software

58
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
and and why write a book so why did why

59
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,360
did you take all this and go

60
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,000
through the the rigor and the

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,360
painstaking uh

62
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,880
or maybe it wasn't painstakingly maybe

63
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,079
it was fun for you but maybe you could

64
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,759
just talk a little bit about that

65
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,280
you know the why and then the process of

66
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,000
writing the book how was it

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,400
yeah it's funny that's the second time

68
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,480
today that someone's actually asked me

69
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,120
why write about this super technical

70
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,239
idea

71
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,280
in a very analog format which is a book

72
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,680
and it's it's a really good question

73
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,760
the reason why i wanted to write it in a

74
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,800
book is

75
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
that uh smart people read books

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,720
and i'm trying to meet people the smart

77
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,000
people where they are right

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,599
and so i wrote a book to help people who

79
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,599
are trying to level up their

80
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,640
security game their their understanding

81
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:44,959
of

82
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,519
you know how systems work and and how to

83
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,160
break them and all that stuff and so

84
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,200
when i decided that i was the

85
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,040
i guess the moment that made me decide

86
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,879
it was i really observed

87
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,640
sort of two things first thing i

88
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,839
observed was that

89
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,879
every conversation that i had with

90
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,239
whether it's a current customer a

91
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,000
prospective customer or just

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,360
people that i talk to at industry

93
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,280
conferences or just you know

94
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,599
other parts of my life it seems like

95
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,120
when it comes to security

96
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,400
everyone had really essentially the same

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,200
10 problems and not everyone would

98
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,319
necessarily say

99
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,480
all 10 of them every time but every

100
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,239
conversation someone had one or more of

101
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,360
these problems was what they were

102
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,560
struggling with

103
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,480
and when i first noted that i realized

104
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,599
that you know that's that's pretty

105
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,080
interesting

106
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,519
i'll have to think about that and then

107
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,599
as i was thinking about those problems

108
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,959
and the solutions to those problems

109
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,560
i noticed something else and what i

110
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,799
noticed was that the the conventional

111
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,640
solutions to those problems that

112
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,760
everybody has

113
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,920
the conventional solutions are almost

114
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,560
entirely wrong

115
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,319
that was the moment that sort of kicked

116
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,480
my butt into gear to say look you

117
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,239
i said this by myself like i know how to

118
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,840
solve these problems

119
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,280
and i i see it as a

120
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,760
itself a problem almost a tragedy that

121
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,720
the people who

122
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,159
know they have a problem and want to

123
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,560
solve that problem are being given

124
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,760
advice

125
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,840
that is bad advice so i wrote this book

126
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,760
to correct that whole situation

127
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,880
and when you start i think from that

128
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,918
position of service right which is i can

129
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,759
help someone solve their problem

130
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,680
what follows the writing process is

131
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,040
actually not

132
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,960
i mean it's hard it's it's tremendously

133
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,639
hard and it takes a ton of work

134
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,560
but it's not like uh it's not unpleasant

135
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,160
it's actually a lot of benefits come out

136
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,840
of it throughout the process

137
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,520
that's great i like i like taking that

138
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,440
uh approach that you know you're being

139
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,680
of service and really helping people

140
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,560
figure out what their problems are and

141
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,199
how to

142
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,000
best solve them now what are you just

143
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,800
mentioned that

144
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,479
you know a lot of these companies that

145
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,880
you help they have a lot of similar

146
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,800
things you found some patterns with

147
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,400
you know some of these prospective

148
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,320
customers what what are some of those

149
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
patterns what are some of those uh

150
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
typical things that you you saw with uh

151
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,479
with customers that kind of got you

152
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,759
thinking about how you could put these

153
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,520
into into a book

154
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,840
they there's a handful right uh so

155
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,440
they're things like

156
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,199
one of the challenges is that people

157
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,720
don't necessarily know

158
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
sort of what the right mindset or right

159
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,400
approach or right attitude

160
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,160
is to approach security and this is one

161
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,840
of those things where people sometimes

162
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,720
don't even necessarily

163
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,199
state that as a problem it's inherent

164
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,039
and implied in the way that they

165
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,440
think about the problems another

166
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,639
challenge is people don't necessarily

167
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,080
know how to work with

168
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,479
security consultants they don't know how

169
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,360
to vet them

170
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,120
or how to pick between them or even once

171
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,880
they are working with one

172
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,600
how to think about information like for

173
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,039
example a lot of people

174
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,479
think that what's called black box

175
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,160
testing is this great thing because they

176
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,720
think it

177
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,320
is like oh it's like emulating the

178
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,240
attacker it's like real world conditions

179
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,759
but it's it's actually none of those

180
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,639
things it

181
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,039
it delivers all these bad things like it

182
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,199
makes your partner really inefficient

183
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,759
uh i saw issues where people struggle

184
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,000
with understanding how much to spend

185
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,800
what to spend it on when you're spending

186
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,960
that money what are the efforts that it

187
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,479
goes towards how do you fix

188
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,479
issues how fast should you or how

189
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,919
frequently should you

190
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,919
look at security again and then really

191
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,280
the big one the big

192
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,880
sort of the the big kahuna is

193
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,919
what's the business benefit right

194
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,000
look i'm a security guy of course i and

195
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,600
i'm an optimist

196
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,680
i believe that security is a value

197
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,680
on its own like it's worth doing because

198
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,960
it's the right thing to do and i

199
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,680
i genuinely believe that about security

200
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,360
but i'm also a pragmatist

201
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,479
and i realize that no business is going

202
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,440
to do anything

203
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,680
just because it's the right thing to do

204
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,000
uh now

205
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,680
without wait let's not pick that apart

206
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,599
in terms of like well what about

207
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,800
defrauding their cost you know that's

208
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,479
not my point my point is like people

209
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:56,960
aren't

210
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
uh people don't start commercial

211
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,400
for-profit enterprises

212
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,000
to just do things that like that feels

213
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,759
right there what they're trying to do is

214
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,080
pursue their mission and a lot of people

215
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,520
think about security as this

216
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
like tax on the business they think of

217
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,560
it as well

218
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,199
how do we minimize this cost that is

219
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,840
security

220
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,680
and that is a problem because

221
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,919
actually what security is is it's a

222
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,120
differentiator

223
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,520
it's a competitive advantage and when

224
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,120
it's done right and it's used right

225
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,560
you're able to actually

226
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,319
use it in your sales and marketing

227
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,319
process and most people don't know how

228
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,039
to do

229
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,840
that at all let alone that it's

230
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,599
something they can do and so

231
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,800
you know you hear these things enough

232
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,120
over and over you're like i can solve

233
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,520
that

234
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,039
and that's and essentially i structured

235
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,039
the book around

236
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,120
the there's ten chapters in the book and

237
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,400
the first nine chapters are

238
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,080
here's how to essentially do security

239
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
right like here's how to think about

240
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,639
your relationship with your partner

241
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,840
here's the right mindset

242
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,919
here's the right methodology here's what

243
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,599
testing should look like here's how to

244
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:55,919
fix

245
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,160
issues here's how to deal with change

246
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,759
here's how to build security and here's

247
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,720
how to

248
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,879
um set your budgets or think about your

249
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,319
budgets and then

250
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,840
so that's the first nine chapters how to

251
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,680
do security right and then the

252
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,120
uh the tenth chapter is how do you prove

253
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,720
it because then if you can prove it

254
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,599
people will buy from you i love it and

255
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,199
that really resonated with me when i was

256
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,120
reading this book so i'm a product owner

257
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,599
on the product side of things and

258
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,120
you know i have an awareness of security

259
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,639
but i don't necessarily know

260
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,560
the technical details of a lot of the

261
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,240
security stuff so it was really

262
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,880
eye-opening for me to to read this book

263
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,120
and i really like that you take that

264
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,000
approach to you know rather than saying

265
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,519
and like a lot of people like you said

266
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,559
like a lot of people will

267
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,080
do security it's like okay i gotta check

268
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,480
these boxes rather than

269
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,959
bringing that as a part of your

270
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,120
development to make a product and

271
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,200
and really having really solid security

272
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,320
gives you a competitive advantage to the

273
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
you know your competitors and really

274
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,519
helps you deliver that

275
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,480
really amazing product and so how do you

276
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,279
go about

277
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,360
um you know pitching that to

278
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,680
executives who you know like like you

279
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,839
said they're really focused on

280
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,800
you know um the bottom line you know

281
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,480
they're focused on uh

282
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,160
what their mission is for the business

283
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,680
and and um

284
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,519
you know at the end of the day making

285
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,040
making money so

286
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,160
um how how do you

287
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,640
how do you approach that to you know

288
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,279
executives

289
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,640
well i guess i guess there's three

290
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,040
things to do so one is tell stories

291
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,519
because storytelling is really uh it's

292
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,120
how we as humans

293
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,959
actually consume information and can

294
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,040
figure out how to take action on it so

295
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,120
i tell a lot of stories in this book but

296
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,480
uh telling stories

297
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,080
about companies who did it right and

298
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,560
companies who did not do it right

299
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,680
the second is provide

300
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,480
data but minimal on the data and so this

301
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,120
is

302
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,959
something i think that's kind of

303
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,800
surprising to a lot of people in a very

304
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,560
scientific field like security

305
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,040
or more broadly in technology that even

306
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,399
though we all love data we love

307
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,160
analyzing it we love looking at trends

308
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,480
and

309
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,120
stuff data no one makes decisions even

310
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,160
though we're all like give me the data

311
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,360
so i make a decision now we make

312
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,959
decisions on emotion

313
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,680
and based on essentially storytelling

314
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,519
and so what the data needs to do

315
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,640
is to support the argument that you make

316
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,760
in a story so

317
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,279
when you want to convince an executive

318
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,959
something you tell them a story

319
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,720
that helps them understand how that they

320
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,160
can see themselves in the story and they

321
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,839
can see the success or the failure that

322
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,959
might result

323
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,760
use data to support it and then you tell

324
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,920
them exactly what to do

325
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,800
in crystal clear terms literally do this

326
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,600
do this

327
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,519
and do this no don't beat around the

328
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,240
bush like be super clear and succinct

329
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,040
and finally tell them what the outcome

330
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
is that they will get

331
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,279
and that's how decisions are made by

332
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,160
executives

333
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,399
they will uh you know they understand

334
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,279
the data to make sure that what they are

335
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,360
assessing about the situation actually

336
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,200
makes sense they want to know exactly

337
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,079
what to do

338
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,200
and then they want to know what they're

339
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,760
going to get if they do that thing

340
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,640
yeah makes it you make it sound so easy

341
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,959
and i'm wondering how

342
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,200
how was it like you know because and

343
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,160
that's something that you do well in

344
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,920
this book i think it is uh

345
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,440
and the book is called hackable i don't

346
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,959
think we talked about the name of the

347
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,880
book yet so it's hackable

348
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,839
and uh so so and you do a good job of

349
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,640
that this book

350
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,800
of writing really clear stories and

351
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,839
analogies and

352
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,480
and you you know uh putting things in a

353
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,399
way that anyone can understand it

354
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,519
uh how did you um

355
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,279
how was that process for you is it was

356
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,200
it easy for you to

357
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,800
make it succinct and you know easy to

358
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,519
understand or was there a lot of editing

359
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,399
involved like

360
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,920
how what was that process like

361
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,880
that is not easy one of the things that

362
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,000
i i've been saying

363
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,760
to people that i've learned from this is

364
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,079
that it's really

365
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,519
hard to write simple

366
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,519
you know you're like well that sentence

367
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,800
only has four words

368
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,120
and this one has like 25 words you're

369
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,399
telling me that one's harder right it's

370
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,320
like yeah that's way harder to write the

371
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,399
the four word sentence

372
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,680
and so that that was really hard um it

373
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,600
did require a tremendous amount of

374
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,880
editing

375
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,680
but here's the trick to it so uh like i

376
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,000
could

377
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,320
give you all the sort of like mechanical

378
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,160
and technical sides of how you actually

379
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,600
edit a manuscript

380
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,360
but the part that i think's really

381
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,720
interesting

382
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,360
is how do you make written word

383
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,480
sound easy to understand

384
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,040
you do that by making it sound like

385
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,120
you're talking to somebody

386
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
and that's really difficult too so it's

387
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
like okay well the answer is this really

388
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,160
hard thing

389
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,720
so how's that helpful well the way that

390
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,440
you do that

391
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,800
is you you envision someone that you're

392
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,320
talking to so in my case

393
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,680
i wrote my book talking to my nephew

394
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,079
who's

395
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,920
uh he was 12 turned 13 through the

396
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,560
process so he's a young he's you know a

397
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,680
smart

398
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,200
interested curious kid and

399
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
thinking that how do i describe this to

400
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,040
him knowing that he's not the audience

401
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,560
for the book it's not this isn't a 13

402
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,839
this book is for

403
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,880
professionals in technology but if it

404
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,040
can make sense to a 13 year old

405
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,200
it will make sense to the executives and

406
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,320
they'll thank me

407
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,560
for it being easier to understand

408
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,000
because it's simple no one wants to work

409
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,600
harder than you have to understand

410
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,800
you want it to be easier so once

411
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,600
i was thinking about like i'm gonna

412
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,480
write this

413
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,240
as if i'm speaking to my nephew that

414
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,760
makes a lot of the writing decisions a

415
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,199
little easier so for example

416
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,360
you know i might say something like i

417
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,800
can't remember now what the more complex

418
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,120
ways i might say something would be but

419
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,399
here's the perfect example perfect

420
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,880
example someone asked me this yesterday

421
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,199
they said uh

422
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,360
i'm not making this up they go they're

423
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,320
like ted

424
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,320
tell us how does machine learning and

425
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,839
artificial intelligence

426
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,399
impact digital transformation and the

427
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,000
way that it will make us think about big

428
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,800
data and

429
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,480
how do we synthesize all of this in

430
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,160
order to empower our stakeholders to

431
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,480
take action i'm like

432
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,240
what so i think about a sentence like

433
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,839
that which is like all jargon and

434
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:18,959
buzzwords

435
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,480
corporate lingo and the question is

436
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,120
ted how do we deal with change

437
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,760
my nephew can understand that right i

438
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,880
can understand that

439
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,720
the executives in the boardroom can

440
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,920
understand that and that's

441
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,480
that's really hard to really simplify

442
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,880
what it is that you're trying to say

443
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,160
um but if you do that then what you're

444
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,360
able to do is you're able to take your

445
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,079
message and

446
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,079
actually make impact because if the

447
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,760
reader has to think too hard and they're

448
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,399
like

449
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,560
i'm not entirely sure what he means here

450
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,160
okay we'll just keep going and all you

451
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,079
just lost the opportunity to help that

452
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,000
person solve their problems

453
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,480
wow i love that that's uh that's a good

454
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,920
that's a great tip and and i

455
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,279
and i asked from a personal uh you know

456
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,199
level because i i've been thinking about

457
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,880
writing a book i've had ideas for books

458
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,920
but then just like

459
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,000
never got into the like okay i'm gonna

460
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,440
get you know like

461
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,519
really go all in and do it so i've been

462
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,199
dabbling and you know at some point i

463
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,480
think i'll write one so

464
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,000
thanks for that that's really really

465
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,160
great advice um

466
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,760
i wanted to dig into something else that

467
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,680
you mentioned about you know companies

468
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,000
that

469
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,680
do it right versus companies that don't

470
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,920
do it right are there any examples that

471
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,479
you can share

472
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,319
i have a whole book full of examples

473
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,240
yeah so here's what's interesting is

474
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,600
that the companies

475
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,800
the stories of other companies that

476
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,880
don't do it right are way more

477
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,079
interesting

478
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,560
because they're so dramatic and the

479
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,600
companies do it right it's like

480
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,199
they were supposed to do x they did x

481
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,680
it's like that's the story but i can't i

482
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,320
can tell you

483
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,000
i'll tell you some contrasting stories i

484
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,839
do have a good fail and a good success

485
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,279
story

486
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,279
so where we should focus the story let's

487
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,120
focus on mindset because i think that

488
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,920
this is one of those

489
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,079
areas that is sort of overlooked a lot

490
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:08,959
of people think like

491
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,320
security security it doesn't matter how

492
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,240
i think about it but that's like saying

493
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,920
like fitness is fitness it doesn't

494
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,440
matter how i think about it no it

495
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,800
it matters like if you want to get fit

496
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,759
you're probably gonna be in good shape

497
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,920
and if you're like

498
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,440
show me the list of push-ups i have to

499
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,519
do and i'll do those push-ups today and

500
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,560
that's it

501
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,839
you know like you're not going to get

502
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,160
right it's all about your attitude so

503
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
um there's one company that we worked

504
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,279
with

505
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,519
that makes a medical device that injects

506
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,279
drugs into your spine now that's a

507
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,959
let's just let's just set that as a

508
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,000
baseline of what we're talking about

509
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,480
here

510
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,720
so we had done this security assessment

511
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,000
for this customer

512
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,279
and we were um at the end of the

513
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,279
project we were doing what's called a

514
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,880
results presentation we essentially just

515
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,360
walk

516
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,639
the customer through the different

517
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,639
issues that we found helping them

518
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,240
make really making sure they understand

519
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,519
the problem so they can fix them because

520
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,880
that's that's our mission right we want

521
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,119
to

522
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,640
make sure that people do something with

523
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,839
this and can be better and all that

524
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,039
stuff

525
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,959
so we're we're walking the whole team

526
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,720
of our customer through the issues and

527
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,079
the ceo

528
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,599
interrupts and he says it that's not

529
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,640
that big of a deal

530
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,000
and uh we're like please you know

531
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,240
elaborate explain why this isn't a

532
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,919
problem we had literally just showed him

533
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,640
how an attacker could attack the

534
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,000
software that operates

535
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,160
this device and then as a result it

536
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,840
would actually hurt or potentially kill

537
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840
patients so this is kind of a big deal

538
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,280
if you could actually do that

539
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,440
and his answer was he says look even

540
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,559
though what you say could happen

541
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,840
i'm just not that worried about it

542
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,960
doesn't mean that it will happen and

543
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,160
again we're like

544
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,760
okay i just showed you this is a really

545
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,440
bad scenario so elaborate he says look

546
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,000
let me

547
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,200
let me put it this way he says i drive a

548
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,559
bmw

549
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,120
and i love this car i never want to see

550
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,640
it get scratched and he says

551
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,320
theoretically someone could take a piano

552
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,840
haul it onto the roof of our office

553
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,679
building throw it off onto my car and

554
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,120
completely destroy it

555
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,080
but i'm just not that worried about that

556
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,640
no

557
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,440
my mind was blown you know this guy he

558
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,960
we had just explained to him how someone

559
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,520
could

560
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,000
hurt a patient as a result of using his

561
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,039
his system

562
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,520
and his answer was to come up with these

563
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,200
think that it was similar to a very

564
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,160
far-fetched

565
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,480
like unreasonable scenario and you know

566
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,000
it was it was a bummer because we

567
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,280
couldn't really change his mind we

568
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,559
couldn't turn him around what he really

569
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,559
wanted us to do was sort of just

570
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,440
revise what the report actually said and

571
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,200
so it just sort of that was kind of the

572
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,760
end of it

573
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,600
and the sad story uh the story had a sad

574
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,960
ending

575
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,160
when later he went to go get approval

576
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,720
by the government agency the fda that

577
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,640
approves medical devices for use on

578
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,440
patients

579
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,039
and they started talking about security

580
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,320
and they were like well tell us about

581
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,520
your security flaws and

582
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,760
how you plan to fix them and basically

583
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,200
he tried to shut it he tried to do the

584
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,960
same thing he did to us try to like

585
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,480
well it's not a big deal he tried to

586
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,720
sort of marginalize and dismiss it and

587
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,640
they didn't really like that and so the

588
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,799
product ultimately wasn't approved

589
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,799
and if you don't have fda's approval you

590
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,640
can't sell the product so

591
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,200
the company went out of business now

592
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,240
that's really bad and

593
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,320
i don't mean to i'm not celebrating that

594
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
failure i don't mean to gloat and i hope

595
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,720
that

596
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
that's not what i'm conveying but it

597
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,320
needs to be this cautionary tale needs

598
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,720
to be

599
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,120
shared right here's someone who who just

600
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,520
didn't want to get better and so they

601
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,880
didn't get better and

602
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,559
so it ended badly so

603
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,799
that's how to do it not right yeah you

604
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,080
don't if you think about it

605
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,080
bury your head in the sand when the

606
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,679
evidence is there in front of you you

607
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,160
have to

608
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,520
act on it right yeah you have to i mean

609
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:47,760
and

610
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,520
and this person was i i really feel for

611
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,480
this company and

612
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,440
the ceo because he started from the

613
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,160
right place

614
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,600
right he said let me get an outside

615
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,039
organization let me get people who are

616
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,200
really good at this and yeah it's going

617
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,640
to cost me time and it's going to cost

618
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,000
me money and

619
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,600
it's gonna result in work but let's do

620
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,880
it like that's where they started from

621
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,840
they wouldn't have hired us

622
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,120
if they weren't already demonstrating

623
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,320
those characteristics those are great

624
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,840
characteristics everyone should think

625
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,120
that way

626
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,799
but when the rubber met the road when it

627
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,039
said okay now you gotta fix your stuff

628
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,960
i think that's where that's where it

629
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,159
really fell apart because i think what

630
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,440
they were really hoping was a we

631
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,880
wouldn't find anything or b we would

632
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,200
just

633
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,520
sort of rubber stamp it and be like yeah

634
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,480
this is good

635
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,000
which like which wasn't at all what

636
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,120
we're you know what we're there to do

637
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,760
but we have another customer who sort of

638
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,120
had the opposite and

639
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,640
so now we can look you know flip the

640
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,000
coin to the other side and say okay what

641
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,760
about someone who does it right

642
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,480
and this was a company who's whose story

643
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,600
is like i said a little bit less

644
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,039
dramatic but still pretty cool

645
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,400
they uh they were they realized that

646
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,840
security really mattered to their

647
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,679
customers they worked in an industry

648
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,080
where

649
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,640
the people they were selling to really

650
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,000
prioritize security

651
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,120
and so even though they were a small

652
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,400
company they didn't have a lot of money

653
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,600
didn't have a lot of people they still

654
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,400
invested

655
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,440
to do it right and they went big and and

656
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,559
by big i just mean

657
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,679
they they covered the full attack uh

658
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,520
the full scope of attack services which

659
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,280
is what what they should do and not

660
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,640
everyone can do it but in this case they

661
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,280
did

662
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,320
and they over time they were able to

663
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,000
find all these issues and fix them and

664
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,360
keep getting the product to be better

665
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,760
and

666
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,960
and that was really a big difference

667
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,880
right they said once they got the the

668
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,840
flaws

669
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,120
they went and took action on it they

670
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,320
fixed it they made sure that their

671
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,760
developers were getting better as a

672
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,960
result

673
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,799
and you know fast forward a few years

674
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,520
later they wind up getting acquired for

675
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,120
an enormous like nine figures and

676
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,640
you look at these two stories side by

677
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,400
side i should mention by the way that

678
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,520
they didn't get acquired just because

679
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,280
they were secure they obviously had

680
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,880
everything that made sense for them

681
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,760
to be acquired but they were only in the

682
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,400
game

683
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,240
because they could prove security there

684
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,600
were other options that could have been

685
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,039
acquired as well who were who couldn't

686
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,960
prove security and so the acquiring

687
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,720
entity was like yeah we want you guys

688
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,320
and so now compare those two stories

689
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,280
right one went out of business

690
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,559
one produced millionaires and that's

691
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,520
pretty extreme

692
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,840
right but that really shows you how this

693
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,799
thing that seems

694
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,720
like that shouldn't matter we're talking

695
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,000
about this like

696
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,480
technical scientific thing no mindset

697
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,320
matters and it really is

698
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,400
that big of a difference in terms of the

699
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,840
impact to the business

700
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,960
is how you think about it wow

701
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,799
wow thanks for thanks for sharing the

702
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,640
stories i think that's uh

703
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
yeah it's really great to see i mean

704
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,760
it's a really

705
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,280
you know those are obviously two

706
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,880
completely different ways of looking at

707
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,679
security and

708
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,640
it does make a difference on how you you

709
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,120
you

710
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,240
react to that information how you take

711
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,840
take that mindset and take that approach

712
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,600
to security

713
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,760
um one of the things that i really liked

714
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,720
uh in your

715
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,360
in in your book and you talked about uh

716
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,400
and you really

717
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,840
um for me you really kind of took

718
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,039
like what the probabilities are in

719
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,440
uh being able to figure out what a

720
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,600
private key for a cryptocurrency wallet

721
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:05,919
is

722
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,480
and you know i think you use imagine

723
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,840
you're on a beach

724
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,960
and you know you you have a

725
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,360
grain of sand what's the probability

726
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,120
that your friend could go to the beach

727
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,000
and pick up that same grain of sand and

728
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,480
then

729
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,720
multiply that times all the beaches on

730
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,080
the planet and all

731
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,600
and let's say i can't remember how many

732
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,120
planets there are that have that are

733
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,039
earth-like that have those speeches

734
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,960
and the likelihood of you picking up

735
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,320
that same grain of sand is like the

736
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,000
likelihood of figuring out

737
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,799
you know what a cryptocurrency private

738
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,919
key is

739
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,200
yet you were able to figure it out on

740
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,159
these 752 different keys along with this

741
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:44,480
uh

742
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,120
bitcoin bandit as you described them

743
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,919
that was

744
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,679
able to take out millions of dollars out

745
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,840
of these cryptocurrency wallets

746
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,360
um how does that happen

747
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,840
uh i was really riveted listening to you

748
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,720
tell my own story back to me and how how

749
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,159
did you i was like

750
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,200
damn this guy knows what's up

751
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,520
oh man that was that was cool that was

752
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,360
cool for me

753
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,760
tell me more tell me about chapter one

754
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,480
now

755
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,039
oh man i can't even know what your

756
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,960
what was the question how does that

757
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,480
happen how does how do you

758
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,039
how do you discover you know how do you

759
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,240
in in theoretic

760
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,000
theoretically you should never that

761
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,279
should never happen right you should

762
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,640
never be able to pick up that grain of

763
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,960
sand but you've done it 752 times

764
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,200
like how yeah so the

765
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,960
maybe the bet there's a couple ways to

766
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,640
answer that question we could like

767
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,880
dive deep into the technical way or stay

768
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,679
at the

769
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,880
conceptual level i think staying at the

770
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,000
conceptual level is probably better

771
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,360
because there's a whole white paper that

772
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,039
someone can read who wants to get into

773
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,880
the actual nitty-gritty of how we did it

774
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,840
but i think the the the how does that

775
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,640
happen

776
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,559
it's from this this mindset of

777
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,159
looking at the way that a system is

778
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,840
supposed to work

779
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,799
and then evaluate can it work

780
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,000
differently

781
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,080
i mean that's fundamentally that's

782
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,360
hacking

783
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,960
now and of course that term we should

784
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,720
probably mention is uh

785
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,840
is a bit abused in the media you know

786
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,400
a lot of people come to refer to that as

787
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,520
bad people

788
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,520
um all that a hacker is is someone who

789
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,559
looks at a system

790
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,159
it's creative problem solver and says

791
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,200
hey can i make it do something

792
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,360
differently than it was intended to do

793
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,159
and you know like the classic show

794
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,679
macgyver when he would

795
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,840
fix an engine with a paper clip you know

796
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,520
that's hacking right the paper clip

797
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,799
wasn't designed to be an

798
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,360
engine fixing thing you know that was

799
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,400
that was taking something and

800
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,360
repurposing it

801
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,640
and that's what hacking is so whether

802
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,400
you're talking about

803
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
hackers who are motivated to do good

804
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,159
like ethical hackers people like us and

805
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:48,960
our peers

806
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,120
or attackers who are motivated to do bad

807
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,400
they're both hackers

808
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,159
and so then what a hacker's doing is

809
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,200
they're looking at a system and they're

810
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,960
saying okay well

811
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,440
it has this capability can that

812
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
capability do something else and

813
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,360
uh essentially without getting too into

814
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,720
the weeds on it the

815
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
the sort of the what if questions that

816
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,400
we're asking that's that's the uh

817
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,720
that's the arsenal in the arsenal of the

818
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,880
uh the hackers toolkit is the what if

819
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,000
questions like what if

820
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,880
flank uh the what-if question there was

821
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,679
looking at

822
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,600
uh some things related to um errors

823
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,039
and so looking at how

824
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,640
the the software handled errors

825
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,600
and um basically what what we looked at

826
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,640
was we found

827
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,159
that in so doing it that process

828
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,480
is what we found a way to abuse and

829
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,840
that's also what the

830
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,799
the blockchain bandit who stole millions

831
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,240
of dollars from this

832
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,039
this particular exploit sequence that

833
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,279
was leveraging the same thing we found

834
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,640
you know that's what they also had

835
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,240
discovered so that's that's essentially

836
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,919
it looking at a system and saying

837
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,360
look supposed to do this thing what if

838
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,960
it does this other thing and then just

839
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,559
trial and error until you find something

840
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,799
that you can uh exploit

841
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,840
huh interesting interesting so it was on

842
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,520
the the error handling piece of it

843
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,039
that's interesting

844
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,200
um so something else that you mentioned

845
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,799
about is you know a lot of people are

846
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,480
like all right black box testing right

847
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,039
try to

848
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,960
try to try to hack my [ __ ] and try to

849
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,480
get in try to get in

850
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,440
and um and you kind of caution people

851
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,080
against

852
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,240
just doing black box testing can you

853
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,200
talk a little bit about that

854
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,360
i would say i did more than caution i i

855
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
think i

856
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,440
i i think i made a uh an academic case

857
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,840
against it

858
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,200
except in select uh use cases um yeah so

859
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,919
okay

860
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,760
black box testing yeah that's that's a

861
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,279
good question so this goes to

862
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,240
methodology

863
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,760
i mentioned that one of the problems

864
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,000
that people have whether they know it or

865
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,360
they don't know it

866
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,559
is how do you actually work

867
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,279
with or security consultant your

868
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,240
security partner

869
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,000
whoever you're having doing your testing

870
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,200
and a lot of companies have this

871
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,960
misplaced notion

872
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,399
that they want black box testing because

873
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,320
what black box testing is this is about

874
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,840
withholding information

875
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,880
it's about saying um what what people

876
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,480
are thinking with blackbox testing

877
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,039
they're saying

878
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,640
well what i want to do is i want to have

879
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,960
the attacker try to break into my system

880
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,000
so if i hire

881
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,799
somebody to to evaluate that why don't i

882
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,360
just

883
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,279
like recreate what an attacker would

884
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,159
have so just see can they break in

885
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,880
but that's that's pretty dumb for a lot

886
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,679
of reasons

887
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,000
and the reasons are a few so the first

888
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,600
reason is

889
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,840
you're literally paying them you're

890
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,520
paying your security partner to learn

891
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,039
the things you already know

892
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,279
so i use the metaphor that i like to use

893
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,640
as a castle and so it's like

894
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,480
if a king said hey i want to know if my

895
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,080
enemies can assassinate me

896
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,600
i will ask one of my you know one of the

897
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,039
the nobles in my kingdom to send their

898
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,399
knights and see if they can break in but

899
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,279
i'm not going to tell them anything

900
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,159
about it

901
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,000
and so now every minute that those

902
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,279
knights are spending

903
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,240
trying to like break into his castle

904
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,279
they're doing things like

905
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,520
they're counting the alligators in the

906
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,360
moat they're looking how many archers

907
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,960
are up on the turrets

908
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,720
what's the easiest place to cross the

909
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,960
moat these are things the king already

910
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,080
knows

911
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,279
what what did the king get by paying

912
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,520
somebody to go do the things he already

913
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,520
knew he didn't get anything

914
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,559
and that's another problem

915
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,039
is that what you're really testing

916
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,240
you're not testing your defenses the

917
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,919
king's not testing the castle

918
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,360
the king's testing those nights because

919
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,360
really what the test says is can these

920
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,559
knights in

921
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,480
this amount of time get into this castle

922
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,480
okay what does that tell you about your

923
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,919
enemies like

924
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,360
not really anything and then the final

925
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:45,840
issue

926
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,760
is that you don't know what to

927
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,919
do with the information right you don't

928
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,600
know if they come back and the knights

929
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,240
say hey

930
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,480
you know we saw some stuff but we

931
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,159
couldn't really get to the king

932
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,320
um of the stuff that we saw we didn't

933
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,200
know how to fix it

934
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,279
right uh for example the archers weren't

935
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,440
very accurate

936
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,200
well is that because the archers have

937
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,600
poor equipment is it because there's

938
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,360
the footing where they're standing is

939
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,039
bad is it because they're training

940
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,799
they're not properly trained

941
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,000
is it because that wasn't even the

942
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,520
archer shooting the arrows because the

943
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,320
the actual archers were somewhere else

944
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,640
you don't know because the king didn't

945
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,679
tell them any

946
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,799
information but if instead they the king

947
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,760
had walked them around

948
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,600
and said okay here's the moat here's how

949
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,880
many alligators are in the moat

950
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,799
here's my archers you'll you'll notice

951
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,960
that this is their first day of training

952
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,559
uh the the knights could quickly without

953
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,919
testing anything say well you're gonna

954
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:42,960
want to train your knights

955
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,679
and you need more alligators that took

956
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:46,640
two seconds

957
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,159
and that's the kind of stuff that black

958
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,000
box actually really prevents

959
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,399
you from getting getting benefit out of

960
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,399
and so the opposite is white box which

961
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:54,799
is

962
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,799
high levels of collaboration sharing a

963
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,840
lot of information

964
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,360
that's where the king is walking you

965
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,880
around pointing things out

966
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,159
introducing you to the guards

967
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,159
introducing you to the architect

968
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,000
of the overall system and that's really

969
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,519
the better way to do it

970
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,240
and it it replaces this mistaken notion

971
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,200
that you can replicate real world

972
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,000
results

973
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,760
by withholding information that's that's

974
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,039
really really bad what you want to do

975
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,080
instead

976
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,360
is you want to capitalize on one of the

977
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,880
few advantages that defenders have

978
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,320
defenders have

979
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,240
the advantage that's information

980
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,080
information leads to shortcuts

981
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,559
so being able to say to your to your

982
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,679
security team

983
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,799
this is what the whole thing looks like

984
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,760
what should we care about and they're

985
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,360
like that

986
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,240
that might take an outside organization

987
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,080
weeks or months or maybe never

988
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,240
to get to the like that that you got in

989
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,519
20 minutes

990
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,600
right and and i think in that analogy

991
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,519
you say also too that you know

992
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,679
the the king hired these knights to try

993
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:52,799
to get in and

994
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,880
they couldn't and then a week later they

995
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,559
got attacked you know they got attacked

996
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,080
by this underground tunnel that they

997
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
never told the nights about right so

998
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,360
so like had the knights known there was

999
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,799
an underground tunnel like that's

1000
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,000
something they could have

1001
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,039
you know uh used as as a way to to get

1002
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,480
in type thing so

1003
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,120
so yeah i think that you know uh you you

1004
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,799
you really make the case for being

1005
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,080
making sure that the you pick a security

1006
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,679
partner that's going to

1007
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,799
you know help um

1008
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,000
help you figure out you know yeah find

1009
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,120
out those things that are important to

1010
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,480
you the things that you know about the

1011
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,440
things that

1012
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,080
uh that way you can speed up the testing

1013
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,600
and really get more out of what you're

1014
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,200
paying for right

1015
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,320
totally um so then uh you know i just

1016
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,760
wanted to ask you a bit about like what

1017
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,360
are your thoughts about like how do you

1018
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,120
choose like

1019
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,679
uh vendors or third-party you know

1020
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:44,240
because you

1021
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,240
ever today everyone's got to work with

1022
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,919
other companies that have technology and

1023
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,120
they have your data and you guys are

1024
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,320
sharing data

1025
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,799
and you know i think i think target's

1026
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,720
probably one of the biggest examples of

1027
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,480
you know having a third-party vendor

1028
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,279
that

1029
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,039
where there was an exploit that that

1030
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,320
where they you know

1031
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,720
kind of got screwed over because of that

1032
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,840
how do you go about

1033
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,360
choosing vendors and working with

1034
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,519
third-party services

1035
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,799
or how should a company rather yeah so

1036
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,000
if you're if you're the

1037
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,919
the buyer of the services and you're

1038
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,200
looking to hire

1039
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,080
whether it's a service provider or

1040
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,039
you're looking to

1041
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,279
license or subscribe to a tool that's

1042
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,480
that is a difficult challenge and the

1043
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,440
reality is that when you start working

1044
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,360
with another company

1045
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,559
you are inherently accepting their

1046
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,640
security posture

1047
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,000
and so the way to think about that

1048
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,480
there's there's a few but

1049
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,000
the first thing that you want to do is

1050
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,519
you want to really understand what

1051
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,240
they're doing

1052
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,960
and so i mentioned earlier about how in

1053
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,080
chapter 10 and

1054
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,159
i explained to everyone like here's how

1055
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,519
to actually use it in your sales and

1056
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,480
marketing process

1057
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,000
so this is sitting on the other side of

1058
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,919
the table this is where you want to say

1059
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:56,399
okay

1060
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,799
what do i need to be getting from the

1061
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,399
people who are selling to me and what

1062
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,279
what should be the things that should uh

1063
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,519
raise some red flags for me

1064
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,239
the red flags would be anytime you hear

1065
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,520
people making

1066
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,879
uh claims that are hollow or they don't

1067
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:13,280
back

1068
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,359
up or just sound preposterous so things

1069
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,639
like some of the

1070
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,280
things that you hear all the time that

1071
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,040
are just total head scratchers

1072
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,560
people say things like well we use

1073
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,199
bank level security we have military

1074
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,719
grade encryption

1075
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,520
and those are ridiculous claims because

1076
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,719
what they're trying to do is they're

1077
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,159
trying to say because we use the same

1078
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,119
encryption

1079
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,119
as a bank or as a military what's

1080
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,399
required in the military because we use

1081
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,359
the same encryption

1082
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,639
we are as secure as a bank and that's

1083
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,719
just not true i mean that's like saying

1084
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,239
um this cheap

1085
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,000
hyundai entry-level hyundai is actually

1086
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,440
a luxury car because it has rolls-royce

1087
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,639
grade

1088
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,680
tire pressure it's like

1089
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,160
okay yeah i mean uh hyundai does have

1090
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,640
the same tire pressure as a rolls-royce

1091
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,800
but it's not a luxury car like what are

1092
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,079
you what are you trying to imply you're

1093
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,440
trying to apply this broader truth so

1094
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,560
that's one to be aware of

1095
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,160
another would be things like when people

1096
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,920
say oh we're highly secure

1097
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,640
and then they don't back it up or when

1098
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,240
they say oh we do

1099
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,040
uh annual external penetration testing

1100
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,480
and you're like why you do it only

1101
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,200
annually

1102
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,280
why is it only external and do you know

1103
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,119
what penetration testing actually means

1104
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,200
are you just getting a scan

1105
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,720
these are the kinds of things to look

1106
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,560
out for because many

1107
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,960
companies don't know how to do security

1108
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,079
and then they definitely know how to

1109
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,760
talk about it and so as the buyer that

1110
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,440
makes it really difficult

1111
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,400
in order to to understand those services

1112
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,160
how they thought about security what to

1113
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,200
do about it

1114
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
and it just requires a different level

1115
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,240
of effort

1116
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,680
in order to understand what you're

1117
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,599
getting into

1118
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,640
interesting um yeah i really i

1119
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,400
i've been really enjoying reading this

1120
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,760
book i haven't i haven't quite finished

1121
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,359
it yet but i i do like uh

1122
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,640
one of the things that i think that you

1123
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,160
did with is really cool is you kind of

1124
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,200
put some easter eggs

1125
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,680
or at least one easter egg in it and uh

1126
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,440
so you can you can go and and i'm not

1127
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,560
gonna i'm not gonna

1128
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,320
do any spoilers about the easter egg i

1129
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,160
want to encourage people to go out

1130
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,240
and buy the book and find it but then

1131
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,320
it's interactive too so you can you know

1132
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,400
you can go online and learn more about

1133
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,040
what you've

1134
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,680
learned from the book uh and kind of

1135
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,480
figure out these

1136
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,560
little hidden uh thing you know these

1137
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,920
hidden easter eggs that you got in the

1138
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,800
book

1139
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,119
and uh so i think it was really cool it

1140
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,960
was really fun and it was good for me

1141
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,359
you know someone that's not uh super

1142
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,440
technically savvy but you know somewhat

1143
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,079
aware

1144
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,320
um kind of putting things in in

1145
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,280
perspective so

1146
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,240
i highly recommend uh people go out buy

1147
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:42,800
the book

1148
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,560
you could buy it for you know your

1149
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,000
co-workers um

1150
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,320
you know people that you've maybe tried

1151
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,240
to explain security to and they roll

1152
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,160
their eyes at you or something like that

1153
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,680
like this is a fun book to read and it

1154
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,000
really

1155
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,520
helps uh put it in perspective and

1156
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,640
really helps the right it really

1157
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,720
um the regular person can wrap their

1158
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,480
mind around it so i really like what you

1159
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,200
did there

1160
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,040
and uh where can people get it if they

1161
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,520
want to buy the book

1162
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,440
well it's available on amazon so it'll

1163
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,640
be easy to find

1164
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,560
but maybe the simplest thing is to just

1165
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,480
go to hackablebook.com

1166
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,240
and anything you could need as a result

1167
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,680
of this conversation you'll find there

1168
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,119
so obviously there's a way to buy the

1169
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,400
book

1170
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,320
it describes the book my contact

1171
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,920
information is there so if you wanted to

show notes as well and i'll also

1183
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,839
uh find that the the crypto thing that

1184
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,440
we talked about the

1185
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,880

putting at the show notes as well so

1187
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,640
um yeah anything else any final

1188
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,920
final thoughts uh it's been a lot of fun

1189
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,320
yeah it's it's definitely been fun uh i

1190
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,560
think the only thing to end on is

1191
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,960
like i said for i'm an optimist and i

1192
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,079
think that

1193
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,839
so much of security is really focuses on

1194
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,760
fear and uncertainty and doubt and it's

1195
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,640
kind of like

1196
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,000
kind of a bummer and i think

1197
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,560
that security some of those things are

1198
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,200
true there's

1199
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,880
there's real problems out there

1200
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,800
uncertainty is re i mean

1201
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,000
no one knows anything about anything

1202
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,520
it's just like yes these are these are

1203
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,480
real challenges

1204
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,000
but there's really a bright

1205
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,440
light to all of this which is you know

1206
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,359
you look at a book like this and

1207
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,160
um and you look at books that my my

1208
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,839
peers and my friends and everyone in the

1209
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,200
security committee look at the security

1210
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,800
community even as a whole and the

1211
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,240
security conferences and like

1212
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,280
there's so many people working so hard

1213
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,119
to try to drive these the the industry

1214
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,280
forward to solve these problems and

1215
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,720
that would be one thing i'd want people

1216
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,480
to take away from this that

1217
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,920
yeah there's real problems but there's

1218
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,280
real solutions to those problems that's

1219
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,480
the one that's why i wrote this book

1220
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,000
that's how i wrote this book

1221
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,119
and uh you know don't don't

1222
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,760
succumb to the sort of fatigue that

1223
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,200
everyone has of security breach

1224
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,560
headlines and everything and

1225
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,040
it's not an impossible task and we're

1226
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,079
all in it together so

1227
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,200
that would that would be i think the

1228
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,560
last thing is sort of just end on a real

1229
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,599
positive note that

1230
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,880
yeah it's hard but most things worth

1231
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,359
doing

1232
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,599
are hard and so let's go build better

1233
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,920
more secure software systems

1234
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,960
