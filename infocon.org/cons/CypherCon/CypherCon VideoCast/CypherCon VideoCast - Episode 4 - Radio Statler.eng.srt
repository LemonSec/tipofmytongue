35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,760
when we were doing the radio statler

36
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,320
podcast i used to spam the public link

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,920
out just on twitter and be like hey

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,360
join us on our podcast and we would get

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,479
the internet on the podcast

40
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,040
man i love it i love it so maybe we

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,520
could just

42
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,119
uh start out just kind of talk a little

43
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,439
bit about what radio stattler is for

44
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,520
for those that aren't familiar and i

45
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,040
could just hear a little bit from each

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,479
of you give a little introduction how

47
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,439
you got

48
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,040
uh roped into the program uh

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,840
or uh how you know how you started in

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,520
the project and kind of what your role

51
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,159
is

52
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,759
uh so we can get to know you a little

53
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,439
bit better um

54
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,520
so maybe if we could start with uh

55
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,439
beaches then we can go bunny and then we

56
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,200
can go to johnny christmas

57
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,719
so uh beaches why don't you start us off

58
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,079
uh well so uh in terms of like what is

59
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,920
radio statler uh for those that are

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,280
unfamiliar uh

61
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,399
for the duration of the hoca uh which

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,239
generally takes place every other year

63
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,720
in new york city at hotel pennsylvania

64
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,840
uh wednesday

65
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,760
when does it usually take place it's

66
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,080
usually late july i think

67
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,959
usually the third week of july of even

68
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:21,760
years

69
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,040
but that changed this year

70
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,120
yeah yeah well did it though i think

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,560
it's still the third week no

72
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,480
it's still well no it's the last week

73
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,480
now and now we're going to have a

74
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,120
conference

75
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,879
on an audier next year yeah

76
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,519
but i mean that's not necessarily all

77
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,200
that unusual if you go like look at the

78
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,360
list of conferences on wikipedia

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
uh i think there's been three years

80
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
between before i don't think they've

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,640
ever done one back to back like this

82
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,440
so that's that's a little different but

83
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,519
yeah i think the first one was 1996 and

84
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,599
then there wasn't another one until

85
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,120
uh no it was 94 000. there's a 94

86
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,319
there was like 94 yeah

87
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,920
yeah it's definitely one of the older

88
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,400
conferences for sure um

89
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,680
second oldest in the us perhaps

90
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,760
i think heck or summer camp might be the

91
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,080
oldest do you think so i felt i feel

92
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,480
like

93
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,519
uh them and defcon started a pretty

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,720
similar

95
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,400
in terms of timing right i thought

96
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,159
hacker summer camp had started in the

97
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:22,480
late

98
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,920
80s you would know better than i would i

99
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,400
think

100
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,640
yeah but definitely like there was there

101
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,599
was a time

102
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,200
for a long period well

103
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,319
a period where hope and defcon were the

104
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,239
only conferences now there were

105
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,400
certainly small conferences starting to

106
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,120
spring up

107
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,000
um inspired by defcon and hope already

108
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,080
even in the early 2000s but

109
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,720
until like 20 pretty much until the

110
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,280
target and home depot breaches

111
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,760
um when information security became a

112
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,959
career

113
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,000
uh there wasn't much of a conference

114
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,439
circuit to speak of it was

115
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,040
uh hope and defcon and because they were

116
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,640
the only two there was a kind of an

117
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,879
unspoken rivalry and we had there was a

118
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,400
an unwritten rule at hope where you

119
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,080
don't you don't mention defcon you don't

120
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,840
say defcon like you use the word defcon

121
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,040
somebody's gonna

122
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,759
put a hand on your shoulder and go hey

123
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,890
let's keep it down on the defcon huh

124
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,680
[Laughter]

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,919
now that that's not the case anymore but

126
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,600
um and all the other conferences out

127
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,560
there for the most part

128
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,440
really just excuses to come get your

129
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,520
2600 groups together

130
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,639
once a year you know they would have

131
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,160
30 attendees 50 attendees

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,919
and then of course that'll change during

133
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,120
2011 2012 2013.

134
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,720
so it's been around for a while that's

135
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,040
that's uh yeah it's early 90s yeah

136
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,120
so then when did radio statler start

137
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,080
recording the con

138
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,199
and how did that come about um 2008.

139
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,240
yeah that was 2008 um our friend

140
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,000
nick god uh came up for some reason he

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,160
would have been i think

142
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,440
uh pretty young honestly uh but he came

143
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,800
up with a bunch of recording stuff and i

144
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,759
think they just kind of

145
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,960
set up shop on

146
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,880
i can run with that one so right before

147
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,400
the 2008 hope

148
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,160
uh the hope forums hadn't shown up on

149
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
the internet and emanuel

150
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,919
was pretty much reaching out for anybody

151
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,360
who wants to do projects that was the

152
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,280
year the amd project you know got

153
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,880
started that was that that the

154
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,160
cool rfid thing um and then uh one of

155
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,479
our friends lexicon suggested a way

156
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,080
to bring hope to people who can't be at

157
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,600
hope and so

158
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,919
a group of us on the hope forums got

159
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,039
together and we're like well let's make

160
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:39,840
this happen

161
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,759
and that's what we did and that that was

162
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,120
a big deal because um

163
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,240
hope being a

164
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,600
a sister con to uh the chaos computer

165
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,039
congress attracted

166
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,880
a lot of international especially

167
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,240
european

168
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,039
attendees and also people who wished

169
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,000
they could attend

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,880
but uh you know transatlantic flight is

171
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,600
not

172
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,440
reasonable for many people uh and so

173
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,759
having a way of bringing hope to those

174
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,759
people who heard like who only knew of

175
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,240
the chaos computer congress in

176
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,000
is that always in germany i believe it's

177
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,600
always in germany i think you're right

178
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,800
yeah um and they found wow there's

179
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,560
there's there's something else america

180
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,840
has won

181
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,560
and uh being able to provide that to

182
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,520
them is really cool

183
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,280
we definitely get a large amount of

184
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,720
european listeners on the

185
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,600
radio station yeah that's definitely

186
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,400
true we have a

187
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,440
pretty decent european listenership

188
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,000
um but we are happy to say that uh we

189
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,800
also have

190
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,240
on every continent we've had at least

191
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,919
one person tune in uh

192
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,800
i think in the past i said almost i said

193
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,280
almost

194
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,680
i do i don't think you did i'm pretty

195
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,319
sure

196
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,240
we've been hardcore shooting for

197
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,919
antarctica and coming so

198
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,960
close yeah uh but it's it's you know

199
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
hard to line up

200
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,479
yeah because like the the people that

201
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,560
live down there like uh i think they

202
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,000
rotate like they're not there all the

203
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,039
time right uh

204
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,000
and then uh that's the middle of their

205
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,520
winter

206
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,680
so it's not like it's got a lot of

207
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,440
people down there so you're gonna like

208
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,280
you're trying to find that one guy

209
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,960
that's just like keeping the servers on

210
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,160
yeah

211
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,639
man the it guy who doesn't yeah and find

212
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,759
that lightning like i'm sure you need

213
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,720
something to listen to but you gotta

214
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,000
find him yeah yeah

215
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,840
it's like how do you like you can't just

216
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,840
like email sysadmin at like

217
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
antarctica.org

218
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,599
so yeah go ahead

219
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,880
so um definitely there's been some

220
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,479
postings on twitter uh

221
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,120
i know a guy that knows a guy who's like

222
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,160
brother

223
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,759
used to like uh i think it's like what

224
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,080
worked at one of the stations down there

225
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,919
so the earlier this year actually like

226
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:56,800
oh hey you know

227
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,319
you know this guy can you like email him

228
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,599
and see if his brother's still down

229
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,560
there and

230
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,240
um like really uh i think that probably

231
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,039
there is some way to like make requests

232
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,879
for like

233
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,080
like you would think that if you're

234
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,440
stationed in america there's probably

235
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,520
some like public outreach program

236
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,680
i just haven't found out what that is i

237
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,639
tried to apply

238
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,720
there was like i remember seeing you

239
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,479
could like win to be part of an

240
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,000
expedition down there or something like

241
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,039
that and

242
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,639
i either applied or thought about

243
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,919
applying i think i thought about

244
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,280
applying and looked at the application

245
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,240
i'm like

246
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,000
that does happen on occasion um

247
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,440
metallica

248
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,200
at least had attempted to play a show

249
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,399
down there not sure if it actually

250
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,360
happened

251
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,958
uh for similar reasons they wanted to be

252
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,080
able to say they've played on every

253
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,958
column

254
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,640
said let's put together and all i can

255
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,080
think of is like wow it's a great idea

256
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,440
just put thousands of people down on

257
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,240
antarctica

258
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,000
and just have them make their beer cups

259
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
their

260
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,880
trash come on it's not like people don't

261
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,560
clean up that

262
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,600
so the uh there's there are people down

263
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,040
there we just had the

264
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,360
antarctica's first tinder match down

265
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,040
there is that right

266
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
yeah so that was that's a thing there's

267
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,040
people down there and they get lonely

268
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,279
and uh you can fix that with tinder or

269
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,480
with a radio stand

270
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,640
there but doesn't it everyone just like

271
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,560
live in the same place

272
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,040
research facility no i just assume

273
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,680
everybody

274
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,720
ever lives in the same spot

275
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,959
yeah they get to the northernmost point

276
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,800
of antarctica they're like this is good

277
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,240
this is that's just it's done we're here

278
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,279
we're done we anything going on

279
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,959
further than this probably isn't

280
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,800
important just ignore it

281
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,560
so how long does it take to travel

282
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,320
across antarctica like for these

283
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,000
these tinder matches like do they get to

284
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,760
go the largest

285
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,360
oh yeah so they were you got to be

286
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,959
i don't know what's the max distance you

287
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,120
could set on tinder isn't there a max

288
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,040
it's got to be that i've literally

289
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,880
i've only built robots which use tinder

290
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,030
i don't actually know the settings

291
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,240
[Laughter]

292
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,399
just to [ __ ] with people or was it did

293
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,440
you have uh

294
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,880
some other kind of purpose that you're

295
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,720
using the robots for

296
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,000
oh just for memes

297
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,959
as the kids say just for the walls yeah

298
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:15,360
yeah

299
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,120
and you build a robot that just swipes

300
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,160
at everybody and then you make your

301
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,839
profile picture a robot and go i am a

302
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,600
robot don't reply to me and then the

303
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,000
event

304
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
invariably you get messages and then you

305
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,839
just respond like a robot would

306
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,680
oh that's great that's great

307
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,120
i had a friend who had a um chicken

308
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,880
tender on tinder so it's a chicken

309
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,399
tender tinder

310
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,480
and she would a profile picture is like

311
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,600
hey i'm a chicken tender

312
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,320
for burger king i have a crispy outside

313
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,720
juicy interior like here's my caloric

314
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,680
content

315
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,200
and then she would get messages all the

316
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,720
time and would respond as if you were

317
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,240
talking to a chicken tender

318
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,160
oh my god i didn't know so then she put

319
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,560
screenshots of all of these messages on

320
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,680
on a tumblr

321
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,959
and she called it the chicken tender

322
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,760
tinder tumbler

323
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,040
and it was a great time yeah you can

324
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,680
like it's i mean and that's hacking

325
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,320
that's

326
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,560
that's taking something especially

327
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,320
something technological

328
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,640
and making it do something that it's not

329
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,399
supposed to do or using in a way that

330
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,320
the original manufacturer didn't intend

331
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,079
like that's hacking to the most like

332
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,000
purest degree so that's

333
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,600
here's the thing you can use you go okay

334
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,240
let's see how can we use this well i'm

335
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,880
gonna

336
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,200
put a chicken tender on it but then

337
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,320
still converse with people

338
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,240
i love it so you're in every continent

339
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,680
except for antarctica

340
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,079
and so are they able to you know

341
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,279
communicate with you do you have them on

342
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,560
the show do you have them call in or

343
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,560
anything like that

344
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,839
yeah we still use the irks yeah uh

345
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,959
so previously um

346
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,320
what we've done has been irc mostly uh

347
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,399
we generally like every time we try to

348
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,240
set up i don't know why

349
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,399
uh we've come this far and like every

350
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,920
time we try to set up like some people

351
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,040
to call in it's either

352
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,600
a giant mess um and just doesn't work

353
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,959
i miss the call in days so much we had a

354
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,800
phone we had a phone in the studio

355
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,560
that is true where you could call in and

356
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,920
out and i loved

357
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,279
taking callers for all of the reasons

358
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,639
you can imagine um but yeah we

359
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,399
it pretty much we've i think given up on

360
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,760
it at this point every time we try to

361
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,279
set it up it just doesn't

362
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,920
yeah it doesn't really work okay gotcha

363
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,440
and it's not a bandwidth issue i mean

364
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
hope famously has

365
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,040
hope has the baddest hope is it

366
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,760
yeah hope is that such a fat pipe that

367
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,880
there's a challenge

368
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,160
from the isp every year to max it out

369
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,519
but they dare us and we never come

370
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,959
close we hit like 10 the isp is like hey

371
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,639
we dare uh a building with 3 000 hackers

372
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,720
in it

373
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,720
2500 to max out this internet pipe

374
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,680
please please try and so everyone will

375
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,760
write every script possible to download

376
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,959
the biggest things you can

377
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,000
imagine and it's like yeah we we spiked

378
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,959
at 18

379
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,320
uh saturday night yeah

380
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,800
the best part is is that um because of

381
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,920
the way that they have to get that

382
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,279
amount of ips because they don't do

383
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,120
netting um

384
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,560
oh yeah everyone gets the public

385
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
everybody gets a public ip address

386
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,519
network yeah um

387
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,519
they have it set up so that uh when you

388
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,120
sign in like you can use a username and

389
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,800
a password but it accepts literally any

390
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
username or password

391
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,160
but that way everybody gets their own

392
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,639
key and it's uh you know

393
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,399
you're secure um but

394
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,720
yeah everybody gets a public id uh and

395
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,760
then because

396
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,480
uh they'll pretty much do a list of the

397
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:46,959
at the

398
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,839
closing ceremony with like uh whoever

399
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,639
downloaded spider-man 2

400
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,199
would you just delete that please yeah

401
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:55,920
because they didn't

402
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,839
exactly like take down notices

403
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,040
or something magic mike was the the one

404
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,839
that was

405
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,199
that was the infamous one we got the

406
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,959
complaint on

407
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,800
oh i definitely remember spider-man 2

408
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,079
but i think that that was

409
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,800
uh that would have been several years

410
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,639
ago it was it magic mike was probably

411
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,079
last year but we get like a couple of

412
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,839
take down notices at least yeah

413
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,680
so the closing ceremonies they do here's

414
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,880
all the statistics for

415
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,399
the internet utilization and just the

416
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,839
network in general like the knock will

417
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,440
do a presentation and it's very well

418
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,959
received and part of it is like and

419
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,000
here's uh

420
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,920
here's the gmca takedown notices we're

421
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,959
required to forward to you

422
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,959
that's that's fantastic you downloaded

423
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,399
magic mike

424
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,519
uh you shouldn't have

425
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,800
that's all we got like there isn't any

426
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,920
recourse right it's like oh what are we

427
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,560
gonna do

428
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,480
we're gonna right off of the network

429
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,240
that we have already dismantled

430
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,279
and so that's that comes from um

431
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,480
the chaos computer camp does that uh and

432
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,320
i believe congress as well where they do

433
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,519
the same thing where everyone gets a

434
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,880
public ip

435
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,000
and it's because well not

436
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,040
openly because but it it very greatly

437
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,800
enables the ability to

438
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,279
transfer information and things which

439
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,240
may be

440
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,279
legally dubious and by the time

441
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,360
the legal by the time the authorities

442
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,120
get around to saying hey we've got to

443
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,040
confiscate these servers

444
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,959
it's two months later and the camp is

445
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,800
dismantled or the con is dismantled the

446
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,560
long gone are like

447
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,680
good luck buddy and there's the

448
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,079
there's the abandoned train station

449
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,519
where the camp used to be you're welcome

450
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,360
to see if someone accidentally left the

451
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,920
server back there but

452
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,120
you're a little late to the party that's

453
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,880
awesome

454
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,839
uh so so where do you guys get most your

455
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,360
listeners from that are they mostly

456
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,880
outside the united states or are they

457
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,759
mostly other services you can pay

458
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,839
and you can forgetting listeners

459
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
i'm gonna be honest like we don't every

460
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,720
time we do radio statler like we pretty

461
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,079
much we lose money right because we're

462
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,199
not we have to pay for tickets we have

463
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,040
to pay for hotel we have to pay to like

464
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
drive up with oh yeah we don't get a

465
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,199
budget yeah we don't

466
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,279
have only recently started acknowledging

467
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,199
that we're sucking up space inside their

468
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,519
conference

469
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,959
and that's i mean that's a good story to

470
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,880
tell like we've gone from

471
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,399
it's it's a cool story about

472
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,399
like it really shows you how hope is and

473
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,839
what the mentality is there and that

474
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,560
like

475
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,800
there's there up until recently there

476
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,720
was the entire empty mezzanine level of

477
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,759
a hotel

478
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,079
where uh outside of the vendor space

479
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,040
that was rented out

480
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,680
you could just grab a table and go this

481
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,720
one's mine

482
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,800
and i'm gonna do this here and then

483
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,639
everyone goes okay

484
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,160
and so these guys said uh this is mine

485
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,639
we're gonna host a radio station here

486
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,199
and then everyone went okay

487
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,720
let us let us know if you're dead and

488
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,120
that's how it goes and so it started as

489
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,639
a very personal

490
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,959
like thing where a group of hackers just

491
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,399
said this is what we're gonna do

492
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,720
and it was not it's not hope sanctioned

493
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,319
you didn't have to register

494
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,439
your village with the conference and

495
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,000
uh have a cfp for your booth and all

496
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,280
this [ __ ]

497
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,679
uh it was just like hey radio statler is

498
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,520
here and it's a radio station and people

499
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:17,919
would then

500
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,359
walk by and go what is this so we go oh

501
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,599
it's a radio station and they go

502
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,760
whoa how does that work and we go ah

503
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,919
i don't really know surprisingly

504
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,880
yeah yeah like magic and i'm not

505
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,080
exaggerating

506
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,200
so it's it's super super grass roots

507
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,640
i've never been to hope yeah is that

508
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,240
like is that what everyone does or is

509
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,160
that just you guys

510
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,280
um there's regulars now where mitch you

511
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,039
know runs the soldering village

512
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,760
and uh there's the chaos who who runs

513
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,120
the old computer

514
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,160
uh uh it used to be march

515
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,960
but i think that they i don't remember

516
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,799
what the new name is they you recently

517
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,039
reorganized as of last time

518
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,480
so there's an organization that brings

519
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,039
really old computers that all still work

520
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,640
and they just show up and they go all

521
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,160
right let's find a place to set these

522
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,679
all up and they just do that and it's

523
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:10,720
just there

524
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,400
i mean it's cool they network them all

525
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,000
together as much as they can which

526
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,679
is really cool because most of them

527
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,200
weren't ever supposed to talk to each

528
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,160
other

529
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,559
um it's it's neat stuff and you can play

530
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,760
games on them and crap

531
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,520
and yeah that's how it is it's very much

532
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,840
it's it's a place

533
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,559
where very little work is done and it's

534
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,320
just like where's the biggest openest

535
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,840
room where we can put a bunch of hackers

536
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,919
to do whatever they want

537
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,679
and then also by not sanctioning any of

538
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,200
it you kind of absolve yourself from a

539
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,080
lot of the liability

540
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,919
but it's a testament to radio statler

541
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,000
that in recent years we've actually

542
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,160
become more directly involved as an

543
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,320
official part of hope

544
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,400
and hope acknowledges us and asks if

545
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,440
we're coming and

546
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,480
we can ask hope for amenities and

547
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,160
official space and things and so

548
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,960
like we've gone from you know a bunch of

549
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,480
people doing a weird thing literally in

550
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,840
the corner

551
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,760
to a thing hope as a conference

552
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,160
hopes that we keep doing yeah and so

553
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,919
that's pretty cool

554
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,160
the the voice of hope as it says on your

555
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,039
shirt bunny

556
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,559
for those that are listening oh it's got

557
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,480
the whole radio statler

558
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,880
logo let's keep the jiggling down

559
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,320
this is a family show is it really a

560
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
family show i was told that we could say

561
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,679
[ __ ] on this yeah this is

562
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,400
this is hey this is a happy show

563
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,400
anti-censorship

564
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:45,520
[Laughter]

565
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,640
um cool so

566
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,640
uh so so how did each of you get

567
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,960
involved in in radio statler like when

568
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,480
was it like how did you get

569
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,640
involved like what's what's your role um

570
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,840
uh so for me at least i got involved in

571
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,480
2012 uh

572
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,320
and essentially what happened is uh

573
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,960
i'd known nick god for a very long time

574
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,400
um

575
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,600
and he was like hey uh i'm gonna pay

576
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,919
for are you interested in coming to hope

577
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,280
and they're like yeah

578
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,080
it was like okay uh i'm gonna pay for

579
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,559
your

580
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,559
hotel and your ticket and you're just

581
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,400
gonna have to get your ass to new york

582
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,840
uh at these dates uh and then i

583
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,640
did um and then i spent three days

584
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,919
uh cutting audio into uh

585
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,440
shows and putting it on the internet

586
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,880
and then they were like you should come

587
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,760
back and i was like yeah okay i guess so

588
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,360
and then uh i've been i guess kind of

589
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,240
the pre

590
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,080
production director i think is is the

591
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,280
term we're using so

592
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,400
so for me uh i'm i'm in charge sucker is

593
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,200
the term i've

594
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,720
heard how is that

595
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,039
so obviously it's a thankless job

596
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,840
i certainly haven't thanked him i can

597
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,760
confirm

598
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,720
i thank him because he took over my job

599
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,080
yeah that's true

600
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,080
yeah bunny used to do it that's true um

601
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,799
but yeah so so uh we use bunny used to

602
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,520
and uh

603
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,080
i've since taken over like getting

604
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,280
scheduling content

605
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,760
and uh getting people like interesting

606
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,880
people to come on

607
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,799
uh which sometimes is just like sending

608
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,960
somebody a twitter dm or sending them an

609
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,919
email

610
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,280
uh or randomly going to the hallway be

611
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,000
like you look

612
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,520
weird and interesting you should come

613
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,559
talk on the radio and then they go okay

614
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,639
and then they just follow you uh

615
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,679
um so yeah i don't know if that's uh

616
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:56,400
that's pretty much

617
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,679
been my involvement um i'm still

618
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,520
involved with doing some of the archival

619
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,360
work uh

620
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,400
but that's mostly been taken over

621
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,159
by somebody else at this point uh which

622
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,679
is good

623
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,880
um oh yeah we have the archives

624
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,080
we have archives years ago we do i think

625
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,480
we have weird stuff

626
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,400
it's uh we're getting way off the topic

627
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,000
of how to get started here

628
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,679
go ahead and talk about the weird stuff

629
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,360
though i mean you say weird like so part

630
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,640
of the onesies

631
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,039
so we we don't know how to stay on topic

632
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,799
no that's not what we do here

633
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,320
um i think bacon and cheese hours

634
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,440
probably the best most popular

635
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,520
segments the bacon and cheese hour it

636
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,559
was i think

637
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,559
in 2008 no bacon and cheese was second

638
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,200
year was it oh it was 20 200 200

639
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,559
so um nicod

640
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,400
literally hands a stranger it's like hey

641
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,320
we're doing it we need to cook bacon

642
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,360
uh take my credit card go to kmart

643
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,039
buy um a pan an induction burner

644
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,159
and uh bacon in peas and

645
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,240
insects here technically actually

646
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,000
technically this was the cheese

647
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,520
hour oh i i brought up because i love

648
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,559
cheese i brought up

649
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,880
let's let's find ways and eat cheese and

650
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,320
talk about it and we were like well we

651
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,120
have to have

652
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
bacon to go with cheese so then it

653
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,400
mutated into

654
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
the bacon not a phrase i've ever

655
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,720
personally heard

656
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,720
and so and so hope you need bacon with

657
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,880
your cheese we wanted to wrap

658
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,720
cheese and bacon and cook it and that's

659
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,159
where the bacon came in and i mean

660
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,080
that's delicious

661
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,720
and hope is in central manhattan

662
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,080
generally

663
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
uh and so like if you it's not just a

664
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,919
matter of like oh we'll run to the kmart

665
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:46,960
up the road like

666
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,080
you have to navigate you know midtown

667
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,279
manhattan to get to a kmart to

668
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,520
and now you've handed a stranger at the

669
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
hacker con your credit card

670
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,799
said go buy me bacon and the things

671
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,840
to cook bacon in an empty hotel room or

672
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,919
an empty hotel floor

673
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,799
uh and and it worked so well that we've

674
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,240
done it multiple times

675
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,080
i do remember that was also the time

676
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,440
that we've gotten everything except for

677
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,799
like a spatula

678
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,640
like we didn't have anything to actually

679
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,799
pull off so we handed off we grabbed uh

680
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,039
the the lady in charge of the volunteers

681
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,960
were like hey we need you to go buy us a

682
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,840
spatula

683
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,799
i don't care where and so that's that's

684
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,000
a great example

685
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,279
of radio statler so what we like

686
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,640
it's easy enough for us to just

687
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,600
re-broadcast the talks that are going on

688
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,320
um which we do and is greatly

689
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,640
appreciated by a lot of the listeners

690
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,720
um we we do video and audio

691
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,679
video can be hard for a lot of people

692
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,520
who want to consume the content to get

693
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
where they're at um in a lot of the

694
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,600
talks especially at hope

695
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,279
hope is more of a hacktivist

696
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,279
anarcho anarcho-political conference

697
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,880
with hacker leanings uh and so the talks

698
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,000
often

699
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,440
work fairly well audio only uh for for

700
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,039
most people so that's cool

701
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,360
um especially in the years where you

702
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,360
have like jello biafra doing two hour

703
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,039
political rants um things like that just

704
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,760
great times and so but because hope is

705
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,240
also

706
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,120
very much a 24-hour conference which is

707
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,720
one of my favorite things about it

708
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,880
you can have a blast at 4am inside the

709
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,919
conference

710
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,240
my best times pretty much happened after

711
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,960
10 p.m

712
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,120
yeah hotel pennsylvania where it was

713
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,159
held uh

714
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,200
has like i mentioned before an empty

715
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,520
mezzanine floor the entire floor of the

716
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,960
hotel there used to be uh

717
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,760
like a it used to be shops like a mini

718
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,320
little indoor shopping mall in the hotel

719
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,200
they tore it all out decades ago and

720
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,679
never

721
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,760
put anything back in it so it's

722
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,640
literally the entire floor of a hotel

723
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,279
empty and that and they let hope use it

724
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,159
and hope is the

725
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,360
only entity that uses it uh

726
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,919
and but because hope's using it for the

727
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,039
duration

728
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,039
it's just open 24 hours you could just

729
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,120
go up there and somebody's doing

730
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,000
something

731
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,039
uh and so the talks end around

732
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,320
uh what 9 p.m usually the last stocks go

733
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,760
on about 9 or 10.

734
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,320
yeah and so then after that you've got

735
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,480
another 12 hours of

736
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,000
of of dead air to fill

737
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,559
and radio statler fills that um and we

738
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,200
have on

739
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,120
not only do we have on this like a lot

740
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,320
of the speakers who

741
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,400
already presented and let them either

742
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,840
talk more about their topic or talk

743
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,880
about something else completely

744
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,799
unrelated but we have on

745
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,080
um entities which happen to be attending

746
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,600
the conference which aren't presenting

747
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,679
we have the the pirate party

748
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,760
yeah almost every every year the pirate

749
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,200
party comes on and does a whole pirate

750
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,320
party hour

751
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,200
uh and they're a blast uh just things

752
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,080
like that we try to invent content

753
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,440
and the the la the wee hours definitely

754
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,480
turned into

755
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,279
uh creepy conspiracy theorists rants and

756
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,559
uh

757
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,440
inside joke runs and just drunkenness

758
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,240
and

759
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,840
board games and it's a really good time

760
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,399
when did bacon really happen like what

761
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,080
time was bacon and cheese

762
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,880
uh we did that like in the middle of the

763
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,000
evening i think

764
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,880
2 a.m no i think we actually did the

765
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,520
actual

766
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,120
hour in the middle but we had so much

767
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,360
bacon left over that we cooked bacon for

768
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,320
the rest of the weekend

769
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,480
oh yeah and man that's it's a great

770
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,080
prank if you want to play a prank on a

771
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,000
group of people at 2 a.m just cook a

772
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,840
small amount of bacon somewhere so they

773
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,919
can smell it

774
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,840
it's the worst thing you can do yeah

775
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,760
there was a sign that ended up

776
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,840
at the the top of the escalator coming

777
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,039
up to the mezzanine there was a sign

778
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:49,440
that said

779
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,960
like yes you do smell bacon

780
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,039
so why was the bacon so popular

781
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,000
it's bacon yeah bacon on the radio

782
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,360
though because you can't smell it on the

783
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,240
radio

784
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,600
you can hear it it was just our

785
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,919
us being us i guess yeah it was the

786
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:08,960
personalities

787
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,840
cooking and consuming the bacon yeah it

788
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,360
was just a weird show

789
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,159
content around the bacon i can see that

790
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:16,880
yeah

791
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,240
i mean it also it was like what 2008

792
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,960
2010 uh i don't think it happened in

793
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,679
2012

794
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,360
like in that time period though that was

795
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,039
like when the internet went like just

796
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,080
[ __ ] bonkers for bacon like that was

797
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,799
about that

798
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,640
oh yeah oh you want a bacon ball like

799
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,159
bacon mayonnaise right

800
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,960
salt bacon lollipops bacon yeah covered

801
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,080
in chocolate

802
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,320
if you think we do remember a time

803
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,480
before bacon was popular yeah

804
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,640
everybody always liked bacon but we

805
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,880
never eventually like the internet one

806
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,279
of the

807
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,120
biggest accomplishments of the internet

808
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,799
was allowing everyone to realize that

809
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,000
bacon is universally loved

810
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,360
and it's true something the entire

811
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,760
internet agrees on it's like oh well yes

812
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,200
bacon

813
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,919
there was so wow i never knew that there

814
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,360

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,479
like there's a free bacon

816

as recently as earlier or late last year

876
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,720
uh because they keep just going in

and violating terms of service

878
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,120
left and right in the interest of

879
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,919
neopets like they're big fans

880
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,559
to the extent where they do shady stuff

881
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,200

884
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,039

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,839
they don't have enough of those stickers

1009
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,078
uh

1010
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,839
there's like 14 that is not enough

1011
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,440
shitty they're all shitty meetings i

1012
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,560
don't think i've ever

1013
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,119
had a notch you literally need a sticker

1014
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,640
for every single day of this year

1015
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,839
so far i need 365 another shitty meeting

1016
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,160
oh all right so when does hope start uh

1017
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,720
july

1018
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,760
25th 25th coming up here

1019
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,000
it'll go through august 2nd is the last

1020
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,800
day

1021
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,079
and how are you guys doing talks and

1022
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,000
how's all that going can i happen

1023
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,440
so talk wise they haven't

1024
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,520
really they haven't announced the

1025
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
platform yet that they're going to use

1026
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,200
well so it's exactly that's not true uh

1027
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,560
so uh usually uh talks

1028
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,040
are like conferences split into multiple

1029
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,079
tracks

1030
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,599
and what they did this year is they kept

1031
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,960
the same number of talks but that put

1032
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,480
them into a single track which is why

1033
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,000
the conference is three times as long

1034
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,599
except yeah it's nine

1035
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,520
um so you could hit all the talks if you

1036
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,280
wanted to if you wanted to

1037
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,599
you could just yeah you could shock that

1038
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,320
you could sit for nine days and just

1039
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,160
uh yeah another one um

1040
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,280
so uh it's a single track um

1041
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,119
what they've done previously for video

1042
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,560
streaming for talks which they've

1043
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,000
done in the past is they uh have

1044
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,119
i think partner with like i think it's

1045
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,560
the internet society if i recall

1046
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,520
correctly

1047
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,359
um so they'll they'll just be a live

1048
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,640
stream and they'll just do

1049
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,720
they'll have people come in and they'll

1050
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,960
do either a pre-recorded talk or

1051
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,320
a live talk um and then if you buy a

1052
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,440
ticket there's um

1053
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,839
some additional interactivity aside from

1054
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,040
like if you just want to watch the talk

1055
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,200
you don't have to pay for a ticket but

1056
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,920
if you want to talk to um you're going

1057
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,480
to do like

1058
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,359
adventures there's like q a sessions um

1059
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,720
if you want to do any workshops they are

1060
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,880
doing workshops um i'm interested to see

1061
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,079
how that goes

1062
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,000
uh because the workshops are obviously

1063
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,440
all gonna be virtual

1064
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,880
um so actually uh for this year they

1065
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,480
asked us they reached out to us and

1066
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,839
were like hey are you still doing radio

1067
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,119
statler and

1068
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,599
could you please submit as a workshop so

1069
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,560
uh the workshop

1070
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,599
it should be an interesting kind of

1071
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,839
format um those can be partially

1072
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,359
pre-recorded but there's some stuff that

1073
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,079
you

1074
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,839
would still need to like for q a or

1075
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,119
anything like that um

1076
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,880
so that'll be kind of interesting i

1077
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,240
don't think i've seen

1078
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,079
uh any other virtual conferences that

1079
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,520
have done work like a workshop

1080
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,200
format yeah that'll that is interesting

1081
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,400
um so but i mean it's very ambitious

1082
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,160
uh as far as i can tell and that's kind

1083
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,000
of what hope does is just

1084
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,599
be very ambitious uh so either it's

1085
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,880
going to be good or it's going to be

1086
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,240
really really good

1087
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,680
and we'll kind of see where it shakes

1088
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,160
out uh in terms of radio statler

1089
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,480
uh we haven't decided necessarily but

1090
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,160
we've decided

1091
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,680
we don't necessarily know what platform

1092
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,760
we're going to stream to or anything

1093
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,720
like that

1094
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,520
uh but we're we're planning to do video

1095
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,880
as well as audio this year

1096
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,480
uh there'll still be an audio stream is

1097
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,079
the plan

1098
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,520
um and then uh so yeah we're gonna try

1099
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,079
to fill up

1100
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,359
24 hours of uh

1134
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,319
i had a thought oh yeah so yeah i wanted

1135
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,079
to ask you guys about just cons in

1136
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:06,960
general like

1137
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,160
uh in 2020. i mean most of the cons

1138
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,800
either

1139
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,599
moved to virtual or they just canceled

1140
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,560
all the other

1141
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,040
um

1142
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,960
what are you guys thoughts around like

1143
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,560
where where khan's right now and what do

1144
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,359
you see like

1145
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,760
going forward um you guys have any

1146
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,800
thoughts about that and i

1147
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,079
i um i had uh trenton and sean on the

1148
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,760
podcast talking about

1149
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,119
uh infosec oasis they moved to alt space

1150
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:35,599
vr

1151
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,520
platform to do a con and it sounded

1152
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,440
really cool and i actually got into

1153
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,680
uh all space i just got innocuous too

1154
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,640
just because i was like

1155
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,119
this sounds cool like you know uh and

1156
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,040
their thought was that you know

1157
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,800
um that

1158
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,880
kovid could be the catalyst that starts

1159
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,000
the oasis the

1160
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,680
you know the ready player one oasis

1161
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,359
which may or may not happen we'll we'll

1162
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,240
see but

1163
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,640
um i don't think we're we're and and

1164
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,240
johnny looks very skeptical

1165
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,520
but uh i have opinions when you're

1166
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,960
ready for him you can tell

1167
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,119
that's opinions with a capital o and a

1168
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,599
trademark

1169
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,240
at the end yeah i turned my ears on for

1170
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:16,880
that

1171
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,760
so um yeah so anyways any thoughts that

1172
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,480
you guys have

1173
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,760
on uh on cons and uh

1174
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,640
and let's hear your opinions on vr i

1175
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,040
know

1176
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,599
i mean i still think that because it's

1177
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:30,240
july

1178
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,560
and covet is still a pretty much a thing

1179
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,079
i think a lot of cons like i only had

1180
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,599
two planned this year and

1181
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,160
one just up and canceled very recently i

1182
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,440
think most of them are just trying to

1183
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,400
hope they can pull

1184
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,160
the later part of the year and then just

1185
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,560
canceling but uh

1186
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,040
a lot of cons are now sitting and

1187
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,800
realizing that they're not gonna happen

1188
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,920
so now we're gonna come up with really

1189
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,079
great ideas as to how to do new cons

1190
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,599
and then i'm i'm guessing by the end of

1191
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,640
the year we're gonna see some really

1192
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,359
interesting things

1193
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,680
yeah yeah i agree and it all it all

1194
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,440
depends like where this thing goes too

1195
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,240
you know like

1196
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,480
i don't know it might be it might be a

1197
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,240
while before we have any kind of regular

1198
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:06,720
kind of

1199
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,960
uh gathering suit but we i mean we don't

1200
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,319
know we don't have our crystal balls

1201
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,280
yeah i don't

1202
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,560
i don't think that we're going to have

1203
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,400
any major cons until af

1204
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,040
you know until the start of 2021 yeah so

1205
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,240
i i would even

1206
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,000
say probably um until mid 2021 at the

1207
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,960
earliest

1208
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,839
uh like it's not gonna happen until like

1209
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,359
we actually get a vaccine and there's a

1210
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,040
way to

1211
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,760
yeah um general availability of bad the

1212
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,200
vaccine i think is going to be the thing

1213
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,079
i think it takes

1214
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,040
uh from tip to tail like at least at at

1215
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,560
least 14 months

1216
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,200
and i think they started we don't we

1217
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,640
don't need a vaccine

1218
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,119
um the just the presence of

1219
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,520
therapeutics that are enough to minimize

1220
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,119
the effects of the disease to the extent

1221
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,000
where hospitalization is minimalized i

1222
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,640
think that

1223
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,480
that's that's definitely going to happen

1224
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,000
way before we have a vaccine

1225
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,920
and everybody's focusing on this vaccine

1226
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,720
and it's like ah

1227
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,599
never exist right now they can't even

1228
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,280
find enough samples to keep working on

1229
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,240
the vaccine

1230
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,440
as as the weeks go by the

1231
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,920
time frame for vaccine gets pushed out

1232
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,680
farther and farther just

1233
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,880
just due to the sheer lack of samples

1234
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,839
well if if i'm reading correctly because

1235
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,200
obviously it mutates

1236
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,440
uh are they able to keep up with like

1237
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,960
mutations like if this is if this is

1238
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,400
this going to be like a vaccine once we

1239
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,920
get it it's going to mutate too much to

1240
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,640
even

1241
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,119
be able to it depends it depends on the

1242
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,240
annotation

1243
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,160
yeah because i know we've already i know

1244
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,760
that they are aware of some mutations

1245
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,560
already

1246
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,480
one of the reasons a vaccine normally

1247
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,839
takes

1248
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,880
uh 10 to 20 years

1249
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,960
is uh due to that

1250
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,800
dude like confirming you have one that's

1251
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,560
going to take care of all forms of it

1252
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,599
you know not and not every virus can

1253
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,480
have a vaccine ever made like it's not

1254
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:58,960
like a

1255
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,160
it's not a matter of wealth you put

1256
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,680
enough time and money on it everything

1257
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,119
can have a vaccine like that's just not

1258
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,359
the case

1259
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,760
um for me though the concern at least

1260
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,720
for therapeutics

1261
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,359
uh is there isn't necessarily a lot of

1262
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,359
knowledge about the long-term effects so

1263
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,280
even if hospitalizations aren't bad

1264
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,560
or um deaths uh

1265
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,560
like if we have a therapeutic uh

1266
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,079
schedule right that can

1267
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,000
make it so the deaths are minimized but

1268
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,280
like you still have people that for

1269
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,400
months afterwards

1270
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,440
having quote unquote recovered

1271
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,680
can't like go up and down stairs without

1272
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,440
getting winded they can't

1273
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,880
let's do the damage that the virus

1274
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,760
caused from being a logic yes so long

1275
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,079
exactly like it's it's well and nearly

1276
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,680
everyone who dies from covid like they

1277
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,599
they don't die because the the infection

1278
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,359
they died because of secondary effects

1279
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,880
of the infection

1280
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,640
that's why you know most people who are

1281
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,160
dying were people with

1282
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,160
poor like limited access to health care

1283
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,760
their whole lives poor cardiovascular

1284
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,680
health etc

1285
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,839
i do so i do a lot of work with an

1286
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,240
organization called get us ppe so i'm

1287
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,040
i'm just perpetually in contact with

1288
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,880
medical facilities and professionals

1289
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,920
which is where i get a lot of my

1290
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,119
opinions from

1291
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,680
oh that's that's that's great that's

1292
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,560
what so

1293
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,960
what what do you what do you do with the

1294
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,160
uh the ppe

1295
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,280
folks get people ppe source and

1296
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,680
distribute personally i distribute um

1297
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,359
literally i get on my motorcycle and i

1298
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,280
take it from point a to point b

1299
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,440
uh because we one of the biggest

1300
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,960
problems going on in the country

1301
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,000
is uh even though we have finally gotten

1302
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,079
to the point in most states where the lo

1303
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,079
the state governments are able to source

1304
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,599
the necessary ppe for the medical

1305
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,280
facilities um

1306
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,000
the distribution within the states is

1307
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,200
[ __ ] terrible um it's highly targeted

1308
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,440
it's based off of the wrong data

1309
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,960
uh like they're uh because

1310
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,880
you know kovid affects

1311
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,480
uh almost like

1312
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,520
in so in chicago 73 of

1313
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,880
all coveted deaths are black folks um

1314
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,400
it it disproportionately hits uh black

1315
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,040
folks

1316
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,400
more than any more than even latinos um

1317
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,480
and of course white's the least and that

1318
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,720
has to do with act with lifetime access

1319
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,920
to health care

1320
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,480
um folks who have had unhealthy lives

1321
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,359
due to

1322
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,559
systematic racism etc um are at high

1323
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,000
risk for death from covid because

1324
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,920
of the long-term effects that not being

1325
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,760
able to get medical attention cause or

1326
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,119
even just had proper healthcare

1327
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,240
education

1328
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,720
uh because but what the states are often

1329
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,800
doing is they're sending this ppe to

1330
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,280
hospitals based on the number of just

1331
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,520
patients they had last year

1332
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,440
and so okay you had this many patients

1333
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,720
last year you

1334
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,119
if you had 40 of all the patients in the

1335
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,160
state you'll get 40

1336
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,240
of the ppe here you go whereas what

1337
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,839
really needs to happen is the hospitals

1338
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,280
in the very low income

1339
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,599
areas that have often you know have the

1340
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,440
high percentages of

1341
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,520
those most heavily affected by covid and

1342
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,280
the most the highest coveted cases those

1343
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,480
are the ones that actually need to get

1344
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,000
all the pve but they're not getting it

1345
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,440
because they don't

1346
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,040
historically have the the numbers

1347
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,400
to support that uh but now they do

1348
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,559
but they're going based off of like last

1349
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,640
year's numbers and so these hospitals

1350
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,800
aren't getting the quantity of ppe that

1351
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,160
they actually need to protect their

1352
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,079
doctors and protect their patients that

1353
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:20,880
aside

1354
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,760
the states aren't providing ppe to every

1355
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,839
other form of facility that takes in

1356
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,280
people off the streets be it

1357
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,160
nursing homes be it safe houses halfway

1358
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:30,720
houses

1359
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,839
those don't get [ __ ] you know and they

1360
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,200
like they're on their own like well go

1361
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:35,839
to the store and

1362
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,480
go buy some have you been to a store

1363
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,079
have you tried to buy some it's not

1364
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:40,880
there

1365
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,680
and when it is there a box of 50 gloves

1366
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,520
is 30

1367
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,920
a box of 100 masks is thirty dollars

1368
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,359
it's insane

1369
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:50,720
and these places don't have any money so

1370
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,640
what we're doing at get us ppe

1371
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,040
is finding places that have extra pep i

1372
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,800
literally i pick up from veterinarians a

1373
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,760
lot

1374
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,000
we go to vets pick up gloves and masks

1375
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,960
and then we take those

1376
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,040
and i dropped it off a couple weeks ago

1377
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,119
i had to go to a battered women's

1378
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,720
shelter in indiana and drop it off and

1379
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,160
so that's what we're doing

1380
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,599
because nobody else is doing it and i'm

1381
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,520
happy to do it and i get to go out on my

1382
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,319
motorcycle

1383
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:15,280
you know it's not a huge burden but i'm

1384
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,520
helping uh but because of that i talk to

1385
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,680
tons of doctors about what's going on

1386
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,599
what they think is happening

1387
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,440
when i talk to hospitals to get back on

1388
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,280
track um

1389
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,960
the hospital's here all of the internal

1390
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,720
memos the nutritional conversation

1391
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,400
is the the resurgence in september

1392
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,079
um there will be a massive spike at

1393
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,000
least here in chicago in september

1394
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,119
it's being spoken of as a guarantee

1395
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,440
that the words possibly are never used

1396
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,800
they never talk about it like

1397
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,960
if the spike happens if the suspected

1398
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,000
spike is coming

1399
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,280
it's never everyone is preparing for

1400
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,440
the second wave in september it is

1401
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,839
happening

1402
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:57,280
illinois i guess

1403
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,440
you guys are doing way better way better

1404
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,720
than us oh we are

1405
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,160
crushing it um our governor is doing an

1406
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,040
excellent job

1407
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,240
our governor is awful he

1408
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,960
literally he did like a recent interview

1409
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,640
and he's just he's

1410
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,480
he's leaving everything to the cities to

1411
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,480
decide on their own and he openly said

1412
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,960
that it is

1413
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,040
he will not in any shape way or form

1414
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,960
mandate mass for the state

1415
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,319
because he believes that it is

1416
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,559
everybody's freedom to choose whether

1417
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,319
they should wear a mask and he

1418
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,760
he's deciding he doesn't want to wear a

1419
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,319
mask oh what a piece of [ __ ] that's like

1420
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,720
sweet i can't believe how i can't

1421
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,160
believe i'm politicized

1422
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,839
wearing a mask you're not wearing a mask

1423
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:39,920
because become it's it's it's ridiculous

1424
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,599
yeah i'm so glad that i live in like

1425
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,640
the one of two blue sections in this

1426
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,000
stupid state because

1427
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
they actually care we just finally

1428
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,400
forced masks

1429
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,599
yeah like chicago is like one of the

1430
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,599
only blue sections you know the the

1431
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,119
upside is the rest of the state has no

1432
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:59,119
population to say anything so

1433
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,720
um yeah it's it's it's the same thing

1434
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,240
that elections do where they allow you

1435
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:04,720
to

1436
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,880
they they cause people to broadcast

1437
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,960
loudly what pieces of [ __ ] they are

1438
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,040
uh and so like the upside is like well

1439
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,319
you know you get to go through your

1440
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,400
friends list once a year and go okay

1441
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,160
cool i didn't know that you were just

1442
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,680
you you cared so little about your

1443
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,040
friends or family that you're willing to

1444
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,920
kill them

1445
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,680
just so uh you don't have a minor

1446
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,240
inconvenience that's insane

1447
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,960
yeah and like people like come on don't

1448
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,720
i can't believe it's july and like

1449
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,160
people don't understand what the purpose

1450
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,760
of the mask is by now like you [ __ ]

1451
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,800
kidding me

1452
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,599
we get people on a regular basis who are

1453
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:36,880
confused

1454
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,400
uh like we get people obviously who

1455
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,520
don't want to wear masks but then

1456
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,640
because we're enforcing we've been

1457
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,079
enforcing them in our business since day

1458
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,839
one of reopening for us

1459
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,280
but like people come in they're confused

1460
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,040
they're like i don't understand

1461
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,119
like why are we wearing masks and i'm

1462
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,520
like where where have you been

1463
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,280
after a while now you literally can't

1464
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,720
walk down the street here without being

1465
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,480
informed of it it's taped to the [ __ ]

1466
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,920
light poles people are taping

1467
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,440
like you cannot walk down a street

1468
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,319
without being accidentally educated on

1469
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,280
what's up

1470
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,160
yeah what's your problem like we're

1471
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,040
literally like

1472
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,119
like i can't even ignorance can't do

1473
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,160
this because you're

1474
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,440
seeing it you're it's right in front of

1475
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,280
your eyes that you don't know

1476
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,559
that's what's happening there and you're

1477
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,559
just like and yet

1478
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,800
so like you get women who will get

1479
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,680
uppity about

1480
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,760
having to wear a mask but they'll still

1481
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,800
wear a bra

1482
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,000
for like much a much less important

1483
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,240
reason

1484
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,119
are you [ __ ] kidding me or something

1485
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,319
you know that's something about beliefs

1486
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,760
people just double down on what they

1487
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,359
already believe instead of changing

1488
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,119
their beliefs because of evidence you

1489
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:39,680
know

1490
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,200
it's nuts well it's not a belief thing

1491
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,960
well i mean it's it's a lot of the

1492
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,480
people they're listening

1493
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,280
to i don't know like right-wing radio

1494
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,960
stations that are telling them that this

1495
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,960
is all [ __ ] and it's like you know i

1496
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,599
feel like those

1497
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,280
people are few and far between they're

1498
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,800
just loud yeah

1499
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,359
yeah i hope i mean that's that's kind of

1500
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:00,960
the trouble is it's really

1501
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,200
kind of hard to tell like who do who's

1502
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,640
really like

1503
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,400
getting all their information it's a

1504
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,319
liberal conspiracy and like

1505
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,720
i'm i'm pretty [ __ ] liberal and i

1506
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,480
haven't i haven't been informed of this

1507
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,760
conspiracy yet

1508
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,680
like i'm not necessarily against i might

1509
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,040
be on board show me

1510
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,040
email me you're obviously if you are on

1511
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,119
the committee

1512
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,200
you're a conspirator on your motorcycle

1513
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,720
delivering all that ppe

1514
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,119
i mean come on i would like to be more

1515
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,559
of a conspirator

1516
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,760
like um what's up

1517
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,839
i wanted to back it up on something that

1518
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,359
you mentioned before

1519
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,640
what are therapeutics is that like

1520
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,200
uh true therapy animals no drugs

1521
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,319
what kind of drugs like are working to

1522
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,359
minimize the uh

1523
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,960
the symptoms nothing so far um

1524
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,000
but they're you know there's

1525
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,760
therapeutics for there's therapeutics

1526
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,720
for the common cold

1527
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,000
you know so um stuff like that yeah so

1528
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,400
there's therapeutics for

1529
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,960
the many flus like you ever have tamiflu

1530
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,240
you ever get the flu and then the

1531
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,720
doctor prescribed you tamiflu or it's a

1532
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,319
therapeutic it doesn't it doesn't it's

1533
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:13,040
not a cure

1534
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,920
it doesn't destroy the virus does this

1535
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,319
work

1536
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,680
or um it varies

1537
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,160
it varies by virus and infection in

1538
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,319
person but sometimes it works enough

1539
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:24,800
that

1540
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,359
that doctors prescribe it okay um i've

1541
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:28,000
never been

1542
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,960
prescribed uh tamiflu i have uh zpac is

1543
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,240
another thing that's mostly i think

1544
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,599
therapeutic right

1545
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,319
uh z-pec is an antibacterial you're

1546
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,839
right it is

1547
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,680
one of the problems with viruses is

1548
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,000
there's it you can't really medicate a

1549
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,119
way of

1550
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,240
viruses um right they're two and it's

1551
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:48,880
because they're

1552
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,480
too simple of creatures

1553
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,359
yeah they're not alive right yeah so the

1554
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,040
way you fight a viral infection

1555
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,319
is you change the chemical makeup

1556
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,559
of the things that they're attacking or

1557
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:04,319
you change the way the things

1558
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,400
they're attacking functions so that the

1559
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,920
functions no longer benefit the

1560
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,599
replication of the virus

1561
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,079
and it's really hard to do that without

1562
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,599
[ __ ] your body up because you're

1563
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,280
talking about like changing

1564
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,559
the chemical makeup of receptors on your

1565
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,400
cell walls and those receptors are there

1566
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,359
for a valid

1567
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,319
reason to receive other things you need

1568
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:25,680
and so then it's a matter of

1569
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,839
can we shut these receptors down for two

1570
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:28,799
weeks and not

1571
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:31,599
kill the person or permanently maim them

1572
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,680
but also then the virus can't replicate

1573
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,000
and it's

1574
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,359
gone and then we can turn the receptors

1575
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,040
back up it's things like that that

1576
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,720
you're dealing with viruses viruses are

1577
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,079
really really freaking

1578
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,640
tricky to fight off and that's what

1579
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,160
we're dealing with um there's a big

1580
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,599
therapeutic that's being pushed right

1581
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,400
now called rem deserver

1582
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,280
was initially created to fight sars and

1583
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:51,839
mers

1584
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,040
if you remember those two i'm sorry

1585
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,119
so this coveted of course being caused

1586
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,720
by sars to

1587
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:03,520
um there's no real clinical data

1588
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,160
showing that rem deserver has any effect

1589
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,119
on

1590
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:10,160
sars slash coven 19 infections

1591
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,200
um but there's but it could

1592
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,599
and it's it's way far ahead in the

1593
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,200
clinical testing trials because

1594
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,119
it's been being tested for years and

1595
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:20,319
years and years

1596
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:23,359
uh so they found that okay it's at least

1597
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,000
fairly safe and we've confirmed that

1598
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,760
let's get out to people let's start

1599
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,760
trying it on people to see if it works

1600
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,960
and so a lot of people are getting real

1601
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,040
excited about bremdezevir saying oh the

1602
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,559
therapeutic it's a drug it's going to

1603
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,520
help but

1604
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,839
there's no evidence of that definitely

1605
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,440
like if a doctor says try it

1606
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,920
certainly try it it might help it might

1607
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,640
work but

1608
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,960
don't get excited that there's a

1609
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,559
therapeutic treatment out there because

1610
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,160
it hasn't been proven yeah

1611
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,640
well um johnny i wanted to walk it back

1612
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,200
to

1613
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,480
your face when i mentioned the oasis and

1614
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,920
uh ready player one and you're like [ __ ]

1615
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,240
that that's never gonna happen what what

1616
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,280
what were you thinking

1617
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,200
i am i am so sick of virtual conferences

1618
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,680
okay i say that as someone whose company

1619
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,040
is hosting their second virtual

1620
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,799
conference this year already

1621
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:19,200
um which are well received

1622
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,559
i'm personally not a fan

1623
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,480
um it's not to say they're not effective

1624
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,480
and don't provide you know a wealth of

1625
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,200
education

1626
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,720
etc um i i feel the entire reason that

1627
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,720
conferences were created

1628
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,480
was you know we if you want to go back

1629
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,119
to the days of like comdex

1630
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,640
and things like that the entire reason

1631
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,000
they're created is to get a bunch of

1632
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,119
people who

1633
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,200
uh like the same stuff together to meet

1634
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,400
up in person and talk and have

1635
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,680
conversations and stuff

1636
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,520
and the big problem with these virtual

1637
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,440
conferences that are hosted on

1638
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,640
platforms like zoom and and uh like we

1639
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,280
just

1640
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,799
call everything zoom is becoming you

1641
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:56,480
bigger as household name no matter what

1642
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,400
kind of webinar system you're using it's

1643
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,280
zoom way to zoom let's do a zoom how did

1644
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,079
skype

1645
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,680
drop the ball on that one they're like

1646
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,599
way ahead of the game and then they

1647
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,280
because they changed it to teams and

1648
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,200
like they changed the name five times

1649
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,880
it's live and then it's teams

1650
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,240
and yeah um yeah skype

1651
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,119
skype had it but skype built that

1652
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,359
ubiquity before microsoft bought that as

1653
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:20,240
well yeah yeah

1654
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,640
and then microsoft dropped that ball um

1655
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,599
so

1656
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,559
this is good when you need to have i'd

1657
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:27,599
say maximum

1658
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,000
five people to have a conversation and

1659
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,440
get some things done it's great for

1660
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,480
business meetings

1661
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,079
because even in person more than five

1662
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,599
people at a work meeting doesn't get

1663
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:36,799
anywhere anyway

1664
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:40,000
um it doesn't work for like you have

1665
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,880
people trying to do

1666
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,160
uh parties and stuff uh over

1667
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,920
zoom and saying like oh we're having

1668
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,240
like grab a drink and hang out yeah on

1669
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,119
thursday

1670
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,160
and you'll have 50 people in a

1671
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,280
in a webcast all here

1672
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,920
all yelling over each other like that's

1673
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,799
not how

1674
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:02,160
social gatherings work right that's how

1675
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,720
social gatherings that don't work

1676
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,119
but like social gatherings you get 50

1677
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,400
100 people and i'm talking like our

1678
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,839
meetups and things like that in a room

1679
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:12,160
and you break off into small groups of

1680
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,440
three four five and you have a

1681
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,359
conversation over here now

1682
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:18,480
what uh infosec oasis and thoughtcon

1683
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,920
have been doing is they're using

1684
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,760
a system called all space vr which

1685
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,280
actually is owned by microsoft now

1686
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,960
yeah to uh not surprised but really yeah

1687
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,720
uh to uh host these gatherings and alt

1688
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,240
space is really cool

1689
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,119
and also there's a vr chat uh that's

1690
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,079
kind of like second

1691
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,480
life and fire called it's called just vr

1692
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,680
chat i think it's called

1693
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,520
it's really cool and it works really

1694
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,200
well because it does a lot of the

1695
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,359
audio manipulation to where if you walk

1696
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:48,880
away from a group

1697
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,000
there that audio level drops and if like

1698
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:52,400
you're

1699
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,160
and you can they have positional audio

1700
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,160
and volume so if somebody's talking

1701
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,480
behind you to the right even in just

1702
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,160
stereo headphones you hear that you pick

1703
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,359
up on it you can turn around and see

1704
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:02,640
them and they're right there

1705
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,559
and also what's really cool about that

1706
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,079
is if there's a group of people talking

1707
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:06,559
and they're just

1708
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:08,160
out of your shot you can hear that you

1709
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,680
can kind of hear the mumbles

1710
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,200
and you can tell where they're at and if

1711
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,559
you're alone in a room you could be like

1712
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:14,240
someone let me go see what they're doing

1713
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,440
or i thought i think i heard somebody

1714
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,559
talking about something i'm into i'm

1715
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:17,599
going to walk over there

1716
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,359
see and that's how real conversation

1717
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:20,640
happens that's how real social

1718
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,520
interaction happens

1719
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,520
and that's why that's really cool the

1720
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,640
downside to that is

1721
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,000
these systems have extremely limited

1722
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,680
caps on how many people they can host at

1723
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,119
any given time

1724
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,760
um i think absolute max in all space vr

1725
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,880
was like

1726
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,400
at 30 you start getting serious

1727
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,079
performance degradation yeah

1728
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:41,280
at 50. it's almost unusable

1729
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,480
uh so you can't even have a small

1730
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,480
conference that's there well the cool

1731
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,559
thing that they did for infosec oasis

1732
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:51,119
is they were able to clone rooms so you

1733
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,280
could have 30 people fill up a room

1734
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,440
and then once they hit 30 they cloned it

1735
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,200
right another 30 people but everyone's

1736
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,799
seen the speaker

1737
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,799
right but it's a crap shoot of which 30

1738
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,160
people you're hanging out with

1739
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,720
yeah but it's during the talk you know

1740
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,000
so then they have like other

1741
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,760
like lobby spaces or whatever where

1742
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,000
people can hang out yeah um

1743
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,359
and also presenting in vr is tricky

1744
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:15,200
infosec oasis did come up with a cool

1745
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,400
solution

1746
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,240
um and i've seen i've been watching

1747
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,520
concerts in alt space

1748
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,000
which is really fun yeah i have to i've

1749
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,440
been going to like open mics and stuff

1750
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,720
i've been experimenting with it i've

1751
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,640
been i've been having fun with it i

1752
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,079
um i i'm working on a

1753
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,720
project for burning man for it right now

1754
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,680
um

1755
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,599
because you can burning man's like one

1756
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:36,720
of the

1757
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,440
actually it got bought it's funny i hung

1758
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,000
up uh

1759
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,920
hearing the story that they got bought

1760
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,000
by microsoft and the deal was done

1761
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,400
at burning man and so it's like very

1762
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,839
like burning man friendly so they're

1763
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:48,960
doing like this burning

1764
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,200
thing like burning man definitely turned

1765
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,079
into the

1766
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,400
place where rich people go to experience

1767
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,359
what being poor is like

1768
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:58,960
it really is like it's like because they

1769
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,400
can't get that experience in their own

1770
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:00,880
life

1771
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,400
they can't get the experience of like

1772
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,000
money not mattering and so they go to

1773
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,440
burning man to be forced into that

1774
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,480
scenario

1775
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,599
yeah it's uh yeah the the

1776
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,520
the harsh environment there is the the

1777
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,280
great equalizer because everyone's got

1778
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,440
to figure out how to deal with it

1779
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,880
um so the there's still a downside to

1780
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,160
these vr spaces

1781
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,160
aside from just like the limited user

1782
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,680
base is you have that

1783
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,200
that barrier to entry you have that

1784
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,359
technological barrier um yes you can use

1785
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,119
things like alt space via pc and it's

1786
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,280
cool that they tried to do that

1787
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,400
it's not as easy you don't get a lot of

1788
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,359
the interactivity

1789
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:38,160
you don't you can't emote like you can

1790
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,079
with

1791
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,000
my setup here with your with your hands

1792
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,119
like you can vr

1793
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:44,559
so if you're talking to someone on a pc

1794
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,480
they're just this robot who's talking to

1795
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,480
you like this that's really weird um

1796
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,520
and you need you still need

1797
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,880
some kind of decent hardware to even run

1798
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,760
the 3d

1799
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,359
environments that are going on there and

1800
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,920
you know there's a ton of people who

1801
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,599
don't have access to that

1802
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,760
or just choose not to have access to

1803
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,039
that and aren't going to go

1804
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:10,160
buy a set up just to be able to do that

1805
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:10,880
you know

1806
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,039
i know plenty of people who have a

1807
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,880
six-year-old eight-year-old laptop

1808
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,039
that work in information security and

1809
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:18,880
are you know working offensive security

1810
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,720
go this thing works fine for me

1811
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,400
i don't need anything more why would i

1812
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,920
bother wasting my money and i totally

1813
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,119
get it

1814
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:26,319
you can get by really far on a

1815
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:27,920
chromebook these days but it's not going

1816
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,400
to be

1817
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,960
health space well i just bought my mom a

1818
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,720
chromebook and i was super worried that

1819
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,920
it was going to be a nightmare

1820
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,000
and that hasn't on the flip side of that

1821
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,119
though like

1822
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,520
buying a plane ticket getting a hotel

1823
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,720
and going to a con

1824
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,520
you know costs i mean you can expense

1825
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,000
those things

1826
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,319
against your company yeah well maybe

1827
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:47,839
somebody gonna buy you a vr head that's

1828
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:48,559
what i'm saying

1829
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:52,079
i have the company buy a vr headset

1830
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,520
your company's not gonna do that because

1831
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,200
then that becomes a company asset and

1832
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,720
then they have to go and collect those

1833
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,640
when everybody quits and then

1834
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,559
they're stuck with these vr headsets

1835
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:02,079
yeah yeah

1836
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,720
sure someone who doesn't who doesn't

1837
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,400
have a job that would ever pay for

1838
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,280
hackercon

1839
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,640
i i do it every hopes one of the best

1840
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,480
things ever because i will spit out that

1841
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,680
money it's usually about a thousand

1842
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,400
dollars

1843
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,480
all together travel staying all that

1844
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,400
stuff and i do it hands down

1845
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,079
i don't have an issue doing it because i

1846
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,440
get to sit around

1847
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,680
with alcohol in my hand and people

1848
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,079
around me to talk for hours

1849
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:28,799
and it's great you may you meet amazing

1850
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:30,559
people a significant portion of people

1851
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:31,760
look good at those cons

1852
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,319
out of pocket for sure and spend very

1853
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:36,079
little sometimes

1854
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,200
my first hope i had

1855
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,359
93 dollars in my bank account when i

1856
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:42,480
went

1857
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,319
uh i was pretty poor tickets were much

1858
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:45,680
cheaper to hope

1859
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,559
yeah i certainly i i've never bought a

1860
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:49,520
badge for hope

1861
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,559
i'm proud to say

1862
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:55,359
i've only not bought in twice that was a

1863
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,280

1867
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:04,960
willing to give me some badges all the

time and that was very cool and this is

1869
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,119

showed me when i came over to his house

1878
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,000
and he was my friend where we like he

1879
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,440
was the only other hacker i knew and we

1880
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:25,760
would

1881
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,400
hack on like satellite tv and stuff and

1882
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,520
our cell phones

1883

and he we so we both read 2600 and had

1884
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:33,119
been for years and he goes hey did you

1885
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:34,480
see this and it was a page all the way

1886
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,079
at the end of the magazine that quarter

1887
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:37,359
it said

1888
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:40,559

over a thousand hackers get together to

1892
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,720

1893
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,480
and i was reading this and i go and i

1894
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,000
literally said to him i go

1895
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,720
there's no there's probably kind of like

1896
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,720
this right

1897
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,640
i mean this is for this year's like it's

1898
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,839
at the end of the day

1899
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:01,599
yeah it was exactly that's like it's

1900
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,960
like hey this is hope

1901
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,319
this is the thing that's happening a one

1902
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:06,079
page it's like it's literally like the

1903
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:07,680
second to last it's like

1904
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,119
yeah that's exactly what it was and for

1905
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:10,559
how big it is you'd think they'd put it

1906
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,839
like on the cover

1907
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:14,000
um but no and it was and i go to my

1908
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
friend i go there's no [ __ ] way that

1909
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,880
how did the

1910
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,319
how does everyone not get arrested here

1911
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:19,599
how did the police let this happen i had

1912
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:21,599
this exact same reaction

1913
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,599
that everyone who you talked to in the

1914
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,280
elevator had hope who's just a regular

1915
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,880
guest at that hotel

1916
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,799
like what is a bunch of hackers here why

1917
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:30,079
aren't the police here one of the police

1918
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:31,599
arrest all these hackers like that was

1919
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:32,799
my reaction

1920
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:37,359
at age 20 in h in y2k

1921
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:39,760
uh and i went and i had an absolute last

1922
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,039
we we borrowed

1923
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,599
my friend's dad's conversion ban oh you

1924
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:44,720
know i was thinking of starting a

1925
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:45,599
podcast

1926
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,920
uh since defcon is canceled this year

1927
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,119
and i was going to call it on

1928
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:53,359
uh on the way to on the way to defcon

1929
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:54,559
and it was going to be all just

1930
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:55,920
people coming out and telling stories

1931
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,920
about weird ways they've got they've

1932
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,839
gotten to

1933
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:02,079
defcon but my hope when was similar is

1934
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:03,680
we borrowed my dad's

1935
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,839
friend's dad's conversion van took all

1936
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:09,038
the seats out except the

1937
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,559
shotgun and the driver put futons in the

1938
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:13,680
back

1939
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,160
and we loaded up a cooler full of food

1940
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:16,720
because we

1941
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:20,000
didn't have money to stop for food and

1942
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,200
um we we took off and that was it and

1943
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,760
like i had 93

1944
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,160
and we squatted in an nyu dorm that we

1945
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:30,880
broke into

1946
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,240
because it was summer so no one was

1947
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,920
there and

1948
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,359
uh that sunday was actually the start of

1949
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:40,079
uh orientation week and so like we get

1950
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:40,960

01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,359
7 a.m on a sunday after like being up

1952
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,119

1953
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:48,240
whose room this is for the week like oh

1954
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:48,559
we

1955
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:49,839
there must be a mix up we'll go

1956
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:51,119
downstairs and tell them someone's

1957
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,200

1959
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,079
you wait here we'll go hey just one

1960
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:00,720
minute

1961
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,119
and we threw all of our stuff down the

1962
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:04,079
fire escape

1963
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:07,039
uh to avoid getting caught and it was

1964
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,119
pouring outside

1965
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:11,039
and i'm still missing a pair of pants

1966
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:14,559
from that oh

1967
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,799
yeah and so that's like we so you want

1968
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,158
to talk about like oh it

1969
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:20,719
costs the same to go to a con i don't

1970
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:24,080
know man

1971
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:27,920
um yeah um

1972
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,679
yeah i mean i definitely think that

1973
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:30,960
people are going to be getting more

1974
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,560
inventive as time wears on

1975
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,238
um and as things become more accessible

1976
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:37,759
to people like i'm interested to see

1977
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,880
kind of how hubs

1978
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,479
kind of plays out mozilla has hubs which

1979
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:42,319
is kind of like that lvr

1980
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:45,759
but will change the face of technology

1981
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:46,560
on the planet

1982
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,479
for sure and we'll get some amazing

1983
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:51,040
stuff coming out of this horrible time

1984
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,279
and for absolute certainty going forward

1985
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,640
this is going to be able to reach more

1986
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,198
people

1987
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:57,198
and you know when cons can start

1988
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:58,319
actually

1989
01:08:58,319 --> 01:08:59,920
meeting in person and having that all

1990
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,359
happen again you're probably going to

1991
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,439
see even more people attending because

1992
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,120
now they've had the access to

1993
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,279
at least taste part of it as it's been

1994
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:08,238
virtual

1995
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:10,479
perhaps yeah as the infrastructure kind

1996
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:11,839
of builds out i think you'll see more

1997
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,198
and more of that

1998
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:15,198
um but you also have i mean people again

1999
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:16,238
like bunny

2000
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:17,679
bunny doesn't work in information

2001
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:20,000
security yeah um

2002
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,679
bunny is uh works pretty normal

2003
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:26,000
human person she's just works in the

2004
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,960
service industry

2005
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,960
unlike the rest of us and likes board

2006
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,719
games and nerd [ __ ]

2007
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:34,399
and yeah uh so she's like

2008
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:35,839
certainly their company isn't paying her

2009
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,759
to go to cons and also she

2010
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:39,920
i lose money to go because i can't work

2011
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,279
and you wouldn't go to most of these

2012
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:42,640
cons anyway

2013
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,960
but now if they're virtualized you can

2014
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,158
throw them on in the background and

2015
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:47,198
maybe learn something

2016
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:48,960
like it you're opening the door to these

2017
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,479
kinds for people who

2018
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:52,399
uh don't even work in the industry who

2019
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,759
would never go who didn't

2020
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:55,760
perhaps didn't know this stuff even

2021
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,520
existed

2022
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,360
you know yeah like i mean when i when i

2023
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,800
tell people like

2024
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,239
during hope years you know coming up

2025
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,080
like that i'm gonna go to new york city

2026
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,840
for a hacker con everybody's like

2027
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,480
that's a thing like nobody seems to know

2028
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,440
that those exist

2029
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,960
and i'm just like yeah they exist

2030
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,400
they're very awesome i mean like you

2031
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,000
don't have to be a hacker to go like

2032
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:14,840
it's a learning

2033
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,520
experience is really what it is and you

2034
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:17,920
make

2035
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,360
great friends you'll have great

2036
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,760
experiences well and i think a hacker is

2037
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,360
a mindset right you know it's

2038
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,840
more of like you know trying to find

2039
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,400
creative ways to solve problems you know

2040
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,239
yeah it's literally a learning

2041
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:32,159
experience that's what hacking is is

2042
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:34,480
taking a thing and learning about it and

2043
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,000
by learning about it usually you break

2044
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,280
it into pieces and

2045
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,480
put it back together maybe

2046
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,840
possibly you hope to put it back

2047
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,600
together yeah

2048
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:48,400
um so speaking of you know learning and

2049
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,199

the alpha actually just recently and

2100
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:23,679
there's about

2101
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:25,280
20 games in the alpha so they're

2102
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,360
constantly moving new games in

2103
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,280
thanks for sharing that i need to yeah i

2104
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,560
know it's and

2105
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,719
it's constantly busy at all times

2106
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:34,080
because everybody across the world and

2107
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,679
apparently the site's been running for

2108
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:37,679
like five or six years and just

2109
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:39,840
it's now taking off like the uh the

2110
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,360
first two weeks that i was on the site

2111
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,320
it was so hard

2112
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,760
to get once you got logged in you were

2113
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,600
pretty okay uh but

2114
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,520
the site was dropping non-stop and every

2115
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,640
single day they're like we gotta shut

2116
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,400
down we gotta do server maintenance like

2117
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,159
because everybody was just piling on

2118
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,840
because everybody's going under lockdown

2119
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,280
i wonder how many sites are like that

2120
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,120
because of because of coved like

2121
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,400
where they just yeah all of a sudden

2122
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,320
there's huge influx because like people

2123
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,120
are born

2124
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,960
yeah they didn't expect it but i mean

2125
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,880
they're they're doing good now

2126
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,360

2142
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,040
it's the the miller's uh hollow one

2143
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,719
which is a version i wasn't familiar

2144
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,800
with uh but most people know werewolf

2145
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,360
typical

2146
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,480
mafia style good guys versus bad guys

2147
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,000
you vote people off in the day to kill

2148
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,360
them if you're hoping to get a werewolf

2149
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,280
in a werewolf at night you eat

2150
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,600
um it's actually super fun uh there's

2151
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,120
no visual and no talking they do have

2152
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,199
for premium you could start a video chat

2153
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,400
but no one uses it

2154
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,760
because most people a lot of people are

2155
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,600
premium and uh it's

2156
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,239
kind of weird too uh so yeah it's just

2157
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:03,440
all text based

2158
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,440
um they do have on next to each little

2159
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,679
house you're actually in a village

2160
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:10,000
uh it's max 12 players in a village next

2161
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,040
to each house there's like a little

2162
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,320
thumbs up and thumbs down

2163
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,239
so it works out for people i've played

2164
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:16,719
games where no one else spoke english

2165
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:19,199
um that was interesting uh you

2166
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:20,400
essentially

2167
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,000
can just thumbs up and thumbs down

2168
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,719
people so you can

2169
01:14:23,719 --> 01:14:26,239
alert to the rest of the place that you

2170
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:27,600
know hey i think this person's acting a

2171
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,040
little suspect without actually having

2172
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,239
to communicate

2173
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,080
um and actually talk to them but it's

2174
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,679
all through emojis huh

2175
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,840
yeah you can if uh you want like when

2176
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,679
you press like the thumbs down it'll say

2177
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,199
something like i think so and so has

2178
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:40,880
some fur hiding under their clothes

2179
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,199
okay uh it'll say it'll pop up like

2180
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:44,239
there's like three different

2181
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:46,640
auto responses for them but uh but it

2182
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,560
you know passes along and it works out

2183
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,199
for

2184
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:50,400
if you end up in a game where no one

2185
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,840
speaks english with you or speaks the

2186
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,800
same language

2187
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,360
um but yeah you can always text so a lot

2188
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,480
of lights you know you're just in there

2189
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,760
and type it away

2190
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,040
um it works really well i

2191
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,800
i joined thinking this is going to be a

2192
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,400
complete [ __ ] show

2193
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,320
and you know immediately upon joining it

2194
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,440
was actually nice everybody's very

2195
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,640
friendly and they were like immediately

2196
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,280
like oh

2197
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,120
funny because it says like this player's

2198
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,400
never played before it lets you know on

2199
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,040
your first game

2200
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,239
everybody's like oh my god bunny do you

2201
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:15,280
know how to play like you're wearing i'm

2202
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,640
like i've played so much werewolf

2203
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,679
outside this it's

2204
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,520
i'm fine i just don't know how to do

2205
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,440
this without talking to you

2206
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,440
um yeah i played one game and i was like

2207
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,560
actually that

2208
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,679
worked out really well um and so i've

2209
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:28,000
been

2210
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,560
playing non-stop werewolf all the time

2211
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,520
with the

2212
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,640
i've met tons of friends now and uh it's

2213
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,320
really interesting because it the best

2214
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:37,920
thing i like about it is for most people

2215
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:38,560
who aren't

2216
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,600
super familiar with the game um the game

2217
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,880
isn't about

2218
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,440
talking and spying that person who just

2219
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,960
looks guilty in the face

2220
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,719
that's actually not it there's always

2221
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,159
information in these games even when it

2222
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,120
seems like there's not

2223
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,360
and voting is the biggest source of

2224
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,400
information in the game

2225
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,800
and this because all of that talking

2226
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:57,840
face-to-face and

2227
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,239
you're not paying attention to people uh

2228
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:01,760
all you see are votes now you can just

2229
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,199
clearly pay attention to the votes and

2230
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,199
so much information comes out there

2231
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:08,560
and it's really easier i think to play

2232
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,159
online when i'm not talking

2233
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:12,719
than it is in person because you get

2234
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:14,239
distracted by all the visuals that are

2235
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:15,440
happening

2236
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:21,920
and so cool awesome when i was a big uh

2237
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,800
board game fan up until i mean i still

2238
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,400
am but i haven't been able to play many

2239
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,320
board games um and there's

2240
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,040
um there's a tabletop simulator on steam

2241
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,960
as well as another real popular one

2242
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,480
called tabletopia

2243
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,600
where tons of boarding manufacturers are

2244
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,679
uh importing their board games into

2245
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:41,600
these simulators that you can then play

2246
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,920
with friends and so that's pretty cool

2247
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,679
because effectively it's just a physics

2248
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:47,280
engine and then you just import your

2249
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,000
cards and dice

2250
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,199
and crap into this yeah um that's

2251
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:54,000
that's a really good one as well or

2252
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,040
board games and

2253
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,120
jack in the box they have made bang

2254
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,679
checkbox

2255
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,040
freaking expensive jackpots like their

2256
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,000
sales are like

2257
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
they're only thirty dollars you're like

2258
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,679
they uh at the very start

2259
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:09,520
i i opted out to buy in because all my

2260
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:10,800
friends have copies but at the very

2261
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,480
start of lockdown they were dropping

2262
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,840
them and people were available by him

2263
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:14,320
for like

2264
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,080
10 bucks a piece and so a lot of you

2265
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,679
dropped all the crappy ones is what

2266
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:18,320
happened

2267
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,480
um no a lot of my friends were able they

2268
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,920
were just constantly paying attention so

2269
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,199
some of the people got

2270
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:25,199
the newer ones for fairly cheap if you

2271
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:26,480
got them generally through

2272
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,880
jack box like steam never really dropped

2273
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,880
very much i don't like the newer ones

2274
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,800
that's my problem really the newest one

2275
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,480
is the best it has murder party too and

2276
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,080
murder party 2 is hilarious

2277
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,920
it also has the one social deduction

2278
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,199
game that they have which is uh

2279
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:42,719
the alien game uh push the button

2280
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,800

everyone hates that game and i'm the

2285
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,280

not that long ago and everybody had very

2292
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,080
money oriented ones so every single

2293
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,159
drawing was about money and i'm like

2294

01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:15,760
yeah i ended up buying uh like negative

2297
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,320
pretty much amounts like it was horrible

2298
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,040
yeah

2299
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,360
i've only played i played poker

2300
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,880
virtually and we did it through poker

2301
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:23,600
stars

2302
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,080
and then had like a zoom so we could

2303
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,679
like [ __ ] talk and stuff

2304
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:30,400
yeah yeah that was that was fun and it

2305
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,199
was weird

2306
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:32,960
one of my buddies was in seattle and

2307
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,040
apparently in seattle you're not allowed

2308
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,719
to use poker stars

2309
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:39,360
so he vpn through chicago so that he can

2310
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,960
do poker stars

2311
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,880
play poker with no money like we did the

2312
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,000
money through venmo

2313
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,600
so it's like right so anyway it was uh

2314
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,440
it was a little ridiculous but we we

2315
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,440
made it work but i got some friends that

2316
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,320
always want to play

2317
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,120
uh katan like where we both have boards

2318
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:55,679
um

2319
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:58,320
check out it's a site i don't i don't

2320
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,120
want to do that

2321
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,600
no that's there's virtual there's katan

2322
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,560
vr now

2323
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,400
which is just if you feel like wearing a

2324
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,000
vr mask

2325
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,840
we're missing the big point everybody

2326
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,760
realizes niantic is dropping their next

2327
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,239
game

2328
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:13,199
right and that's what are you going to

2329
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,320
play with

2330
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,159
i don't know i don't i'm not i actually

2331
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:17,920
stopped playing i stopped playing

2332
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:18,960
pokemon go

2333
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,480
so i'm not going to play in katan

2334
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,840
but yeah they're dropping it it's the

2335
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,360
next game the harry potter one's been

2336
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,960
out for a while now and it's going well

2337
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,640
and so now they're gonna drop it and i

2338
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,520
don't understand

2339
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,719
because like my friend said i was like

2340
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:32,560
great so i can walk around and offer

2341
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,920
wood for sheep

2342
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,239
like here i have some wood for you can i

2343
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:37,280
have your sheep

2344
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,840
we do just like like a pokemon like you

2345
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,679
can run into strangers and you're not

2346
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:43,280
saying really weird things to them

2347
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,880
except for like hey you want to do this

2348
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:45,520
raid

2349
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,679
uh and said i'm just going to meet

2350
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:48,880
people in the street and be like can i

2351
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,000
have your sheep

2352
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,679
like katana is already a very boring

2353
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:53,360
game a little bit

2354
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,320
it's not the most but it does go too

2355
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,280
long for the

2356
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,560
for the experience certainly i don't

2357
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,320
want to go walk around outside

2358
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,679
and just trying to find somebody giving

2359
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,440
you some sheep i'm like holy [ __ ] but

2360
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,960
niantic is doing it

2361
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,480
it's supposed to be released i think

2362
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,560
here like in the next month

2363
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,639
literally all of that sounds like a

2364
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,239
terrible idea

2365
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:14,960
it sounds like the worst time yeah i

2366
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:15,920
mean

2367
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,400
definitely that but also like yeah katan

2368
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,199
isn't the most

2369
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:21,280
exciting or interesting in my opinion

2370
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,679
yeah i mean it's not the worst game

2371
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:27,040
is the modern monopoly see i like um

2372
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,360
yeah okay i like risk a lot but like

2373
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,120
nobody likes to cause that one is like

2374
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,080
an all-night game

2375
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,440
you know you have to play for a long

2376
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,280
time but uh

2377
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,880
katana i mean you can get it down in an

2378
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,400
hour

2379
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,440
no sometimes not if you're playing with

2380
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:45,040
seven people and three of them

2381
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,199
true but if before get like a full game

2382
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:48,480
it takes a lot of time if you're doing

2383
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,320
competitive katan yeah

2384
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:53,199
it's one-on-one pros and you get a

2385
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:53,840
40-minute

2386
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,320
i i always like to suggest carcassonne

2387
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,920
for the starter games

2388
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,159
instead of getting people in contain

2389
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:01,040
sure

2390
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:04,320
yeah i think because carcassonne is it's

2391
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,120
about the same

2392
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,639
i feel like the same style like the same

2393
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:08,400
concept it's easy to get

2394
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,320
and kind of go with but then once you

2395
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,000
learn it there's fun strategies and the

2396
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:12,960
farmers really

2397
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,960
up the gay once you understand farmers

2398
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,400
but the game doesn't take

2399
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,760
hours and so now that used to be

2400
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,480
uh me and my wife would play that over

2401
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,760
lunch

2402
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,800
oh dropping the wife like oh yeah i got

2403
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,760
a wife

2404
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:31,199
sorry ladies beaches is taken yeah wow

2405
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:33,199
we're just i'm just trying to be

2406
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:35,199
friendly with the board games

2407
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:38,239
well something no oh sorry i got a wife

2408
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:40,000
well so the the point that i was gonna

2409
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,520
make is that like so

2410
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,239
um we used to live in a town that was

2411
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:45,520
like the middle of nowhere two square

2412
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,400
miles

2413
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,639
uh and so we had a bunch of board games

2414
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:50,080
and stuff but like most board games

2415
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,000
aren't two-player

2416
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,120
so you're like all right do you want to

2417
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:56,559
play chess uh

2418
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,400
or they say they're two-player and it's

2419
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,400
like it like really plays bad

2420
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,560
two-player yeah you can technically do

2421
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,760
this but it's terrible

2422
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,199
um but uh yeah so parkinson's

2423
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:12,400
great uh the solitaire games the games

2424
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:16,239
beaches go get uh go get onitama

2425
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:18,080
for a good two player game it's only two

2426
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,560
player it's a fun take on chess

2427
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,960
looks really cute get a little mad near

2428
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,719
these little people it's a fun take on

2429
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:25,520
chess

2430
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,840
and it works

2431
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:33,440
i t-a-m-a okay let's talk

2432
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,560
favorite solitaire games

2433
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,159
board games that have a one player

2434
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,880
option so magic maze

2435
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,639
is this crazy game i don't know if you

2436
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:44,080
all know about this game i bought it

2437
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,679
uh ages ago after getting to play it at

2438
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:47,760
a board game conference

2439
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,199
uh they actually just dropped it on

2440
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:50,800
alpha and board game arena so

2441
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:53,120
you can play it solo it's actually

2442
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,000
easier

2443
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,679
in solo because you don't have to rely

2444
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:58,320
on other people but it's a great game

2445
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,000
in general it plays i think you can do

2446
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
like 10 people max or something it's

2447
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,760
very panicky um

2448
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,080
what do we call it's like panic mode or

2449
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,560
stress mode on panic like it's

2450
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,840
yeah you just kind of lose your mind

2451
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,199
because the game's played in silence i

2452
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:12,800
should note that

2453
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,400
there's no talking that sounds very fun

2454
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,360
but you have a time it's a timed game

2455
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:20,000
and you

2456
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,960
as a group it's all co it's a co-op as a

2457
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,639
group you have to essentially you're in

2458
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:26,000
a mall it's a funny theme you're in a

2459
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,920
mall trying to steal items and exit

2460
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,040
so in the first round you as a team have

2461
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,800
to take four meeples get them to the

2462
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,040
item spots and then

2463
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,400
round two starts and you have to get to

2464
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,480
the exit spots your times

2465
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,520
on this and no one can talk and

2466
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,760
you each of you has a specific movement

2467
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,520
so you can obviously move up down left

2468
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,000
or right

2469
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,360
someone can use a search function

2470
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,719
someone can use portals and someone's

2471
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,239
can use escalators

2472
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:51,760
on a smaller games you have multiple

2473
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,520
movements so i could maybe be the only

2474
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,880
person that can move left

2475
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,719
i think you have a specific like a mall

2476
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:58,320
version because i'm seeing like magic

2477
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,560
maze on mars i'm seeing magic maze and

2478
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,639
it has like

2479
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,600
the original like just magic maze itself

2480
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,159
is the

2481
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:10,080
this theme is a mall and you're grabbing

2482
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,000
items and running

2483
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,480
uh yes okay it's hard to tell that's an

2484
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,000
escalator i'm looking at the box

2485
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,040
art got it it's a

2486
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,520
it's a white the white box but yeah no

2487
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,800
it's actually really fun game

2488
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,600
can be played solo however i do say it's

2489
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,280
easy mode on solo because

2490
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:30,320
you control everything so all it's just

2491
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,840
you fighting against the timer which is

2492
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,120
still very short

2493
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,679
um but it is a solar game that is fun to

2494
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:36,320
play

2495
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:39,280
and you if you have it it can play it's

2496
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,840
at least 10 people if not more

2497
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:45,520
uh wow that's cool i uh

2498
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,679
it's super panic but it is a good game

2499
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:48,639
and i've

2500
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:50,400
i've been alpha testing and i'm using

2501
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,080
the longest time frame because the moves

2502
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,080
are still weird since it's on a computer

2503
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,639
but in the regular time frame i'm still

2504
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:58,880
panicked playing it solo

2505
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,000
so what's the what's the game i'm

2506
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,679
thinking about the one with it's like a

2507
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:05,840
wooden triangle and it's got like golf

2508
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,480
tees

2509
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:09,280
and it has like one that's missing

2510
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,239
you're looking at the one

2511
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:12,080
yeah you're an ignoramus you're an

2512
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,320
ignoramus if you don't do very well

2513
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,080
uh that's out of all cracker barrels

2514
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,400
it's like cracker rails

2515
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:21,360
it's really easy uh as a kid as a very

2516
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,000
young kid

2517
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,679
you just have to leave there's just the

2518
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:25,040
one specific hole you just leave that

2519
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,800
one empty and it's like a rubik's cube

2520
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,400
once you do it one time you're like

2521
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,800
oh i can't do that and i can't do a

2522
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,600
rubik's cube

2523
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,080
i i can't i can't yeah it's a game that

2524
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,199
once you figure it out

2525
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:37,600
it's then you got it then yeah it's not

2526
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,840
really fun anymore

2527
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,760
all right i found magic maze for 15

2528
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,280
bucks there you go yeah it should be

2529
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,800
fairly cheap i bought it uh

2530
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,199
two awesome two years ago like when it

2531
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:50,960

2532
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,080

they just announced it they were trying

2544
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:11,679
to hope they can push it and it didn't

2545
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:12,080
work

2546
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:13,679
you go to you go to gen con to play

2547
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:15,040
board games like you're not like they're

2548
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,480
trying to virtualize it and they're

2549
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,560
doing it but like

2550
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,760
i i know i mean so for the board games

2551
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:22,000
like

2552
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,679
i'm just interested to see how it don't

2553
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:25,360
happen

2554
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:28,080
did you see have you done true dungeon

2555
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,199
yeah

2556
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:31,360
the the virtual true dungeon seems

2557
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,520
interesting not as fun

2558
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,600
i mean i don't necessarily disagree with

2559
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,360
you but it does seem interesting and it

2560
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,800
seems like it could be fun

2561
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,800
i could get way more fun virtual true

2562
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,960
dungeons like i can just go to the games

2563
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,520
the app store and buy them on my quest

2564
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,280
like

2565
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:50,000

2571
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,040

2572

2576
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:09,600
of like hey can we try to get

2577
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,120
the same group of people a lot of us are

2578
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,280
all locals and trying to get it together

2579
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,760
as a virtual and i was just like i mean

2580
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,440
i basically have done that my entire

2581
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,800
lockdown it's just you know line and

2582
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,000
play games with people

2583
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
and often we're over like in discord on

2584
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,600
voice chat or whatever together talking

2585
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,719
anyway so

2586
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:26,560
you don't want more of that yeah it's

2587
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,320
just the same thing i've been doing

2588
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,840
and that's that's a big part of it is

2589
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,520
like oh these virtual conferences

2590
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,600
well we're everything we're doing is all

2591
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,639
of our interactions

2592
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:36,159
is virtual right now we like we don't

2593
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:37,679
get it we used to get excited about

2594
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:39,040
going to a conference we're not excited

2595
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,400
about going to virtual conferences it

2596
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,080
feels like work it literally feels like

2597
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:42,719
work

2598
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:44,320
i've signed up for two that i never even

2599
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,760
logged in for because i was like i do

2600
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:46,000
not

2601
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,280
i just have no interest in this [ __ ] um

2602
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:50,960
i got my other stuff i'm doing man i've

2603
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,239
been doing so many home improvement

2604
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:54,400
projects i've been repairing

2605
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,320
all of the broken stuff that's been

2606
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,920
piling up here forever that i

2607
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:01,520
didn't want to sit and waste a day

2608
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,960
of just sitting and fixing this thing

2609
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,239
but you know what i did to motivate

2610
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:05,840
myself to start doing these projects is

2611
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,760
i started streaming it on twitch

2612
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,120
so when i'm like all right cool i have

2613
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,800
these two broken guitars i need to

2614
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,000
repair

2615
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,520
let me fire up twitch and i'm gonna

2616
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,199
repair them on stream and that's cool

2617
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:16,480
because you get to meet new people and

2618
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:17,440
make new friends

2619
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,840
i'm at least verbally discussing things

2620
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:20,800
with people i'm

2621
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,719
still educating people like i like to

2622
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:24,320
i'm still working doing things i like

2623
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:24,960
doing

2624
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,080
and now i also don't feel like i'm

2625
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,239
wasting my time doing them because

2626
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:30,639
twitch um so that's that's a new thing

2627
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:32,480
i'm doing in kovit to stay sane

2628
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,800
you know i used to go speak all at least

2629
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,320
monthly somewhere

2630
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,199
and that kind of lets me still get that

2631
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:39,600
itch

2632
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:43,120
scratch that itch um while not really

2633
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:46,239
twitch it's not as great and twitch has

2634
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:46,880
its own

2635
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:50,000
problems and [ __ ] but um it's

2636
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,920
it's been fun and i'm surprised at the

2637
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,159
response that i've gotten off of it

2638
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:56,080
that's awesome for sure yeah i've been

2639
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,840
doing the same thing i've been trying to

2640
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,639
do some house projects and we just got

2641
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:01,199
chickens

2642
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:04,000
too so there is an amazing twitch

2643
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,440
chicken stream

2644
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,040
i should check that out i'm not i'm not

2645
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,400
even on twitch i was like i was just

2646
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:11,280
looking at it

2647
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,280
um so actually i there's a a uh

2648
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,600
system called our chicken life is by the

2649
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,120
way it's twitch.com

2650
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,520
our chicken life and it's just chickens

2651
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:22,639
and you get to spend

2652
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:26,639
50 baits and getting some snacks

2653
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:29,199
it's great it's the most zen [ __ ] i

2654
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:30,960
always get

2655
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,040
chicken posts now and so somebody had

2656
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,320
one of like a

2657
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:37,440
chicken with a there's a race car and

2658
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,199
had chicken feet on the back and it was

2659
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:40,800
a race car like a track and like all

2660
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:41,679
these chickens were

2661
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:43,280
chasing it and then there was like

2662
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,880
announcer announcing the winners of the

2663
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,320
chickens and all this kind of stuff

2664
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:47,760
i'm like i'm doing that so i went and

2665
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,920
got one of these race cars in it for my

2666
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:50,639
chickens

2667
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:54,320
yeah and um and

2668
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,480
sorry no you're down a bunch of chickens

2669
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,080
the chat distracted me

2670
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:01,120
but uh sorry

2671
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:03,440
so so i got the written but so i and i

2672
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:07,839
put a bunch of there's a chat

2673
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,960
no i put a bunch of feed in the in the

2674
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,159
back of this car

2675
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,120
i'm like all right the chickens are

2676
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,360
gonna love this and um

2677
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,360
they were terrified of the race car so

2678
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,360
now now the chickens are just

2679
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,280
i use it to hurt them back into the coop

2680
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,800
if they're out and about i can't get

2681
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,560
them back in

2682
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:30,239
that's pretty hilarious i grew up

2683
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:32,239
we used to breed rabbits so i had

2684
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:34,719
rabbits and ducks growing up

2685
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:36,320
nice i've been wanting i've been losing

2686
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,080
ducks is the next thing i want but i got

2687
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,800
to get some ducks

2688
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:44,400
they're mean and rapey i

2689
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:48,080
my ducks were perfectly fine

2690
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,880
because you domesticated them but like

2691
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,800
you know wild ducks yeah like they're

2692
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,080
they're they're actually one of the

2693
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,960
rapiest uh animals out there besides

2694
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:05,920
dolphins

2695
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,719
i don't know what it is no that's true

2696
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:09,280
like

2697
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,600
any of the podcasts that i come on end

2698
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,960
up involving

2699
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,199
duck rape and i don't understand it's

2700
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:16,159
because

2701
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:17,520
it's probably because there was like a

2702
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,520
cracked article on it once no no

2703
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,760
no no i know i know what it is uh this

2704
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:22,800
is uh

2705
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,639
god do you guys remember a youtube guy

2706
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:27,199
named z frank he got known for sad cat

2707
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:28,080
diaries

2708
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,159
that was the big thing he went viral for

2709
01:31:30,159 --> 01:31:31,520
and he also did sad cat

2710
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,760
or sad dog diary they're adorable you

2711
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,280
should watch them yeah they're on tick

2712
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,239
tock now

2713
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:39,280
he does uh a bunch of other videos he

2714
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,960
has a very morgan freeman voice so it's

2715
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,520
they're really nice and fun to listen to

2716
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,080
um

2717
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,000
but he does the truth about and he picks

2718
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,440
random animals so there's been like the

2719
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:48,080
truth about

2720
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,920
ducks there's like truth about i think

2721
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,600
he did chinchillas once

2722
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,400
a bunch of random animals he did ducks

2723
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:57,040
and he went through this whole spiel

2724
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,880
and he explained how they're extremely

2725
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,639
rapey as in this video

2726
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:02,960
teaches you that over the years a female

2727
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,400
duck's vagina has

2728
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:07,600
evolved off the rape

2729
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,440
this is a fallacy ducks being rapey does

2730
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:12,719
not inherently mean

2731
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:15,840
all other animals are not rapey no no

2732
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,440
you're i said they were the most rapey

2733
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:18,480
along with dolphins

2734
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,800
right and so i'm saying how do you judge

2735
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,000
most rapey

2736
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,440
do you know how many animals there are

2737
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,520
like how do you even determine consent

2738
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:26,880
within the animal

2739
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,600
because the china wards off the penis

2740
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,760
because

2741
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,639
just so into it that they created that

2742
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:35,440
vagina

2743
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:38,560
using the fact the period of time a

2744
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,280
female's duck is now like their vagina

2745
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,280
is a corkscrew shape and it has evolved

2746
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:43,760
to be

2747
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:46,560
an opposite corkscrew shape so hopefully

2748
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,239
the male ducks penis won't make it in

2749
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:49,040
there

2750
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:52,480
this is the way i look at it humans are

2751
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,520
super rapey

2752
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,080
as well and our vaginas have actually

2753
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,199
not even evolved

2754
01:32:57,199 --> 01:32:59,679
to stop that but a ducks has so that's

2755
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:00,800
what i took it on

2756
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,040
uh if but i think we as like super

2757
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,320
reaping humans like

2758
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:07,920
our rapiness is is is psychological

2759
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,840
convincing

2760
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,480
i'm just i'm just saying if if a speed

2761
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,320
like an animal's body

2762
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:17,600
has evolved to have a vagina that

2763
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:18,480
hopefully can

2764
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,400
stop the rape how do you know that

2765
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,440
vagina wasn't the first one

2766
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:26,719
i mean i was told they were changed

2767
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,800
like what if if it changed what i mean

2768
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,679
there's a prior one

2769
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,480
conspiracy i mean i'm with bonnie and

2770
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,480
this one the evidence suggests

2771
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,080
i mean i think she's got a logical

2772
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,239
argument here that the only reason why

2773
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:42,000
dolphins take it takes

2774
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,360
number one spot is because they will

2775
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,360
rape things out of their species

2776
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,199
ducks keep it to ducks how do you know

2777
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:50,080
that uh there's been lots of articles no

2778
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,520
i mean how do you know ducks keep it the

2779
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:52,800
ducks

2780
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,320
i'm just saying the date you just don't

2781
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:55,840
have a large enough because because it

2782
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,520
hasn't there hasn't been information

2783
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,880
coming out saying that ducks

2784
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,840
granted they did it that's my point if

2785
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,679
you're relying on whatever comes across

2786
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,120
your reddit feed

2787
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,960
to determine like that's what creates

2788
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,480
your game

2789
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:11,360
no you're myspace

2790
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:12,960
no i'm just saying there haven't been

2791
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,040
reports of ducks raping things outside

2792
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:15,600
ducks

2793
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,120
but there have been reports of dolphins

2794
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,199
raping outside dolphins so that puts

2795
01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:20,800
dolphins in my mind ahead

2796
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,880
but ducks have raped dead ducks that's a

2797
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,159
that that has been

2798
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:27,360
so dolphins raped just

2799
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:29,840
other animals in the water yeah so

2800
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,120
dolphins

2801
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:34,560
dolphins self-stimulate um

2802
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:37,920
i guess masturbate might be the word uh

2803
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,639
and so they inherently by way of that

2804
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:41,440
just kind of rub

2805
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,360
themselves against whatever they come

2806
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,960
across which

2807
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:47,970
can be other animals uh and so yeah

2808
01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:50,320
[Laughter]

2809
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,400
so what's like what's the glory hole of

2810
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:53,760
the ocean like what are

2811
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,440
what what's like what is like their

2812
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,440
favorite thing is this the is this the

2813
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,280
the point of the podcast where probably

2814
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:01,520
the things that lay still like

2815
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:05,679
what's the glory hill of the axe yes

2816
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:07,679
yep what's the glory of the ocean i

2817
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:09,119
would say things that probably lie in

2818
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:10,080
the bottom of the ocean that don't

2819
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,719
really move so it's easily accessed

2820
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:14,320
is but getting to the bottom of the

2821
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:15,679
ocean is very difficult for most

2822
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:16,400
creatures

2823
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,840
well it depends on which part of the

2824
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,440
ocean it was you want it it's not

2825
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,199
it's not like a super deep part of the

2826
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:23,199
ocean i mean i guess

2827
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:25,040
in real life glory holes are in places

2828
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:26,960
where everyone goes they're in airports

2829
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,080
and truck stops

2830
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,920
you know they're in very heavily uh

2831
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:32,000
maybe the glory hole is the dolphin

2832
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,239
itself

2833
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:36,880
no because the like like if i don't if i

2834
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,119
don't want to experience a glory hole

2835
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:40,719
that's very easy for me to do

2836
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:43,119
whereas if a dolphin wants you to

2837
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:44,080
experience it

2838
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:47,360
it's hard to avoid them dolphins have

2839
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:47,840
like

2840
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:50,080
i mean they'll be like 400 dolphins in

2841
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,280
an orgy like they

2842
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:54,719
they get after it they party hard

2843
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:56,960
and then

2844
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:01,119
i wouldn't want four people in my orgy

2845
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:03,360
well i don't know

2846
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,760
i don't know that all dolphins do either

2847
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,400
i feel like

2848
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,080
less oh that's a bit all right good

2849
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:11,840
that's a solid point

2850
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:13,119
i just want to make the point that i

2851
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:14,639
think if it's less than four people it's

2852
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:15,600
by definition

2853
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,199
not gorgi i think it needs to be

2854
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:18,639
actually more than four like

2855
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:19,840
you can have up to three some but i

2856
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,119
think foursome i don't think that's the

2857
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:21,760
line of an

2858
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,880
orgy i think it still needs more

2859
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:26,639
could just be a pair two pairs

2860
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:28,080
essentially half the time

2861
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,000
this is we what we can do we've gotten

2862
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,119
very off topic

2863
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:32,880
i don't you just go look at this welcome

2864
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,400
to radio stattler

2865
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,000
[Laughter]

2866
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,159
where we come onto your podcast and make

2867
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:40,880
it just like our podcast

2868
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,960
yeah to be fair like kyle started this

2869
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:43,920
yeah i did i

2870
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,840
well you guys you guys uh you wrote me

2871
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,840
in you guys oh we didn't you know

2872
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,360

2873
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:50,960

2874
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,880
i know but i'm just saying like you guys

2875
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,679

2876
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:58,639
oh god oh

2877
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:02,960
sorry i'll rub off on you all right

2878
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:04,400
that's a good uh

2879
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:07,119
good way to end the podcast i think um

2880
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:07,760
what's your

2881
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,440
what's your guys's final thoughts you

2882
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,600
guys got any words of hope

2883
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:15,040
wish us luck yeah we're gonna need it

2884
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:18,159
yeah this is i mean hope is nine

2885
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:21,840
days nine days like you want to talk

2886
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,920
about like virtual conferences like

2887
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,600
going over the top and being like all

2888
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,480
right we don't need this nine days

2889
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:31,040
nine days and it happened very quickly

2890
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,320
this wasn't a thing they were planning

2891
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:33,199
for nine days

2892
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:35,040
and i still don't know what platform

2893
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:36,320
we're streaming on yeah

2894
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,320
this is a last minute choice for them

2895
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,159
and so it's becoming a last-minute thing

2896
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:41,280
for everybody

2897
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,040
how many hours of radio is that i can't

2898
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,040
even do nine times 24.

2899
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:48,400
um i actually i did the math

2900
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,360
so they had us um it's in my inbox let

2901
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,679
me see

2902
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:56,400
how many hours how much time frame would

2903
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:57,440
you need so for

2904
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,440
for the workshops they ask you like how

2905
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,520
much time do you need for your workshop

2906
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,080
and it's like

2907
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:05,280
uh at most 216 hours

2908
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:08,880
yeah yeah like well nine days is how

2909
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:09,760
long our workshop

2910
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:13,679
is uh the the upside is that we know we

2911
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:15,199
control radio statler and there's no

2912
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:16,719
requirements put on it

2913
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:20,400
and so we can we can have dead air

2914
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,400
i mean you don't have to stream for 260

2915
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:23,600
dollars you can stream for

2916
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,800
are you going to try to oh yeah i mean

2917
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,400
yeah i think the goal is to do it

2918
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:31,840
and i it's going to be late night hours

2919
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,440
that might go dead but i think yeah

2920
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,600
the problem is just having someone

2921
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:36,880
having someone who can man

2922
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:39,440
the station for 216 hours that's the

2923
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:40,239
problem

2924
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:42,159
i'm a big fan of like the 3 a.m open

2925
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:43,440
night open mic like

2926
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,880
if you want to come in and just scream

2927
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,199
baba bowie for two hours like come on in

2928
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:48,880
and we get that and it happened that's

2929
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,560
that's what radio styler is

2930
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:51,840
and it's fine because we didn't have

2931
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,639
anything else going on yeah

2932
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:56,080
the late like the late night shows are

2933
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,760
some of my favorites hands down because

2934
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:58,880
that's when you get like just the

2935
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,320
weirdest

2936
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:04,080
[ __ ] um come on in oh and it's also when

2937
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:05,840
you're after 26 o'clock

2938
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,239
and then you have like drunk board game

2939
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:09,760
nights and then like in between

2940
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,800
like 5 a.m and seven it's either dead

2941
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,159
silent or you're just going

2942
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:15,440
yeah and it's because that's when the

2943
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:16,880
rest of the world is waking up too so

2944
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:17,679
that's when you get a lot of your

2945
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:19,840
listeners outside of the country

2946
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:22,239
um and so yeah especially our nighttime

2947
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:22,880
hours

2948
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:25,920
is daytime for a lot of other people and

2949
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:26,480
so

2950
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,519
it's been quite popular

2951
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,239
sweet well um i'm i'm excited to join if

2953
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:39,600
yeah yeah after that dolphin comment i

2954
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,320
feel like

2955
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,920
that's more of a like 3am kind of

2956
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,440
conversation you've already put yourself

2957
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,400
into this now

2958
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,360
there is so there's this um this thing

2959
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:48,080
that

2960
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:51,679
um that we did one time we called it

2961
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:54,159
is it space junk and it's a fun game

2962
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:55,280
where you get drunk

2963
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:58,000
and you listen to electronic music and

2964
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,560
when a new song comes on

2965
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:03,280
um you close your eyes and you try to

2966
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:04,880
picture where you are and if you're in

2967
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,320
space and there's a bunch of junk flying

2968
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,840
around it's space junk and if it's not

2969
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:10,239
that then it's not space junk so

2970
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:11,920
that's a fun game to play when you're

2971
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,600
when you're drunk and you're just

2972
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:15,840
goofing off we could actually play

2973
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:18,480
sounds of space though too

2974
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,480
that's true and that sounds actually

2975
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:23,600
very calming while drunk even

2976
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,280
i i will also agree with that except for

2977
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,360
saturn the sounds of saturn are

2978
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:28,960
literally like the sounds of hell we

2979
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:30,080
will not

2980
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:33,199
put that over 100 i'm gonna put that no

2981
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:37,040
oh i'm doing it it's too late

2982
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,320
i listened to it there were sounds of

2983
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,800
each planet and saturn was

2984
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,639
literally hell it's awful

2985
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:45,840
the rest of them are very nice and

2986
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,199
calming and peaceful and i love them

2987
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:49,520
very zen

2988
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:52,320
all right well we'll we'll debate it on

2989
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,239
uh radio statler

2990
01:40:54,239 --> 01:40:58,560
i submit that saturn is space junk so

2991
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,480
well it's rings on me its rings are

2992
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:05,839
definitely space junk yeah

2993
01:41:08,990 --> 01:41:11,920
[Laughter]

2994
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:14,560
what's up fight me bro but i think about

2995
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,000
space junk as like

2996
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,679
satellites and [ __ ] like that like [ __ ]

2997
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:19,440
that we put up no i'll fight saturn on

2998
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:19,840
air

2999
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,000
you get saturn on air and we'll we'll

3000
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,199
settle this all right

3001
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:26,400
my bets on saturn all right

3002
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,360
bringing on saturn saturn has shitty

3003
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:30,480
arguments

3004
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,119
sentence our

3005
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:39,390
sounds like [ __ ] dialing up to aol

3006
01:41:39,390 --> 01:41:40,880
[Laughter]

3007
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:43,280
oh man i missed the dial update do you

3008
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:45,440
no that's a weird sentence

3009
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,760
i just missed that sound like i get such

3010
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,159
a nostalgia from that sound

3011
01:41:50,159 --> 01:41:52,080
you are aware that you don't have to use

3012
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,840
dial up to hear the sound i was gonna

3013
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,440
say set your phone ringtone to it but

3014
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,440
nobody calls people anymore okay i guess

3015
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,119
i guess i miss the sound i don't miss

3016
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:00,800
the slowness and the the

3017
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,119
how crappy it was but at first just you

3018
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:04,800
gotta set that for like every time you

3019
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,679
get a text

3020
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:07,520
that's what goes on yeah so if you're

3021
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,520
having a conversation it's just a

3022
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:14,080
cavalcade of computers dialing up fax

3023
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:16,559
machines

3024
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:20,560
well guys uh this has been a lot of fun

3025
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:24,320
and um i'm excited to to continue this

3026
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:24,800
journey

3027
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,840
and this has been the record for the

3028
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,320
record of

3029
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:29,840
how many people have been on the cypher

3030
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,440
con podcast

3031
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:34,800
at one time so um let's

3032
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,400
next time we get together let's let's

3033
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,920
beat it all right

3034
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,840
we can bring the numbers let's bring the

3035
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,679
numbers let's get this let's get real

3036
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:42,320
weird

3037
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:45,040
okay you should do that like once a

3038
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,560
quarter do an episode where you invite

3039
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:47,679
the entire internet

3040
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:49,520
to join your podcast and you just put it

3041
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:51,040
on twitter um

3042
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:52,480
let me tell you hey that's not a bad

3043
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:54,239
idea uh art

3044
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:56,080
johnny you know system and trivia they

3045
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,440
do that also where they

3046
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:00,719
yeah they do it once a year

3047
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:03,360
or just forgot about that i've been like

3048
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:04,719
twice and that's

3049
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:07,440
those so they're probably they have a

3050
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,360
big barrier

3051
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,600
uh because you have to like get mumble

3052
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:12,880
all set up with their certificate and

3053
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,400
[ __ ] so like nobody joins

3054
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,000
who is just screwing around like anyone

3055
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
who joins like has a purpose and intent

3056
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,920
and so that kind of ruins it i feel like

3057
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,239
whereas if you just post like your

3058
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:24,480
hangouts link can go

3059
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,600
hi though hangouts is still prohibitive

3060
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:28,400
because it's uh

3061
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,400
like 10 it used to be like a 10 person

3062
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,400
cap

3063
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:33,760
oh yeah you can have 10 people and then

3064
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,679
you can [ __ ] yourself like

3065
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:38,880
uh-huh number 11 get out of here

3066
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,119
does not go to 11. i got it look i got a

3067
01:43:41,119 --> 01:43:42,320
200 meg pipe here

3068
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:47,040
we can i can push audio pretty hard

3069
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:51,280
antarctica you're on the air that are

3070
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,639
together you're on the air

3071
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:55,440
yeah antarctica let's uh let's get you

3072
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:57,679
guys in this here

3073
01:43:57,679 --> 01:43:59,840
let's get you guys anyone out there if

3074
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:00,719
you've got hookups

3075
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:03,520
no people bring them because that's the

3076
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:04,639
thing is everyone says they know

3077
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:06,159
somebody like oh i got my cousin's

3078
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:06,560
brother

3079
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:10,880
works in a space station in antarctica

3080
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:13,360
what i'm still surprised that there's

3081
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:14,400
not just one

3082
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:17,119
city like there's not there's no cities

3083
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:18,560
there's there are no cities there's zero

3084
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:19,199
cities

3085
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:21,520
but there's more than one place we got

3086
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:23,520
one russia's got one china's got one oh

3087
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:23,840
yeah

3088
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,840
probably indiana it's because we can't

3089
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,119
work together

3090
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:28,480
well they all work together so they're

3091
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,239
on different places and they share data

3092
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:30,960
and correct like

3093
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,480
it's like space like there's a russian

3094
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,480
space station that we share

3095
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:36,719
you know yeah scientists are generally

3096
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:38,639
good at sharing there's not a lot of

3097
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:41,360
like weird patriotism in that realm

3098
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,239
hopefully yeah

3099
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:44,080
general but let's get antarctica to

3100
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,840
listen to radio statler live that's all

3101
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,840
we need

3102
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,920
right guys it's some kind of screenshot

3103
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,880
as evidence

3104
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:52,320
if you know somebody working in

3105
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:54,400
antarctica in a couple weeks who

3106
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,239
has access to streaming audio on the

3107
01:44:56,239 --> 01:44:57,600
internet please

3108
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:01,040
