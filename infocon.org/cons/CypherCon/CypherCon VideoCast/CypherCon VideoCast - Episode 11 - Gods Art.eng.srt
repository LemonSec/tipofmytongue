00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,239
the earlier podcasts

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,600
i think i can't even remember which

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,279
episode it was like three or something

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,480
like that that's what i was thinking

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,600
yeah something like that

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,039
um and uh we had we had a ton of fun

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,599
talking i remember we talked about the

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,599
um the radio frequency identification

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,880
in the cars the rfid was it rfid

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,920
um um

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,399
yeah yeah yeah like uh breaking into uh

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,440
cars with uh

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,559
our uh sdr

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,800
and yeah it's basically just replay

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,559
attack where you record the

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,280
the code coming from the remote and then

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,879
replay it to open the car

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,480
yeah that was cool i really enjoyed

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,879
learning about all that stuff and and uh

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,520
that was a lot that was a lot of fun um

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,399
and since then

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,840
and so if if you haven't listened to

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,120
that episode i recommend going back to

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,239
it because uh it was

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,280
fascinating learning about all that and

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,320
since then you have uh you've

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,880
you've packed up and moved to georgia

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,360
and

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,000
uh we were talking a little bit about

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,439
that before we started recording i'm

38
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,880
like no no save it for the podcast let's

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,400
talk about it then so

40
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,320
i wanted to hear a little bit about uh

41
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,920
your decision to move to georgia

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,320
uh you know and uh you know why you'd

43
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,040
wanna

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,560
leave a snowy uh wintry wonderland

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,119
wisconsin and go down to georgia and how

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,479
that

47
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,920
and how that's played out for you

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
yeah well i actually will miss i won't

49
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,520
miss the cold but i will miss the snow i

50
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,240
actually do really

51
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,520
actually like the snow um in wisconsin

52
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:45,920
but

53
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,759
yeah you know a couple years ago we were

54
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,200
watching i was watching some old home

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,960
videos and i grew up kind of in kentucky

56
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,600
more and

57
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,320
okay more in the country um and you know

58
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,240
i remember moving from chicago down to

59
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,119
kentucky

60
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,680
as a kid and it was like going to heaven

61
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,560
i mean

62
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,399
it was and i just watched the video and

63
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,759
i was like you know what i couldn't give

64
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,159
my

65
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,240
my kids anything better like more

66
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,439
enjoyable than

67
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,120
uh what i had as a kid um

68
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,879
you know being in the woods and stuff uh

69
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,959
and it was that plus it was also

70
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,040
you know selfish for me too because you

71
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,120
know i i was kind of tired of being in

72
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,920
the city

73
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,360
um i i really like uh i i wanted more

74
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,080
mountains

75
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,440
and woods and um

76
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,800
you know that's just kind of more i

77
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,640
think

78
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,840
my kind of vibe um in addition to

79
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,239
there was you know seeing the um

80
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,040
polarization in the country and things

81
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,560
like that and also just

82
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,480
you know looking at the infrastructure

83
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,599
looking at the infrastructure that we

84
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,239
live in

85
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,400
um where it's uh with you know

86
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,760
electricity and the internet are so

87
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,440
critical that if it went out

88
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,519
um the city would be a very difficult

89
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,200
place to be

90
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,480
so that's kind of that's kind of uh the

91
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,440
main reasons for for moving gotcha so

92
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,480
you so you grew up

93
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,760
uh in in the you know oh in the country

94
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,519
yeah i mean a little bit of both we

95
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,920
moved back and more into the city when i

96
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,440
was probably like

97
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,599
14 or something like that so i was out

98
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,879
in the country for you know

99
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,519
maybe five years or a little more or

100
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,599
less something like that

101
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,319
cool and so so how's it been when we're

102
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:24,879
watching

103
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,360
uh as as we're recording this you're out

104
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,519
in your uh you you have a

105
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,239
uh horse stable on the on the property

106
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:32,799
and

107
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,760
uh you kind of got into you're doing it

108
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,640
from this space

109
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,480
to get a little bit of privacy and i

110
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,239
have you know a bunch of

111
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,840
kids trying to beg you for your

112
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,519
attention while we're doing the podcast

113
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,840
but it's also making for a pretty cool

114
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,040
unique podcast

115
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,519
uh so tell me about this uh this the

116
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,640
stable you got on the property

117
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,239
oh yeah um uh yeah it's just

118
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,879
in this this whole barn that we got um

119
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,480
but i'm trying to fix it up and kind of

120
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,080
make it into like a

121
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,920
a little bit more of a livable space

122
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,200
filling in the cracks and that kind of

123
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,000
stuff

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
um it's like a man cave you're gonna

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,280
have it be like your man cave

126
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,360
or something or i mean i probably will i

127
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,879
actually probably will use it as that

128
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,160
um a little bit um but also just uh

129
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,079
our house is only three bedroom and we

130
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,160
have uh a family member

131
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,759
living with us plus our kids so we don't

132
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,199
actually have any guest rooms

133
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,840
um and we like having people over and

134
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,800
stuff so

135
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,680
it's it's not the best guest room but um

136
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,240
i'm

137
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,919
trying to make it more comfy and stuff

138
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,880
uh uh just moved about 3000 pounds of

139
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,759
rocks in here

140
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,280
uh earlier today wow need to get a

141
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,400
little bit more

142
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,040
um uh it wasn't quite enough to fill the

143
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,560
whole floor but

144
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,600
um yeah i mean you know kind of glam

145
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,080
it'd be kind of like a glamping spot so

146
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,840
you know it won't be

147
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,240
super great but hopefully better than

148
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,199
camping

149
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,360
cool did you did you harvest the rocks

150
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,040
yourself did you go to the quarry

151
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,120
no no that would be a lot of work

152
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,479
cool well that's pretty cool it's

153
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,240
delivered it sounds like you're trying

154
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,080
to be a little bit more self-sustaining

155
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,039
it you know

156
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,479
you talk a little bit about you know if

157
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,320
the internet went down or whatever

158
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,639
like you you know being in the city it's

159
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,919
going to be a mess

160
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,360
right so it's part of it you know

161
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,280
you're kind of looking to be you know

162
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,639
more self-sufficient

163
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,639
yeah yeah that's definitely a lot of it

164
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,000
um

165
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,639
we actually back in 2019 we my family

166
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,360
and i did a a month-long glamping

167
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,120
or not glamping boondocking trip um

168
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,240
looking kind of looking partially

169
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,199
looking for a new home um

170
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,320
but it's kind of amazing when you

171
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,919
when you do like when you're boondocking

172
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,039
you're just out in the woods you know we

173
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,240
didn't have a camp or anything we were

174
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,919
tent camping and all that

175
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,560
but my wife my wife uh whitney she

176
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,600
wanted um

177
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,840
a hot shot having a nice warm shower was

178
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,759
a non-negotiable for her

179
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,360
so you know we had we had a little setup

180
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
where like i tap you know tap a creek

181
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,319
and that kind of stuff

182
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,840
and um use use a propane heater and i

183
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,639
got a little

184
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,280
gas generator so i could pump water you

185
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,199
know get hot shower

186
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,160
and you have something to wash your

187
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,639
hands with but anyway

188
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,919
it's kind of interesting like when you

189
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,759
when you really go more

190
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,880
longer term camping like that um

191
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,479
you kind of it was kind of like an

192
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,680
interesting learning experience because

193
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,479
i got to learn

194
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,960
okay what is like the basics i need like

195
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,680
for living

196
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,919
you know and like one of the things was

197
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,680
a water source

198
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,199
you know which i guess is probably an

199
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,800
obvious thing to everyone but

200
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,520
um you know it's just you know you can't

201
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,240
really

202
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,840
you know if i want to have a shower and

203
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,800
i want to be able to drink water and

204
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,600
that kind of stuff

205
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
that's some of the most basic stuff and

206
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,360
so we wanted to find a place where

207
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,800
you know if we needed to do that on our

208
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
own you know if the electricity goes out

209
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,520
um we can we can do that um we can get

210
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,319
water at least

211
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,440
you know i think that's an important

212
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,720
thing probably a good thing for people

213
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,000
to have in mind wherever they're at

214
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,639
really

215
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,120
like if you know obviously electricity

216
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,759
keeps running

217
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,759
or the water keeps getting pumped

218
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,599
usually i think without electricity but

219
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,960
at least for a period of time with the

220
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,880
water towers but at some point i figure

221
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,680
it would probably

222
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,800
run out um and

223
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,520
uh so yeah that's that was definitely

224
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,479
one thing and just

225
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,000
being able to grow our own food a little

226
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,840
bit you know we're wanting to do that um

227
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,319
so

228
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,160
just have some of the basics um

229
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,599
you know it's kind of amazing as a

230
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,840
culture we've we've become so efficient

231
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,880
and we outsource

232
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,720
more more and more and more stuff that

233
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,319
people have historically done

234
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,919
you know and living is very you know you

235
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,919
see some of those like settlers and

236
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,280
what they went through it's like living

237
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,199
is very difficult but so much of it's

238
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,639
been outsourced for us

239
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,919
but now we don't we we don't have hardly

240
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,880
any of these very

241
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,919
very basic living skills um like getting

242
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
water and getting food and

243
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,919
building shelter and so i'm wanting to

244
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,199
get more of that kind of stuff

245
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,319
and you know i want my kids to be able

246
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,599
to get a little bit more of that kind of

247
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,199
understanding and

248
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,960
you know that's the case yeah i think

249
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,560
survival skills are probably one of the

250
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,639
most important skills to have and it's

251
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,400
like you know most people don't know him

252
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,840
at all right and

253
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,280
yeah i think it's funny that you

254
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,720
mentioned that about the showers there's

255
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,680
um

256
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,840
uh there's a trip that my wife and i we

257
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,720
take with

258
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,240
a couple of our friends every year we

259
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
take a week and we go

260
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,680
we started three years ago we went to

261
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,280
the boundary waters three years ago then

262
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,879
we went to the apostle islands and then

263
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,599
we went to

264
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,560
last year we went to sylvania and uh so

265
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,759
we've just been doing

266
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,680
canoe kayak trips where we go out into

267
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,199
the wilderness for a week

268
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,680
and uh it's awesome that's cool i love

269
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,440
it we love it and uh but

270
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,599
one of the people so one of the guys on

271
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,679
that comes on the trip he said

272
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,000
i'm bringing you know a hot shower so we

273
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,519
can have hot showers but he was really

274
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,200
adamant about having his hot showers and

275
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,719
those hot showers are nice

276
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,399
especially when you're out there and

277
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,760
you're all grinding yeah

278
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,160
and uh and so he's got you know you have

279
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,600
the little uh the black

280
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,160
um shower bag and we did the same thing

281
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,440
where he heated up the water

282
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,120
and then we put it in the shower bag and

283
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,040
then you're just hanging up by a tree

284
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,040
limb and then you take a nice hot shower

285
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,519
and it's

286
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,399
uh it's a wonderful thing and then the

287
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,839
other thing is too it's like we we go

288
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,080
out

289
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,519
fishing the whole time and the fit you

290
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,440
catch so many fish and you

291
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,360
eat it and it's like the best food you

292
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,720
know it's so fresh

293
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,920
and amazing and uh i don't know it's

294
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,800
it's a lot of fun

295
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,320
and uh so yeah i mean last so last time

296
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,839
we went yeah we went to

297
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,920
uh sylvania in in july and i was like

298
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,440
um uh you know

299
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,000
sylvania is in the u.p in michigan it's

300
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,800
uh

301
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,720
it's like right over the border of

302
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,920
wisconsin uh

303
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,120
and it's like sort of like a mini

304
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,200
boundary waters so there's like

305
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,440
i don't know maybe eight like maybe more

306
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,240
but

307
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,880
i think we paddled like eight lakes and

308
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,720
uh you know you portage between them and

309
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,839
all that kind of stuff and uh i remember

310
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,519
saying like because you know we were in

311
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,360
the midst of of covet

312
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,399
and everything and um and i'm like if we

313
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,040
get out

314
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,640
and there's a civil war going on we're

315
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,920
just going to come right back in right

316
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,640
guys so now

317
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,560
that's like that's our plan right we're

318
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,920
just going to come back here

319
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,040
and we're going to hang out and uh so

320
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,320
um so there fortunately

321
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,160
uh there wasn't a civil war when we got

322
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,360
out uh

323
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,839
so um but you know and i think it's it's

324
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,360
interesting you're thinking about those

325
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,880
things like if the grid goes down

326
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,920
what do we do you know and uh right

327
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,000
it's uh you know what is what's your

328
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,440
plan b and you got a good one i got a

329
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,959
well we got a spot up north that's our

330
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,959
plan b but uh

331
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,079
you know that's uh it's uh it's a

332
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,279
interesting thing to be thinking about

333
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,720
well even if it's even if you're in the

334
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,880
city um when i was in milwaukee actually

335
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,560
uh me and one of my neighbors you know

336
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,800
we had plans for you know just in case

337
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,279
things

338
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,320
went down you know um i had a well

339
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,160
you know we could have manually gotten

340
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,519
water if the electricity went out or

341
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,800
used generator

342
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,640
to get water you know that kind of stuff

343
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,160
so you had a well here's a good thing to

344
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,600
think about

345
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,800
yeah it was like it was like a really

346
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
old house and it amazingly had

347
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,240
we were like one of the only wells

348
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,000
anywhere around like

349
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,720
uh yeah did you drink out of the oil or

350
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,279
did you you attached to the city water

351
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,320
we had both um i mean i i could drink

352
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,600
out of the well though he had to go and

353
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,399
get it tested

354
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,880
uh for bacteria and that kind of stuff

355
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,320
so it was drinkable

356
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,399
that's cool that's i i love that space

357
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,160
and i love you know you invited

358
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,920
uh me and some some other guys to do

359
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,360
this uh

360
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,279
we did some art art some painting at

361
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,640
your house and that was that was a blast

362
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,040
yeah

363
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
i had so much fun doing that and i'm not

364
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,320
much of an artist but

365
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,519
it was fun to just like uh you know just

366
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,519
paint some stuff and see what comes out

367
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,160
you know and uh yeah wound up painting

368
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,640
something

369
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,760
i like your it was like a yeah it was

370
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,160
like an

371
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,000
eye it was like a maze it was like a

372
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,519
compass it was like all these kind of

373
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,079
things combined in it and it was uh

374
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,920
it was a weird thing that just came out

375
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,440
of me that i wasn't really

376
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,560
consciously thinking about but um that

377
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,399
was that was a really unique experience

378
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:58,800
i

379
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,839
enjoyed that quite a bit yeah

380
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,920
yeah that was a good time it's fun to

381
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
just do art even if you're not super

382
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,760
good at it it's just i think it's

383
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,680
healthy you got to let that

384
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,040
heart have its play yeah absolutely and

385
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,680
have you been

386
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,120
uh you've still been painting you've

387
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,600
been doing a lot of painting

388
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,720
i was just telling a friend today

389
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,800
earlier today i don't i've not paid

390
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,440
like in probably a good nine months or

391
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,079
something we're gonna

392
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,279
i've got a friend coming over to visit

393
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,560
sometime soon we're like we're

394
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,920
definitely doing a painting party

395
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,639
you know so we will have a while but

396
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,760
we'll be safe

397
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,800
what you have been doing uh is the the

398
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,000
math art which i've been

399
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
i've been loving all of the fractal art

400
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,600
that you've been doing uh

401
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,800
you know using uh fractal equations in

402
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,519
python

403
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,839
and uh can you tell me a little bit

404
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,519
about how you started doing that and

405
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,639
what that process is like

406
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,519
yeah um yeah i mean i i was actually

407
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,560
thinking about how did i

408
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,000
get to doing this stuff the other day

409
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,440
and i was like okay i guess it started

410
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,959
in high school when i was like

411
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,639
when i first saw a graphing calculator

412
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,320
and i was like oh you can draw with math

413
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,680
that's super cool

414
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,480
um and uh you know you don't have to be

415
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,200
perfect at

416
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
drawing in a circle you can just have to

417
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,800
write the equation and it draws a circle

418
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,440
for you

419
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,320
on the old ti-85 calculators or whatever

420
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,040
those were

421
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,760
yeah yeah yeah the ti 83 89 that kind of

422
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,320
stuff

423
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,240
um yeah i remember just being fascinated

424
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,920
by that and you know

425
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,320
um and a couple years ago i actually

426
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,279
wrote a

427
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,839
my own graphing tool uh it's actually no

428
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,160
one no one knows about it's on github

429
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,800
um it's called truthy graph i think or

430
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,880
truthy gra it's either truthy graph

431
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,399
or truthy graphy it's um but it's a very

432
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,920
simple graphing program

433
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,839
it's just in your web browser so you can

434
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,199
you can even try it kyle um

435
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,320
yeah i'm definitely gonna check it out

436
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,760
and i'll put it in the show notes when i

437
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,360
find it so if anyone else wants to check

438
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,959
it out uh they should be in a link in

439
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,240
the show notes uh

440
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,399
so you can check yeah actually little uh

441
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,480
little cryptography thing the the

442
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,880
the the default equation that's graphed

443
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,000
on it is one of the

444
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,120
elliptic curve cryptography equations um

445
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,079
i think actually

446
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,920
like for oh yeah that's right i think

447
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,519
what at the time i was

448
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,680
i was doing some research into uh

449
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,040
elliptic uh

450
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,279
curve cryptography for work and i was

451
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,320
like

452
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,000
i was like okay how does this stuff work

453
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,199
and i kind of got into this bit of a

454
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,240
rabbit hole where

455
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,160
i'm looking into it and i'm like

456
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,600
graphing the equation

457
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,440
and i i think i wanted a prettier way to

458
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,199
graph it or something like that and so i

459
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,480
wrote this little

460
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,399
tool called truthy graph and like i said

461
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,839
it's on github uh

462
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,360
and it's like it's on github and it's

463
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,279
also hosted on github pages so

464
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,000
i think the url um is uh

465
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,240
truthygraph.github.io

466
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,079
if i remember right that's what

467
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,560
truthygraph.github.io

468
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,320
but anyway what what most graphs do

469
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,160
if you know if you're on a ti 89

470
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,000
calculator or whatever and you graph

471
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,360
you know x equals y squared

472
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,680
or sorry y equals x squared and you get

473
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,880
a parabolic shape

474
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,360
you know well what it's showing you

475
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,000
there is

476
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,720
where there is zero error there's the

477
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,079
left and right side of the equations are

478
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,839
precisely the same

479
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,279
right you know so y equals x squared

480
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,199
um it draws a line where you know at 0 0

481
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,440
y equals x squared the zero equals zero

482
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,240
squared

483
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,360
um you know and on up the graph but what

484
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
truthy graph does is it shows you a

485
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,240
gradient

486
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,120
and it shows you basically as the error

487
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,519
gets away

488
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,279
uh from graphs show you only where the

489
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,720
error in the equation and the size of

490
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,839
the equation is zero

491
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,440
truthy graph shows you it colors it for

492
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,399
you so you actually

493
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,480
see the error not just the black and

494
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,399
white of where it's true and fault

495
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,880
true you know it's showing you i don't

496
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,000
know if that makes sense but it

497
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,519
it ends up creating all these pretty

498
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,600
gradient gradients and that kind of

499
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,639
stuff

500
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,279
so in the case of y equals x squared

501
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,160
what would it

502
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,600
show would it show you where where

503
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,360
would it color in where why doesn't

504
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,199
equal x squared

505
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,000
yeah yeah yeah and basically the like

506
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,600
the line will be

507
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,639
uh brighter wherever they are equal but

508
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,160
it'll be dimmer and dimmer

509
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,480
the less true the less true the equation

510
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,920
is until it fades out

511
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,480
okay and you can kind of adjust you can

512
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,839
adjust how much of the air to show

513
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,199
basically

514
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,399
um anyway so i that that's kind of a

515
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,120
cool little

516
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,320
tool um but but

517
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,560
i kind of well then i got into like the

518
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,480
like you know the

519
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,040
sdr radio hacking stuff and so i was

520
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,199
learning about like waves and

521
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,880
more math for that kind of stuff and so

522
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,480
basically i pivoted

523
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,959
this art stuff was kind of pivoting from

524
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:37,759
the math

525
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,759
stuff i i played around with with the

526
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,959
radio stuff

527
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,360
into the visual space so i was basically

528
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,480
using a lot of like

529
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,600
similar some similar math

530
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,480
um that i was using for like hacking you

531
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:50,959
know

532
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,680
cars with radio waves and just showing

533
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,639
that same math

534
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,440
visually so some of it or some of the

535
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:57,839
same

536
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,160
basic kinds of maps especially like wave

537
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,240
i do a lot of waves i

538
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,679
i it's kind of funny like waves are this

539
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,439
like weird pet topic of mine my wife

540
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,959
said i should write a kids book about

541
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,160
uh waves but anyway do it you should

542
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,880
totally do it

543
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,839
um so what's your favorite wave

544
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,640
are you a sine wave um yeah i mean i

545
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,160
just generally like

546
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,760
yeah i like science waves they just show

547
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,959
up everywhere you know that's a lot of

548
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:27,520
what i use

549
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,640
uh um and yeah so you know with the art

550
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,000
stuff you're asking about that

551
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,039
um you know i basically paint with

552
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,360
these different equations so i'll i'll

553
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,120
show i'll generate

554
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,679
uh these natural patterns like uh what

555
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,520
you might see if you drop

556
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,559
you like the wave patterns you get

557
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,039
with ripples if you like drop a stone in

558
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,880
like a pond or something like that

559
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,919
you get these uh ripple patterns

560
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,640
and you can also get really beautiful

561
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,440
interference

562
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,520
wave interference patterns um if you

563
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,679
have more than one

564
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,120
kind of oscillator going on um

565
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,600
so you can so you know some some things

566
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,480
i might show you

567
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,200
like one of my one of my art things was

568
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,840
like if you

569
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,919
if you dropped six equally sized stones

570
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,360
in water the

571
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,880
wave interference pattern that it

572
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,720
creates would be um

573
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,480
exactly pretty much exactly what the

574
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,760
math is showing

575
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,840
um so it's kind of showing you like real

576
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,880
reality

577
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,440
oh wow it's actually that's it's like i

578
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,880
kind of i basically choose

579
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,400
i basically choose the colors but

580
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,720
all of the structure pretty much comes

581
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,840
from just

582
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,280
very direct mathematics reality

583
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,400
um and i call it i call it god's art

584
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,120
because

585
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,440
i'm outsourcing all of the structure you

586
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,720
know to the

587
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,120
the rules uh that that he wrote or

588
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,480
whatever

589
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,280
yeah wow that's that's fascinating so so

590
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,240
you're just taking

591
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,559
you know the the rules that govern the

592
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,640
universe and making a visual

593
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,320
representation of it yeah exactly

594
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,120
wow um and and so where where can people

595
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,600
find

596
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,760
uh the art that you've been making

597
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,600
because it's it's really cool it's uh

598
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,760
it's it's amazing

599
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,039
yeah thanks thanks kyle um yeah it's uh

600
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,160
my website is uh gods.art so

601
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,360
g-o-d-s dot a-r-t um

602
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,840
it's uh this new art domain name which i

603
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,640
think is kind of cool

604
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,720
but anyway um if you look there i

605
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,320
actually need to update my website again

606
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,520
um but yeah it's there and uh then it's

607
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,720
also got a link i

608
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,080
i've been i've been doing like

609
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,480
tapestries and pillows and

610
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,400
blankets and stuff yeah on this there's

611
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,840
this cool website actually probably a

612
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,720
lot of people would find this

613
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,280
interesting

614
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,679
um it's called society6 have you ever

615
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,840
heard of that i have not no

616
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,840
um it's like this cool website where if

617
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,000
you basically you can just upload any

618
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,080
arbitrary image and you can make all

619
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,840
these different products out of it

620
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,039
so you can make tapestries for example

621
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,600
um you can make custom pillows um

622
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,480
if i had them around i would show you uh

623
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,640
but um

624
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,679
uh yeah

625
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,039
you can make a bunch of stuff just by

626
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,039
uploading an image so i upload my my

627
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:15,679
stuff there

628
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,600
um so you can get you can get the

629
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,200
leggings made you can get like

630
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,320
pillowcases

631
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,919
it's really cool you shower shower

632
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,200
curtains it's actually kind of a cool

633
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,080
product idea

634
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,000
off service offering i think that'd be

635
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
cool if so if you're taking like some

636
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,360
equations that are

637
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,039
like i like the idea of like okay so you

638
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,880
got six rocks and you you they're the

639
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,039
same size and you throw them in water

640
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,360
what happens with the ripples if you can

641
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,280
tell that story i like the idea of you

642
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:39,760
know

643
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,880
because your wife was saying you should

644
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,400
write a book what if you made a book of

645
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:42,960
like

646
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,640
you know a story of like these things

647
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,320
happen and here's the visual

648
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,480
representation of it oh yeah

649
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,080
you know that'd be cool that'd be a cool

650
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,159
little kids book or coffee table book or

651
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,159
you know that that would be awesome i

652
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,440
love that that would be cool

653
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,720
that would be cool i hadn't thought

654
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,919
about putting them together actually

655
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:58,799
that's a good idea

656
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,520
yeah you can make a little story with it

657
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,080
and and

658
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,200
uh yeah that sounds uh i would

659
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,039
i would definitely uh get one for my

660
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,640
coffee table that's for sure

661
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,760
so yeah yeah yeah good point

662
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,039
there's there's that so um

663
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,400
yeah yeah the idea yeah cool um

664
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,600
so let's see here yeah we you know

665
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,960
we we talked about a little bit about

666
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,720
georgia a little bit about art um

667
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,679
is there anything else you want to talk

668
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,960
about or do you want to or should we

669
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,520
wrap this up

670
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,919
um let me think

671
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,159
i guess one thing that comes to mind um

672
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,360
is uh i just wanna maybe uh

673
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,480
this is i guess is a message of peace um

674
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,720
you know i i see so much polarization

675
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,679
right now

676
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,760
in uh the country and probably the world

677
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,600
too um

678
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,159
and the thing is though i i feel like

679
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,919
you have a lot of you got

680
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,799
media that tends to show the extremes

681
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,120
there's a selection bias going on

682
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,880
where the people who are the most

683
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,640
extreme are the ones that you

684
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,880
see and hear yeah but most people i

685
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,080
think are like a lot more

686
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,240
chill and people just need to listen to

687
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,080
each other respect each other

688
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,280
everyone everyone does bad stuff don't

689
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,120
you know you don't have to hate people

690
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,880
uh don't be a hypocrite you do bad stuff

691
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,760
too let's just love

692
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,880
everyone and be peaceful and stop with

693
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,480
the polarization

694
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,400
yeah i love i love that message and i

695
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,320
think uh social media has really

696
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,880
polarized this too you see like

697
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,960
what people pay attention to is the most

698
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,520
extreme thing so they get more attention

699
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,200
on youtube on facebook on twitter

700
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,559
um you know where people are and so

701
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,840
we have this distorted you know

702
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,440
vision of what reality is uh because of

703
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,280
these algorithms that are pro

704
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,320
like literally reprogramming us right so

705
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,400
yeah uh i guess that's another good

706
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,080
reason to disconnect and

707
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,400
uh you know it helps you sink into peace

708
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,159
right i think we're connected to these

709
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,400
devices that are literally reprogramming

710
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,919
our brains to

711
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,960
get glued to the outpage then you know

712
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,280
that's that's what we get you know and

713
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,159
so

714
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,159
it's uh yeah i you know i don't know how

715
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,360
how we undo that other than making a

716
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,960
conscious decision to put down the

717
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,080
devices and

718
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,280
uh enjoy nature right um so yeah i want

719
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,159
to talk to people in person too right

720
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,919
you know just that that's one thing

721
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,280
where you know there's some

722
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
there's i i've got a lot of friends who

723
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,640
like on facebook

724
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,279
uh where if i didn't know them in person

725
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,000
i would like

726
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,240
probably hate i would have hated them

727
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,080
you know like if i if i only knew them

728
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,120
based on their uh their online you know

729
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,159
uh exchanges you know but like in person

730
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,080
they're actually really pleasant

731
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,360
people so it's really strange it's

732
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,720
almost like it brings out the worst in

733
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,679
some people

734
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,679
yeah and it's easier to do it behind a

735
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,200
computer where you're typing you know

736
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,400
like if you're actually in front of

737
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,080
people yeah you don't want to be in it i

738
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,760
mean most people aren't [ __ ] you

739
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,279
know like

740
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,320
um but yeah there's something about uh

741
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,799
doing it from behind the keyboard or

742
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,080
behind the screen

743
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,200
and uh it's it's it's i guess yeah easy

744
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,799
it does bring out the worst in people

745
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,480
sometimes

746
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,320
i guess it almost uh you don't see them

747
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,000
as people or there's some kind of weird

748
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,440
thing where it's maybe maybe it's harder

749
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,799
to see people as people when you don't

750
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,279
see them

751
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,559
in person or something um you know like

752
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,159
drive like when you're driving in cars

753
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:32,720
people

754
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,480
have road rage because you you know

755
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,760
there's a person in there but like you

756
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,640
can't

757
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,840
you almost forget or something yeah

758
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,120
that's a good point yeah

759
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,919
yeah it's like they're they're just some

760
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:44,960
[ __ ] right

761
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,840
they're not a person

762
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,559
what are you doing yeah um

763
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,600
